| 0:08:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chris, what kind of anticipations do you think adjustments will have to make in the budget for the passing of the Improve Act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=507)|
| 0:08:35| In talking to Dwight Vandervate, we think that number as far as an increase in the gas tax is probably around 1.1 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=515)|
| 0:08:49| Now, the key is going to be the offset. So what is the offset of the haul tax? How much more does it decrease over that period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=529)|
| 0:09:01| We'll have to sit down and study that because what we will basically do, I don't want to bore you with accounting jargon, but we do make a transfer from general fund to engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=541)|
| 0:09:17| And so what we will do to offset that decrease in the haul tax is we will decrease that transfer, which will offset the increase in the gasoline tax, which comes straight into the engineering and public works fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=557)|
| 0:09:31| So it won't be 1.1. It may be 800,000. I don't know yet. But we will have to bring that one in the form of an amendment as we do it. Or we'll just estimate and appropriate as we go along through the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=571)|
| 0:09:48| We could do it that way as well. We could estimate and appropriate and let Dwight know what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| Typically budgeted for the haul income tax at a lower amount than we actually receive, do you think the difference will be great enough that there will be no offset needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=596)|
| 0:10:10| The reason our actual is always higher than what we budget for is corrections from previous years. And so while that number still could be inflated, I think the prudent thing to do is to continue to move that budget down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=610)|
| 0:10:27| Because once it goes away, then those corrections go away. And so a lot of times we'll treat those corrections as one time, and that's how we get some of our designations that we bring to you all in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=627)|
| 0:10:41| This year we budgeted 600,000 for the operation of the behavioral health center. In the future, if it does prove to be a cost savings for the detention facility, will that money come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=641)|
| 0:10:55| I think what you would see is this. If the sheriff's department does see a decrease in the expenditures of the DF, the detention facility, it would be in the form of pharmaceuticals and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=655)|
| 0:11:11| So I think what you would see, since both are in the general fund, you would just see a decrease in those operational costs, which ultimately helps to subsidize that amount for the behavioral health urgent care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=671)|
| 0:11:23| Is there any kind of rubrics or any measuring point that we'll be able to define, you know, if it's actually from the diversion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| Because we could have an increase in drugs prescribed to the current population or the future population without any offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=690)|
| 0:11:39| I think in talking to the sheriff and to Allison, I think it's important we have to figure out what is the average increase in pharmaceuticals and maybe trying to figure out that segment of population that we're seeing that's being transferred from one to the other and try to figure out what that savings amount is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=699)|
| 0:11:58| If there are savings and the $600,000 does come back, where will we be able to appropriate that to? Engineering, public works, parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=718)|
| 0:12:10| No, I think, once again, I don't think you would know true savings until closer to the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| And so I think it would be, once again, in the form of designations through budget surplus, and it could go for a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| As you know, you all get a lot of those phone calls, and it varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| And so I'm interested to see what our number will be this year that we get to designate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=751)|
| 0:12:40| We've had an unprecedented run of growth years. Do you see this continuing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=760)|
| 0:12:50| No, it's interesting. If you go look, I mean, if you look on my page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=770)|
| 0:13:06| So you look at property tax. I'm on page 36 of my book, but you look at property tax, and we only go back to 06 in the book, and it would probably go back on further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=786)|
| 0:13:19| You see growth every year ranging from 1.3% to 5%. I mean, that's really, really steady growth in current property tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=799)|
| 0:13:34| Last year's number was 1.86%. I mean, that's great growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| I would say this, and I've said this before, most counties across this state probably don't see growth in property tax that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| It stays pretty flat. So we're fortunate in that we see that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=826)|
| 0:13:55| Things always are different around reappraisal year. We've had some issues this year with the final step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=835)|
| 0:14:06| If you want to challenge, you can go to Equalization Board, but there's also a state Equalization Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| which they can waive two or three years' worth of taxes and make some modifications, and you pay them out in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| So this year's been a bit of a challenge. You've got to look at it because it's all being changed in current year and not hitting the other years that it should hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=857)|
| 0:14:31| I think this year, once again, we'll see growth. I don't know. I think this year 1.3%, 1.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=871)|
| 0:14:41| See how we end the year? Is it as good as last year? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| Still good growth. I go back to when we were in our economic downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| You see those growth numbers. They're actual over actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| I think eventually you probably level off to a certain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| As we continue to grow, I think we're going to always see growth over 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| Do we hit 2%? I don't know. It'd be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| I think eventually you have some leveling off. It's just the nature of the beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| You can do the same thing on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| I will tell you that the stock market has had a really good run, and things are well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=929)|
| 0:15:40| That's not going to continue. There's going to be a correction. It happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| When that happens, we just have to see what type of correction we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| You look back. I'm on page 37 now looking at sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| You look back from 2008 to 2009, and we saw almost a $13 million reduction in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=954)|
| 0:16:02| That's huge. Think about that. $13 million reduction in one year in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| It took us, let me get here, from once that hit, which was 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| it took us to 2012 to get back to our number of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| Do you think that's a component of, and I think it's probably two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| well, three if you count the Great Recession, but also Internet sales and a lack of inflation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=986)|
| 0:16:36| Both. Listen, we can talk about either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| Internet sales. Amazon does pay some Internet taxes currently in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1004)|
| 0:16:54| How much is it? Nobody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| The state won't really give you a number of what we're getting from that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| I'm afraid you're going to back into a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| Listen, go back to the early 90s when I think Congress at that point said no taxes on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1027)|
| 0:17:22| Who was buying anything on the Internet? Nobody? 1%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| It changes, and so I think you have to adjust to the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| I do know that the Supreme Court is going to hear a case, I believe, coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| that's going to have a potential impact on Internet sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| You all have heard the numbers about how it affects the state and what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| There is truth to the fact that it would be hard to try to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| There's 9,000 different tax codes across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| How do you do that? There's a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| If we as a country, and I'll just make this very broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| if we are okay with not taxing the Internet, if we're okay with not paying sales tax on Internet sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1089)|
| 0:18:23| then you will see sales tax revenue at a local level decline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| because the more and more people buy on the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| and if we continue not to charge that sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| then the fewer people will go to malls or they'll go to Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| You can go on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| If you're going to continue to buy online and those numbers don't include sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| that is a lost revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Likewise, you can look at it even more and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| if that continues to happen and people don't go to malls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| then you could also see malls closing up and then you not only lose sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| you lose property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| I think the potential impact of sales tax on local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| the problem is we are very reliant as the state of Tennessee on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| Unless it gets addressed, I think you're going to continue to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| I forget what the number was this past year that we lose as a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| Around $300 million, I think, is the number we were given by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| $300 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| Now, does that mean that's going to be true revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| No, they may not spend some somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| There's probably a number there in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| but I think there's no doubt that Internet sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| eventually one day has to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| We have to decide as a country, do we want to tax it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| If not, are we okay with the consequences of not taxing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| Your other question was inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| As inflation has been very flat, then that has an impact too, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| It's just basic economic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Hey, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| If you could go to page 48,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| and it's all the capital, and then early, the 48 and 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1221)|
| 0:20:29| Is all of that borrowed money when it's inverted capital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| 48 and 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Yeah, CMAQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| I mean, $100,000 here and $100,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Is all that borrowed money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| or do we set aside some surplus to keep from borrowing some of that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| It is all bond dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| I will tell you, going to page 50, we do that as what we call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| we used to do capital notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| but we now just roll it into our bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| but pay it off in five years, and so we pay it off short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| And we may do some of that on page 48 as well, and some of them small numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| I think what you may see us do as well, as we get money from the IMPROVE Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| things like this you may stop seeing in the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| and just start seeing it in operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| That IMPROVE Act will allow us to change some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| that you may be used to seeing in capital more along the operational side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| Yeah, and some of the, on page 49, the school's capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| the modular classroom relocation and environmental testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| and related remediation technology upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| I mean those are smaller amounts that could be taken out of surplus instead of borrowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| because technology upgrades are not going to last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| A lot of things, and what we try to do is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| and so I'm going to bore you once again with accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| so just bear with me, I'm an accountant by nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| So here's what we do, and these two will understand this behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| so they won't be shaking their heads yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| What we prefer to see is a fund be self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| So if Engineering and Public Works has a fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| yeah, we could take surplus from the general fund to supplant it, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| but what can we do to get that fund to where it's self-sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| It's along the same lines of general purpose school fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| Is the revenue there to support it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| So while we can do some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| you will see that we will bring you a list of designations each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| and they're mainly by fund because we want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| okay, if that fund can't support its goals and missions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| then what are we doing wrong and what do we need to do to address it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| But the Improve Act will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| I think once the Improve Act goes in place and it's going in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| I think you will see Dwight and me sit down and we start saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| okay, what are some things that we can change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| We know it's supposed to go for paving, and that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| and that money can't go for paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| but maybe it's the county side we can pull and we can look at CMAQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| geometric improvements, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| I just hate to borrow money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Small money like that won't work for a five- or even a 20-year note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| It's not going to be around in five or 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| CMAQ disappears as soon as you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| It's one of those things that you try to get to a point to where you take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| I think Improve Act can get you to that point for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Chris, our MOU with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| it goes with operating budget through what year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| 2035?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| That MOU was, I think, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| Is that right, Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| A couple more years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Two more years in operating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Beyond 18, so 19 and 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Okay, and the capital plan went for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| It was the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| So to 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| I was kind of curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| the 21-22 capital plan shows no spending for schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Well, they don't need anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| I don't want to speak for Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Basically, I think they decided to wait for the next superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| and look at it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| I may say that this needs to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Chris, on the capital outlay detail report on page 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| does the portable digital radios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| does that show the discount that we received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Is that the net amount listed there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| Yes, that is the net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| And then what we would do, you can see that note on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Once that's approved, we're going to move that back to Chaud Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| and then it's a wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| And then under the public libraries, the third one down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| it says an automatic door for $49,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Is that door singular or door plural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| Because I would hate to think we're spending $49,000 for a single door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1525)|
| 0:25:45| It is doors and plural, and there are some other things in there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| and it's for Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Well, that's good with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| No, I mean, I was just like, okay, $49,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| You can take it out if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| And then I noticed the James White folks had asked for budget dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1562)|
| 0:26:13| to go towards renovations for their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Was that considered at all, or was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| I never saw anything from James White,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| but they are in the defined service contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| and those were done a year ago, and those are set for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| So they never sent an additional request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| I didn't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| And if they would have, it wouldn't matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| because defined service contracts are set for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| If they didn't get it in it last year, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| We only look at them every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Chris, on the capital plan, I see Chaudreau Phase 3 and Phase 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| I believe Phase 1 was the westward direction from Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| Phase 2 is coming back eastward from Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1621)|

| 0:29:14| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| You do realize, along with the honor of leading the Pledge of Allegiance, that in this, the ninth month of commission, on all roll call votes, you will be called on first to cast the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1755)|
| 0:29:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| Let's do it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| We're going to have two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| One is to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| The other will be to set the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| This first motion will cover all the withdrawals, adds, deferreds, and I list them that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| For withdrawals, your item number 19, 20, 21, and 38 are withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1796)|
| 0:30:08| Are there other items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| 19, 20, 21, 38 have been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1813)|
| 0:30:26| Are there any to be deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| I would like to defer item 65, a discussion regarding tourism and sports, to the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1833)|
| 0:30:42| 65, discussion regarding tourism and sports, is deferred to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1842)|
| 0:30:55| Like next Monday or next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| The next work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1858)|

| 0:31:15| Adds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Items to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| I believe 61 is the only one in the handout which is an add that we have before us in print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| 61 is an add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1888)|
| 0:31:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Excuse me, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Next week, I'm sorry, during the presentation of the Carnes Lions Club all-inclusive playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1903)|
| 0:31:52| they presented us with a plaque, so if you'll give me a few minutes at the beginning of next week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| This will be a presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| It's pending, but they can show up and I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Mr. Caldwell, you are more, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| Mr. Snowden, he sacrificed you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| On item 46, resolution 407, we've recently completed some negotiations with CDM Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| for the development of the Chaud Roads contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| I think Jill has handed out that, but the blank should read $482,900 for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| so I just wanted to advise of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| And be prepared to substantiate that figure and contribute significantly later on in the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| because item 46, that will be one that we will have for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| Mine is just a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| We worked with Jill this afternoon about changing the budget resolution to amending that we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1981)|
| 0:33:10| during the meeting, so you will get an amended resolution 801 before Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=1990)|
| 0:33:23| You said 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| 54 is also one that we will have for discussion later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2009)|
| 0:33:43| Are there other adds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Yes, I have two items I'd like to have some discussion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| One is item number nine, and the other is item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| We'll do that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Sir Charles, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2040)|
| 0:34:07| I want to add an item for discussion to just read a little article about three ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| and how it affects the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Add a discussion item on three ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| Are there any other withdrawals, adds, or defers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| I have a motion that the motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2076)|

| 0:34:45| We are now into the discussion items for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| I have a rather long list that may ultimately have no discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| but if you would, as you look at your paperwork there before you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| if there be any discussion on other items, remember your items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| but item 37, we'll discuss these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| Item 37, 39, 45, 46,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2119)|
| 0:35:37| 454, 55, 56, 57, no bingo yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2137)|
| 0:36:05| Almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| 58, 59, and 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2167)|
| 0:36:18| Are there other items that my fellow commissioners wish to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2178)|
| 0:36:27| That's a long list, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| I've got two items that should take literally about a minute each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| I just want to get some additional information that's not included in our package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| Which numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2196)|

| 0:36:43| Nine is added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2203)|
| 0:36:54| Any other items for discussion at the meeting this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| As I said earlier, there may be no discussion on these items as we move through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| If not, these items are not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Do I hear a motion that the consent calendar be set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2235)|

| 0:37:25| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Motion is properly before us to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2259)|

| 0:37:56| for the provision of breakfast, box, lunches, and snacks by the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| for the summer feeding program with service beginning on or about May 30, 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| and continuing for approximately 43 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2292)|

| 0:38:21| Frankly, I was just curious on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| How many total children are we serving through this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I know how important it is, and it's a shame that we have to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| but how many total kids are we helping through this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| That information I'm going to have to get for you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| I'm not sure about the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| It's a routine contract we do every summer, but I'll get you a number on meals served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| I'm more curious about how many total children, not just meals served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| Any other questions or discussion on Item 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| Motion is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Excuse me, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| I think this question is related to how many meals served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| and is it just at that one location, which is CAC, or is it throughout the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| I believe there's several, but let me get that information for you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| We'll make sure you get it before next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Ms. Massey may have more information on it, so here's Ms. Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2365)|
| 0:39:33| Ms. Gill, they provide lunches and the snacks at Fort Sanders and CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| for our extended school year program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| and it's going to be probably about 50 to 60 kids in answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2388)|
| 0:40:01| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| Motion was unanimously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Madam Clerk, the next item, 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| It's listed on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| It's a Resolution 229,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| approving a contract with IC System, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| for the revision of collection services for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| Mr. Thomas, looking at this Item 37,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| schools collection service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Three sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| As you know, when meals are charged and parents do not pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| then the general purpose budget has to absorb that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| So this is a collection agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| It will be about the fourth or fifth steps in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| before we notify the collection agency and turn it over to them for collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| Those are appropriate three sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| And listening to the actions at the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| I wanted to make sure that my fellow commissioners heard those three sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Bob, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| What's the outstanding balance, you think, on all those lunches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| What would you ballpark it at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Gary's got that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| We've had to absorb it the last couple, two or three years in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Gary's got the exact amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| We budget for around $150,000 every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| So that's what's outstanding now, probably $150,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Probably, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| And are you saying that you absorb it if you don't collect it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| By law, we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| So you can't carry it over, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| Like you're not carrying it over and trying to collect it in five years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| No, we have to absorb it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| They continue to try to collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Right, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| But the school, as far as their budget's concerned, it's done after one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| It's out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| So $150,000 is about what it is every year, or that's what it is this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| or that's just the amount that's budgeted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| That's what's budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| but it's trending to be around that number every year now in the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| Now Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| Gary, I know in the school system there are certain classroom fees that you have to waive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| but will this also extend to the non-core fees that are charged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| possibly like driver's ed and athletics that you have problems collecting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| We've determined that the driver's ed fee is not one that we can force collection on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| because it's a graded class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| So we have to waive those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| Now, athletic fees are a different story since that's an extracurricular activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| It's not a graded class fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| So we don't have to waive those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| It's an interesting amount, $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Does it tend to be higher in elementary, middle, or high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| Where is the cost associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| As all of you know, Russ Oaks is on leave at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| All of this is in Russ's head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| But I will tell you that the situation that we've, in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| the situation we have where there are a lot of delinquencies is typically a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| where one child in the family is going to what's called a CEP school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| And that is everybody eats free at a CEP school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| The federal government pays for those meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| And they may have a second child that does not go to a CEP school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| So the family says, well, I'm not having to pay it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Why am I having to pay it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| So they just don't pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| But I've not seen any statistics that say that these delinquencies are tied to poverty or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| I think this is just widespread throughout the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| Seeing no further discussion, I must apologize for not having a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Motion carried unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Item number 39, resolution 301, is approving a contract with Helen Ross McNabb Center, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| for employee psychological services for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Commissioner Nystrom, this is also one that I wanted to make sure that we understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| So I appreciate you also then raising the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Just one timing question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| The first thing when I saw this, I realized we recently approved the behavioral safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| And I know part of that involved training of Knox County Sheriff's officers on that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| So when I first read this, I was curious if that may have been related to training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| or if this is actually for mental health services for all the stress that our officers go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| So if you could kind of clarify that, what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Could I have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Allison Rogers, 400 Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| This contract is mainly for our psychological services for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| When we offer them employment, Helen Ross McNabb will do the psychologicals to show that they are fit for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2751)|
| 0:45:59| They're given 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Helen Ross McNabb is given 10 days once we give them the offer of employment to do the psychologicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| And then, of course, if they pass, they will be an employee of the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| So to clarify, this is not necessarily mental health treatment ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| It's more of a screening to make sure that you're qualified to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Cool. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Is there fit for service for employees that are in service in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| There's also a fitness for duty if there's an incident and the officer needs to be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| There's also a fitness of duty clause in here that Helen Ross McNabb will come in and also do that evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| And I thank you for your three sentences because you have pointed out to us this is for the employee not to train the employee how to evaluate others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2799)|
| 0:46:50| That's the point I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2813)|
| 0:47:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2828)|

| 0:47:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Seeing no further discussion, is there someone here that can speak to this as the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| Is this the last section of the highway leaving Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2860)|
| 0:47:50| Hello, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Yeah, it's from the red light at Hendren Chapel to just near Bower Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| It's that four lane section and this agreement will make it a five lane section to create that center turn lane for all those businesses and residents that live in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2877)|
| 0:48:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| This is not the last section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| How many other segments are there between this segment and the county line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| There is one more project that TDOT has on the books that will go from Highland View to the gap in the mountain, which will put a five lane section and realign Sevierville Pike and I can't remember the name of the road down at the cemetery, but they do have one more project towards the county line that will involve a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2894)|
| 0:48:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| I just wanted the commission and those watching at home on TV to make sure that everyone is aware of work taking place on that stretch of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| I do believe, Mr. Snowden, that we got to go from Mountain Grove to Hendren Chapel also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| That's just a four lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| That's not been let yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| So there's two more sections really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2939)|

| 0:49:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2984)|

| 0:49:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| I know that from Western Avenue-Oak Ridge Highway heading east, it's a city road until you get to the city golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| Is this a joint project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| How are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| It's totally county funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| So it will be Knox County being the project manager on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| Why is the city not participating in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| You know, I don't know if I can really answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| I'm not real sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| They haven't expressed a lot of interest in it like we have, and we just think that the project is necessary, so we would like to pursue it regardless of their interest or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3016)|
| 0:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| I agree it is a very worthy, needed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| I'm a bit concerned that they're not chipping in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| The intersection, do they just have the road or do they have any of the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| No, it's just finger annexation on the roadway up to the municipal golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| I believe it's just probably less than 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| It's already two lane there, four lane all the way up, about 1,000 feet short of the golf course, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3052)|
| 0:51:00| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3060)|

| 0:52:41| A county tax rate of $2.32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| And that is, I see that to be the correct amount, $2.32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3168)|
| 0:52:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3177)|

| 0:53:12| Budget's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| Will that rate take into effect the 2017 fiscal year OTA refunds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| So, basically, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| So, what we'll do is estimate growth and then we'll take into account what OTAs were there for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| And the new rate will be probably somewhere, say, $208 to $210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| Depending on the tax rate, we'll jump from $1104 currently to $11 something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3217)|

| 0:59:05| I don't think there's any question that I can put them up against any clerks anywhere, anytime in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| Having said that, on behalf of the best clerks on the planet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| we are pleased to present to you, to Mayor Burchett and the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3556)|

| 0:59:32| Does anyone have any questions of Mr. Hammond while we have his undivided attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3572)|
| 0:59:44| Seeing no further discussion of the presentation of this check, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3584)|
| 0:59:55| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| Item number 66, discussion regarding the Knox County Commission Committee's terms of membership of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3602)|
| 1:00:11| That was a discussion item brought from last month, terms of membership of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you and I have not talked about it, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| I believe that the Law Department has prepared paperwork related to the terms of membership of commissioners for Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3624)|
| 1:00:38| Of all members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Well, the question was brought before this body a month ago, and we looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| and here is where the situation needs to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| The Audit Committee has a charter within itself, of which it has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3652)|
| 1:00:59| they're trying to address the vacancies of commissioners when they leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| and the way the charter reads, it leaves these vacancies to be filled, and that's a partial term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| instead of being a full term for a commissioner once appointed, so their terms could coincide with a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3670)|
| 1:01:19| We have some proposed language for three or four different policy approaches to that solution, or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3679)|
| 1:01:28| that we will be glad to bring to the Audit Committee so that they can make a recommendation to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3688)|
| 1:01:36| as to how their charter might be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| and then you all can address those issues and discuss except or not at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| the proper way would be to let the Audit Committee debate the issues for their charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3706)|
| 1:01:54| and then submit it to this board to be approved and or amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| so that's the recommendation to the Law Director is to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| We'll give those, we'll give several different approaches to it to that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| and those approaches also would come up to this body at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| So, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| So, in other words, it's the opinion of the Law Director's Office that if a commissioner filled in for a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3741)|
| 1:02:30| that didn't fill the full four-year term, that that starts at the beginning of their four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3750)|
| 1:02:42| When a vacancy occurs, those appointed are filling the vacancy of their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| Okay, till that point on the September 1st when we make the new appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Okay, that was the point I was making, so that those like Mr. Nystrom and myself who were appointed on September 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3775)|
| 1:03:03| we should be set to serve a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| If reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| If reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Right now, I think it's Commissioner Broyles and Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| The two vacancies that were filled by the two current commissioners discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| Those terms expire on August 31st of 2018, at which time the board is reappointed under the current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3802)|
| 1:03:35| That time, if so appointed, you would be going to the remainder of your term unless this charter is changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3815)|
| 1:03:43| That's the way the charter addresses the issue, and what some of the examples we have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| is that once a commissioner is appointed, it will be for that appointed commissioner's term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| and we would separate the term limits from the citizen members and the commission members as an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| But the way we currently have it, the way the charter currently reads, that's what we have to do until the charter's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3841)|
| 1:04:10| So I think the audit committee, the way it was originally set up, we were trying to get, well, it all expires at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3850)|
| 1:04:20| where you have commissioners that don't expire at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| So you could always end up with a two-year term or a four-year term, depending who this body appoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| You could actually have a commissioner coming up, and they would expire in two years because their term would expire in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| so it would be for the commissioner's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| It doesn't mean a two-year term or a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| It only means who's appointed and how much term they have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| But under the current one, everybody expires at the same date, and a partial term expires with that date, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3888)|
| 1:04:57| And then this body will reappoint for the next term, and that's a two-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| Now it's a four-year term, but it could end up being only two years for whoever's appointed, and it'll create a vacancy the way it's written now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3904)|
| 1:05:12| So you all on the audit committee need to try to address this through your charter change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| and we'll be able to try to help guide that and then bring it before this body to be voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| and eliminate this problem if that's the will of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| Seeing no further discussion, the next discussion item is on Three Ridges Golf Course, Commissioner Sir Charles Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3934)|
| 1:05:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| Sometimes you really don't know what you have until somebody else sees it through somebody else's eyes that are experts in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3947)|
| 1:05:55| And I've got a note here from, it came by way of an e-mail from Ron Witten, Senior Editor Architect of Golf Digest Magazine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3955)|
| 1:06:10| There were three courses in the area that he came by to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| One was at Tokwa, which is in Loudoun County, and he gives you some information on the information I set out to all of you to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3976)|
| 1:06:27| And if you'll notice in the second opinion he talks about, this is my second favorite, talking about Tokwa, and he mentions just a couple of holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3987)|
| 1:06:38| Then he talks about Links at Kahiti, which is the third favorite of this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| He says, I suspect that this is the one that you want me to take a look at to go in for the running of the top 100 courses in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4003)|
| 1:06:53| And then he talks about Tenassee and gives a couple of holes, if he likes, on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4013)|
| 1:07:01| I want to read to you what he says about this course, Three Ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| And he says, of this year's courses, I suspect you want my critique on each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4029)|
| 1:07:18| And he's going to give his information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| He says, Three Ridges was my first, and most always says, Three Ridges was my favorite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4040)|
| 1:07:28| A surprise, I'm sure, especially given how poorly he played on that course that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| But architecturally, I thought it contained absolutely the best set of holes we played this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4054)|
| 1:07:43| I love the stretch from 8 through 11 and 13 through 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| In fact, there wasn't a weak hole out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| And while holes like 7 and 12 could have benefited with a bit more definition via bunkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| they did add contrast to the heavily bunkered and nicely bunkered 4, 6, and 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| Look how many holes this person mentioned at Three Ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| which means it left a lasting memory in his mind when he was writing his review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4089)|
| 1:08:17| He said, not a bad hole on the course, best ambience of any venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| with spectacular views of the mountains, hence the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4103)|
| 1:08:31| If this course had been maintained, maintenance had been provided like they had at Tenassee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4111)|
| 1:08:40| it would have been a contender to our top 100 public, I kid you not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4120)|
| 1:08:49| Alas, it's a public course maintained in public fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| I'm curious what sort of shape it was in for the old web.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| Now, let me give you one other piece of information about this course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| When this person played this course, it was after two days of tournament and rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| So it still made an impression on this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| So we have that type of recognition from a public course maintained by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| And really, from a very articulate, which I wish I could have read it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| but about his course, about this course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170515?start=4169)|
