| 0:07:27| like to thank each and every one of you for another year. Okay the next order of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=447)|
| 0:07:36| is item number three. Receive and consideration of the Knox County Internet Auditor's travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| allowance report and possible actions. So Mr. Richard Walls if you want to lead us through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| this. First off I'd like to thank my staff, Wanda and Shane, the Tennessee Comptroller's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=468)|
| 0:08:02| Office, the Law Department, County Commission, Mayor's Office and Finance Department, HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| that all contributed to our work while we were doing the review. You received the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| and also in your packet there was a schedule of the status of the different audits that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| we're working on and there's also what you might call a cliff notes version of the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| that does a summary of the findings and recommendations and you may want to refer to that in parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=512)|
| 0:08:40| with the report as we're discussing it. First we want to talk a little bit about the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| and how we are here today and what we've done. While we were reviewing payroll information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| that was reported to the Commission Office during the budget review we noted an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| noted called auto allowance and as a result of that we asked the payroll department for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=543)|
| 0:09:12| a listing of those with auto allowances and also a vehicle listing from the Fleet Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| Division. While reviewing this information we noted certain people that had county vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=559)|
| 0:09:28| and also were receiving an auto allowance. This led to a line of questions during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| budget hearings that as a result has led to the work we've done. If you want to now refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| to the report we'll look at finding number one and if you notice each finding the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=582)|
| 0:09:52| it's structured we discuss the issue, we make recommendations, then you'll see the response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=592)|
| 0:10:00| from the Mayor's Office and if needed there's also a rebuttal. If you want to go ahead we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| start with number one, salary. That is actually finding number one on page three. Like I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=607)|
| 0:10:22| you can also follow along on the summary version there too that has it in a nutshell. Finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| one is salary improperly reported as travel, miscellaneous reimbursement. When we first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| started looking at the auto allowance and questioned it, it was described to us as unreimbursed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| travel expenses. Later we were told it was actually a salary supplement. So based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=642)|
| 0:10:54| that information the issues we have listed is that the salary was improperly reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=654)|
| 0:11:02| as a travel miscellaneous reimbursement in the account auto allowance. Second, the salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=662)|
| 0:11:12| did not conform to amounts the Commission approved in the budget. This is not in accordance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=672)|
| 0:11:23| with section 2-553 of the Knox County Code where the finance department lists each salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=683)|
| 0:11:31| employee in each department with the salary amounts. What happened here is they were actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| not paid based on the information you were given. The third item in that area refers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=699)|
| 0:11:48| to section 2-2 of the Knox County Code where an elected official cannot receive a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| and an allowance. Based on these issues and findings our recommendation is to refer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| to the Knox County Law Director for an opinion and whether or not restitution should be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| and secondly refer the above matters to the Knox County Ethics Committee. I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| if the Mayor's Office wants to discuss the response. I would just like to add that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| Mayor's Office has a written response that we are happy to discuss if you have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| and we concur that our next step would be to request the Law Director to take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| at this. Commissioner Trammell? Thanks. What I would like to say is that this is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=757)|
| 0:12:47| payments through payroll on this. Accounted for is auto travel allowances in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=767)|
| 0:13:00| Yes I think that was an inaccurate description and I think Dwight Vandeveidt's memo addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| several of these except for the Mayor's. Was this an error? I think it's a bad description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| yes. Were the salary amounts, were they set forth in the schedule in the budget as salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=794)|
| 0:13:29| when it was presented to commission? For these salary items? You're talking about the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=809)|
| 0:13:44| supplements? No they were not. Commissioner Pinkston? John, on this travel allowance here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=824)|
| 0:13:57| now, let's get one thing straight. The Mayor said that every other executive had had this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| expense account, is that correct? I believe you said that. The two previous county executives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| yes sir. Well, why did he have a credit card? A credit card is a different decision. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=850)|
| 0:14:21| but why did he have it? It was used for expenses. Yes sir it was. So he's really got two expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| accounts. Well the credit card would still be charged against the budget and the expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| allowance would be charged against the budget. I mean that's two different methodologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| to charge against the budget. Yes sir. All right, we've raised his salary from $140,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| it looks like and he had an $86,000 expense account. He only used $9,559 of that. So in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=884)|
| 0:14:58| other words he had a salary supplement which he took home of $76,441. Now when you give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| somebody an expense account in the private sector, I understand that that's to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| their expenses. If they don't use it, they don't get to stick it in their pocket. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| that not true? Now you've been in the private sector, I'm sure. Well the IRS offers two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| different methodologies to use. You can either have the accountable plan or the non-accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| plan and what we have with the Mayor is that he started out with the intent for an accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| plan and during the process changed to the non-accountable plan and so that the expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| that he had were also documented. Some were documented with the county and some were documented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| on his tax return. Well we set his salary at $140,000 a year for the physical year of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| 2007. He's making more money when he takes this money and puts it in his pocket. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=955)|
| 0:16:04| I don't know how you, in county government that might be called misappropriation of funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=964)|
| 0:16:13| but in the private sector I believe they would call that stealing. That may be a little strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| to use, but I don't know. When you take something that isn't yours and you haven't obtained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| legally, I don't know, I'm no lawyer, but it looks to me like that's fraud or stealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| or something. Well Commissioner, the amount is there. The amount has been the same for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| four years. This is the fourth year of the same amount. It may have, but it was hidden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| in our budget. We set his salary for $140,000 in the physical year of 2007. Now I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| know. He sure made a lot more money than that, hadn't he? He took it home with him, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| put it that way. Is that not correct? If you take it home with you, you made it. So in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| other words, to me, he's taken this money illegally or through a disguised compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1023)|
| 0:17:11| one way or the other. There's no way about it. You can put it in any ledger you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| to and move it over, anything you want to, but he took this money home with him without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| the permission of County Commission and the taxpayers of Knoxville, Tennessee. I'd just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| like to say that the two previous county executives did have an expense allowance and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| the same amount for the last four years. Well if he had this expense allowance, he had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| credit card too then. That's true. Well, it just doesn't sound kosher to me at all. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1057)|
| 0:17:45| think we've been suckered. People don't realize it. Now I want to ask you one other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| here. You are the comptroller now and you've got a hard job. I want the people of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| County to know that all these other departments did not have these credit cards like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| Is that not true? Credit cards, how do you mean? Well, let's just say the highway department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| and county commission or any office, the only thing we can use those for, they're designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| to what we can use them for for supplies and things like that where we have to spend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| Is that correct? All the credit cards in all offices are limited now, yes. Now, now, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| we're talking about now, but before they weren't. That's true. These other, we keep talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| about PR cards, this spend at Dwight Vanderbate, which we're paying a guy about approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| $140,000 a year to just spend the truth. These other people and these other departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| I've checked them all, and they had PR cards where they're designated only to be used at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| certain places, but in the mayor's office and his staff, they took these credit cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| before they could use them for anything they wanted to. Is that not correct? Food, lodging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| fly to Hiawahia, do anything they want to. Is that not correct? The restrictions on food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| and travel were not in place in the mayor's office. And nobody else had those kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| cards, did they? That's true. All right, I just want the public to know that. We can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| get it out in the paper, apparently, but they keep talking about how many they've pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| Who has these credit cards now, these open-end credit cards like that in the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| No one has the open-ended, no one has the travel or the food allowed on their credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| cards now, and not even the mayor. Okay. You know, John, I find it hard to believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| the salary that these people are making, that they should even have to have a travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| allowance or anything like that. You know, when you go to Nashville here, it's 200 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| from here, the cost of living is 27.5% higher than it is in Knox County. Now, you realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| that if you live in Nashville, to live like someone does in Knoxville, you've got to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| $127.50 where here in Knox County they only have to make $100. These people are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| more, and I'm talking about the chief of staff and everything, than the mayor of Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| Now, these salaries, they've been blowed up without county commission's approval and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| else, and these jobs that have been created. Let me ask you, you've been here, you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| here before this mayor came here, I believe you were comptroller then, weren't you? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| was deputy director of finance, yes. All right, sir. Let me ask you this, how many new jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| have been created at these outrageous amounts under this administration? Well, we never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| had a chief of staff before, did we? That's true. We never had a PR man before, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| There was a PR person. Who was the PR person? Molly. Molly Pratt, was she not also the lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| Yes, she was. All right, she held two jobs with one salary. What we've done is created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| Now you can stand up here and talk about all these jobs that you've made government smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| but you're the comptroller, a large percentage of those jobs come when the county got rid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| of John Tarleton, were they not? That's included in some of the numbers. That's right, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| where the large majority of these jobs come from. Now, we eliminated some people working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| up here in this county that made very minimal wages, but we created positions that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| took the wages of five or six of those people that we let go with these absorbent salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| Our government has been running wild, and we're trying to take charge of it, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| getting flack from everybody, from the paper and everybody out here, but right now this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| county commission is the only safeguard that we have against, I would say, sort of a form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| of a dictatorship. Now, when somebody can take and override every rule and safeguard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| that we put in effect up here, you've got to say that they've got either a disrespect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| for the law, the rules, or they want to be a dictator. Now, I may be coming a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| hard, but we've got Mike Arms here with the absorbent salary. He gets a $5,000 bonus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| top of that that the people don't know about. Grant DeBate gets two bonuses. Todd Cook gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1325)|
| 0:22:12| two bonuses. Somewhere we've got to stop this, and I don't know any way to do it. We're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| our best to get the district attorney to step in, but these people have been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| things illegally. Now, you are a CPA, and if you were hired by the IRS to go in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| investigate a corporation out here that was in business, these people would be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| at jail time for what they've done. I'm going to make a recommendation right now that every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| one of these people pay back every penny of this travel allowance that they've taken because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| they've taken it illegal. And I hope that somebody here will second that. I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| Okay, we've got a motion to, let me see if I understand this, to ask the five individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1373)|
| 0:23:10| for the county mayor to reimburse Knox County for their car allowance from when they started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1390)|
| 0:23:21| getting it until present. Right, and let me add something to that. And the mayor's be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| completely cut out since he has a credit card. Okay, does the second? I think he's saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1406)|
| 0:23:38| that the mayor is getting $20,000 and now it may be a supplement to his pay, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1418)|
| 0:23:46| county commission by resolution, Mr. Law Director, is that the only way that the mayor can adjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| his salary? Well, his salary is $140,000 and he's still receiving a $20,000 car allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1432)|
| 0:24:02| slash supplement slash travel reimbursement. So Commissioner Pinkston wants to add into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1442)|
| 0:24:12| his motion that we do away with the $20,000 in addition to the mayor's salary where his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1452)|
| 0:24:24| total salary package would be $140,001. Yeah, I'm still not quite sure what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1464)|
| 0:24:33| I mean, according to our Knox County Code, Section 2-2, an elected official may receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1473)|
| 0:24:41| either a vehicle or a travel allowance. Is that where you're going with that? I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1481)|
| 0:24:50| the mayor's got both. He's got the vehicle plus the travel allowance. Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1490)|
| 0:24:59| I'd like to say that the mayor considers this as an expense allowance and not a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| I don't care what the mayor considers it. He's got a credit card. He uses that for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| expense allowance too, doesn't he? He uses it for office expenses, yes. Okay, let's go to Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1512)|
| 0:25:24| Yeah, thank you. The previous executives that received this travel supplement or expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| account, was it $20,000 as well? No. This current year is the fourth year at $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1530)|
| 0:25:39| Previous to that, it was, for this mayor, $16,000. Previous to that, it was $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| The last year of Mr. Shumpert's administration was 12. So 12 and then 16, the first year Mayor Ragsdale came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| and then 20 the second year, and then every year subsequent, right? Yeah, it was 12, 16, and then 20, 20, 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| Was it also listed as an auto allowance on Mr. Shumpert's books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| We have changed systems, and previously it was listed as other per diem and fees. So, not a good description either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1566)|
| 0:26:17| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| You know, Commissioners, I just got this. I just got this for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| Commissioner Pinkerton, you've done a lot of research, and you've got your figures, and I applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| You know, to me, if somebody's guilty, then they're going to be guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| But I don't think we can vote on this. We need to wait for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| We just got in trouble for not listening to the law director before this from another committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| He says he wants to look at this. I want to see what our law director has to say about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| and if he says we need to proceed with it, then I'm for proceeding with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| But for right now, we've got 20 or 30 pages here. I hadn't seen a thing of it until just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| and I won't be able to research this to know what I'm voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| I mean, if somebody's guilty, fine, I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| But don't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Well, I think we as commissioners, we should have just got this just a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| And like I say, Mr. Pinkerton, you've done a lot of research on this, and I know your mind is made up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| but we've just had our law director with the Executive Committee, we got in trouble here because we jumped the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| And I think we may be doing that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| I don't think we jumped the gun at the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| We're trying to get something done for the taxpayers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Well, I understand that. I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Wait a minute. We are citizens just like everybody else on the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| and they have broken every rule, and the people out here are crying for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Well, and read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| But you're wanting to go back and pay the $20,000, so, you know, if it takes 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| Let's stay here tonight. You read this thing, study it, and we'll stay here until something's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| The taxpayers out here want some relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| I want educated relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| Okay, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| You can't understand what you read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| Go to Commissioner Frank Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| The caveat that I'd like to see here is that our law director, who is our legal advisor, would weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1697)|
| 0:28:32| I agree with the motion in the sense that if this is not permitted, it should be paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1712)|
| 0:28:43| But before we declare that, I would like to have it that the law department would review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1723)|
| 0:28:54| and concur that this would be an obligation, that it was improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| Now, in terms of Mayor Ragsdale himself, I helped draft the charter for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1740)|
| 0:29:10| I don't know if that's good news or bad news, but the one thing that's statement in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| and it's kind of come out a little bit, is that the mayor would be the highest paid elected official for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1755)|
| 0:29:25| And I was wondering whether, in fact, all those years, what it would take to make the mayor comply with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1765)|
| 0:29:34| because that would be a dictate, too, from the charter itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| The charter itself would dictate that the salary could not be any less than any other elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1777)|
| 0:29:46| And I don't know if that changes that or not, whether he would need that supplement to get there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| That's a matter of fact, and I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Maybe John Troyer knows that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| That would be in the mayor's case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| It would not be for the other ones if that was a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| But if the law director would concur that these things are not eligible to receive those for anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1805)|
| 0:30:15| then, in fact, that money would be due back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| That's for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Well, I would certainly like to hear from the law department first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| because I concur with the notion that if it was not properly in the budget and properly earned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| and was not allowed, then the only recourse is to have it paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| But I'd certainly like to have the concurrence of the law department before I would vote on such an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| Otherwise, I'm putting myself into that legal position, and I don't want to put myself in that legal position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| even though I agree basically with the intent of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Mr. Law Director, can you bring some light into as far as just the salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| As far as salary, the charter provides that the county mayor is to be the highest paid elected official of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1862)|
| 0:31:13| The charter provides that the county law director's salary is based upon that of the circuit court judges, the courts of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| My salary is the same as that of the circuit court judges, and the mayor makes more than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| So with that said, as far as the $140,001, that would be in compliance with the charter, that specific item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1888)|
| 0:31:43| Could you comment on the rest of the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| What is the rest of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Well, the rest of the question is, have you had enough time to review this and find, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| that it was not properly in the budget and should not properly have been paid according to the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| and recommendations of the audit here, or do you need more time to study or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| Oh, I have said publicly, I haven't said it to each one of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| but I've said publicly that I'm not going to be making any opinions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| I received it in my packet at the same time that each of you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| It's going to take some time to look it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| I see the first and second findings and recommendations include recommending that the law director study it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1941)|
| 0:32:30| and make recommendations, and it's going to take a little while to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| As you know, we have a trial that begins tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| We have jury selection beginning at 9.30, and while I've got you here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| we would like for each one of you to be present at 9.15 tomorrow morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| so we may introduce you to the prospective jurors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| We have a panel of 60 jurors coming in tomorrow morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| that we're going to start questioning at hopefully as close to 9.30 as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| With that said, we want to make sure that whenever we as elected officials and employees of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=1990)|
| 0:33:23| that anyone who is basically related to Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| that we make no contact whatsoever with any prospective juror,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| that we make no contact whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| that we refrain from commenting around anyone in the courthouse that you don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2016)|
| 0:33:48| because it might be perceived, there may be a juror that walks by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| and they may perceive some comment as an attempt to influence them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| and that is the last thing that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| So the court asked today that we talk to our respective clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| They asked the new sentinel to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| They asked Mr. Monsier to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| And so that's what I'm doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| But basically, whenever you're in the courthouse, be very careful of your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| and try not to make any comments at all when there are folks around you that you do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2059)|
| 0:34:28| 9.15 tomorrow morning, that's when we would like for you to be at the second chancellery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| It's Chancellor Fanzler's court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| It's on the first floor of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| Okay, Commissioner Bolus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| I had a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| You were talking about Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| You said, and correct me if I'm wrong, you said Coach Shumpert and Dwight Kessel both received this supplement, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| How much was it at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| The last was $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| How was it listed on theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Other per diem and fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Other per diem and fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| Okay, Commissioner Craig Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| I would like to give the Law Director a chance to read over this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| Commissioner Moore, do we have this item on our agenda for our regular meeting in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we add this to our regular September meeting so that everybody has a chance to study this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2129)|
| 0:35:41| And maybe at that time, Commissioner Pinkston, we'll be all prepared to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| I think we're just talking, we'll have our regular committee meetings a week from today and a regular commission meeting one week after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2146)|
| 0:35:57| So we're talking on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| From what I understand, they're not receiving the tribal allowance now, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| The mayor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| The mayor is still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| And if we decide that he has to reimburse us that money to the county, then that's just that much more he'll have to reimburse us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2170)|
| 0:36:18| But I'd like to put that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Could I read something here just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Yeah, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Seconded by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Okay, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| If everybody will turn to page 6 in this audit, it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| It appears that all the employees are subject to the pay setting scale except Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| According to Section 304 of the Knox County Charter, the commission shall set the mayor's compensation for fiscal year 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2198)|
| 0:36:48| The Knox County Commission set the mayor's salary at $140,001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| By unilaterally increasing salaries through a salary supplement, the uniform pay setting system policy was not followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2215)|
| 0:37:05| and Section 3.04 of the Knox County Charter has been violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| Now, that came from our auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| Now, while we're sitting here now, Mike Arms was running around here a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| I don't know where everybody is, but they may be out here spending the county's money right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| We've walked around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| We've talked around, postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| We can't seem to get anything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| And I still say that we can read the rest of this, but right now we need to vote on this travel allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| and they need to be made to pay it back, and then the law director needs to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| and if they took it illegally, they need to be standing before a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| Now, that's the way I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| I just want to reiterate one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| If our law director is uncomfortable with it, I'm certainly not comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| And like I say, if the man's guilty, I'll be in there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| But if our law director says, no, we want time to look at it, that's what he's paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| Okay, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Did I hear our law director say he was uncomfortable with it or just didn't have a decision right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| I don't think you heard me say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| I believe the law director said his salary was subsided at $140,000 a year, and he's been making quite a bit more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| What we have on the floor right now is a substitute motion to add it to the commission's regular agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2318)|
| 0:38:47| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| How many noes did we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Do we have any on this side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| Just do a roll call because it would be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Is it too late to add a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Commissioner Jordan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Commissioner Bolus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Commissioner Cade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2372)|

| 0:39:45| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Commissioner Huddleston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2393)|

| 0:39:56| Commissioner Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2396)|

| 0:40:00| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Okay, 14 ayes and three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| So this item will be added to our regular scheduled meeting this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Richard was, this is sort of convenient to let Richard talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| If it would be okay with the rest of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| I would like to hear him give the presentation that he was set to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| and maybe help us as we go through this document if that would be acceptable to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| I think what Commissioner Ballard is asking that we let Mr. Wallace finish his presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| and then maybe Mr. John Troyer can respond and then I guess if we have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| we can ask them at the end unless we have objections from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2456)|
| 0:41:04| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| In our charter or in Knox County Code, we have an ability to have subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| This commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| If we're going to look at this thing in our next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| and we're going to ask questions of the people that are involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| I would suggest that each of us look at our charter, our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| It's 2.02H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| Everybody take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| We probably, if we're going to decide something of compensation, possible legal actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| you know, charter violations or oustable offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| we need to be very prepared for what we're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| And keep in mind, commissioners, this is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| There's four more coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| And it's not going to be pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| We've got a tough job, but if we're going to do this, we need to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| We need to follow the rules and the law that's laid out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| So take a look at that in your charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| It's 2.02H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| It gives us the right, with 13 votes, to have subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| And these people can testify under oath, and we can call witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| and maybe get to the bottom of some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Are you putting that forward as a motion right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| I would make that a motion that on the 24th, when we convene to ask questions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| that we do it with subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| Who are you suggesting that we subpoena?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Anybody that we need to talk to about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Anybody that we need to discuss about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| And if we have to do this on the next one, on the procurement cards, if we have to make another motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| I don't know, Mr. Law Director, you can tell me, but I'd like to have this follow through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| until we're finished with these audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| I second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| Okay, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| One thing we've never done is utilize this section of our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| About time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| It requires a supermajority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| It requires 13 members to vote to conduct such an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| So if that's the motion, it takes 13 here in order to entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| Okay, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| 2.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| 2.02?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Letter H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Upon adoption of an approving resolution in each instance by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the entire commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| the commission and its authorized committees shall have full power and authority to hold public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| with power to subpoena witnesses and to administer oaths where necessary or desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| for the purpose of either gathering information necessary or desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| for the purpose of considering proposed commission legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| or two, investigating any alleged violations of this charter ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| or emergency ordinances of the commission brought by either the executive of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| or any other member of the commission against any elected official or employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| No such hearing shall be held with or without such subpoena power having been exercised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| except when a quorum of the commission or any authorized committee as appropriate is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| Okay, and that was seconded by Commissioner Blunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Okay, we've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Let's start, I don't know who had their light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Commissioner Frank Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| Here again, I guess that's a section I helped draft several years ago and it has never been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2683)|
| 0:44:53| I'd like to see added to the motion is that the law department indicate those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| that in fact are in here that are in this report where somebody has to decide who those individuals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2700)|
| 0:45:10| Now, we may know some of them tonight, but if the chair in the law department could decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| who those individuals are, then they could be issued those ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| Somebody needs to decide who those individuals are and serve them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| and if we're going to subpoena them, add our meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| If I may, Mr. Lutho, that's great, but I don't think that you could narrow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| When you're doing an investigation, and I have a little bit of experience with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| but when you're doing an investigation, you don't know where it's going to lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| So I would like to retain the right to call anybody we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| and then administer an oath and if they choose to answer our questions or take the fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| or whatever they want to do, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| Does that make sense to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| Hold on, I was distracted. Say it again, Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| I'd like to retain the right to call anybody we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| You know, what we're doing here is an investigation of charter violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| We're going to have questions. Mr. Troyer's name is not mentioned in any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| He owes no money. We suspect he owes no money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| But we may want to question Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| So Mr. Troyer still needs to be questioned under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| I think the law director needs to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| We issue the subpoenas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Would we not issue them through the law director's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Probably come to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| Are you looking to me for an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Yes. We can retain the right to call anybody we wish during this investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| Under 2.02H, it is very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| It is somewhat scant in its direction to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| Like I say, this has never been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| But upon adoption of an approving resolution in each instance by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the entire commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2828)|
| 0:47:18| the commission and its authorized committee shall have full power and authority to hold public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| with power to subpoena witnesses and to administer oaths where necessary or desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| for the purpose of either gathering information necessary or desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| for the purpose of considering proposed commission legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| or investigating any allegation of violations of this charter ordinances or emergency ordinances of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| No such hearing shall be held with or without such subpoena power having been exercised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| except when a quorum of the commission or any authorized committee as appropriate is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| That's all it gives us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| The way I read that, each instance, what I really wanted to do was hold it open for anything that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| through the rest of our audits, but each audit we have, we're going to have to come back and do a two-thirds vote the way I read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| Or can we do them all at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| I think you need to have a clearly defined purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| I think we do on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| We have a defined purpose to put this audit behind us and then move to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| And let's take them one at a time as they come, do what we need to do on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| close the book on it, refer it to where it needs to be referred, and then wait on the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| I think if you pull five audits and you wait until they're all finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| and try to do them all at once and wrap it in one big package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| it's going to be a mess and nobody's going to understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| What concerns me if we do this, I mean the law director just told us, you know, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| we've got a major couple of weeks in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| I don't see how the law director is going to be able even to have his information ready for us even next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| And if we go out and subpoena these people, which that's okay, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| And if we're not ready, I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| You know, Mr. Chairman, I'd rather you all have an open door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| Mr. Chairman, you work with the mayor and anybody that needs to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| You know, ladies and gentlemen, this is a dark hour for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| We have never, ever done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Oh, I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| We've never subpoenaed anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| Haven't we, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| We're making this better, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| This is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| We're getting through the tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| I understand, but they're going nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| They're going nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| If we want them here, then they'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Listen, this is what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| This is what you need to study before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| I just got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Your questions will be right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| I'm not for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Come out of this the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| That's what you've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| This is why we need to do this one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| And I don't mind doing that, but I still want to follow the lead of our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| and let him get together with the finance people and tell us what's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| We know what's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| It's in your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| No, it's right here in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| It's spelled out what you can and you can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| We follow these every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Well, the law director's not ready to move with it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| How come you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| He didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| He didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Yes, he did, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Gentlemen, what we've got here...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| It looks like we're going to court, so let's subpoena other people and let's have them go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| No, this is cleaning up a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| We didn't create it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| They'll clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| This is our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| They're going nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| It's apparent some of these people want to wait until 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| Let's get back to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| The thing that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| I would be in favor of this just for one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| We've had a couple of meetings and no one shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| We're wasting 19 people's time here tonight when we have nobody from this administration here except Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| And I appreciate Mr. Troyer being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| But when we have to ask a question, we need it to come from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| I mean, you can't really answer for Mr. Ragsdale or Mr. Arms or Mr. Vandervelde or Mr. Cook or Mr. Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3075)|
| 0:51:23| I mean, you can answer for it, but tomorrow they can say, well, John didn't really know what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| And then here we are two or three weeks down the road before we see each other again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| And we need to get to the bottom of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| I mean, I think that's all we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| And if we don't have all the players here, it's like playing a game of checkers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| and you're missing half the checkers when you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| You don't have enough to play the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| So I'll end my comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Larry, nobody is saying that we convict anybody of anything today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| What Mr. Trimble is suggesting is that we use our legitimate subpoena power to investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| to bring these folks in, to question them under oath and investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| You know, I think it's a sad situation in that you don't trust this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| If they say they're going to have their people here, then they're going to have their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| And you all can laugh about it, but then that shows that we're not getting along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| We're not getting along with each other then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| How many different scenarios did we get for this pay, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| How many different stories did this commission receive from the administration about what this pay was going for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| I am not an accountant, and you can twist it a bunch of different ways how you want to say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| and Mr. Troy can come up with some other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| That's what this is for, gather information necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| Investigating alleged violations of the charter, that's what this section is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| We need to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| I think when we get ready to vote, people know, I think you know how you're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| So, I mean, there are going to be some people opposed and some people for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| so we don't need to air it out here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| I can't talk to him in private about it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| I mean, I don't think you're all going to agree anyway, so it probably don't matter if you talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| I think I still have the floor, but the people's trust in Knox County government has been shaken lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| And time after time again, we get scandal after scandal after scandal about the taxpayers' money being misappropriated and misspent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3205)|
| 0:53:34| And I think that we need to send a strong message to the taxpayers tonight that we are going to look after their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3214)|
| 0:53:42| If you look at some of these, take the mayor's travel supplement, $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| I have a lot of folks that live in my district that are struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| and that are working hard to pay their property taxes and to pay their wheel taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| and they don't even make a total of $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Now, for those folks that are sitting at home, I think we need to send them a strong message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| that we're not going to sweep this under the rug, that we are going to stand up and we are going to do our job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| and we are going to investigate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| And that's why I'm supporting Mr. Tremble's motion, and I hope that the rest of you all will as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| I think it's absolutely the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| All it is about is seeking the truth, and the truth will set us free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| Okay, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| I think one of the primary purposes of this meeting was to hear the report of Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| And I hope and I would consider that his report is part of this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3278)|
| 0:54:46| And I would hope we could get on with that, hear his report, hear his discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| and simultaneously in the process of this thing that's been going on for the last 20 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| the law director has expressed that he would like to have time to digest this and make suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3299)|
| 0:55:08| I think to go faster than that is going to invite trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| I see that a lot of people already, and with all due respect to members of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| you've already got your minds made up about what needs to be done and how it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| But I think we really would be well served to hear from Mr. Walls and to hear from our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3324)|
| 0:55:33| Okay, we've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| We've got two more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Commissioner Luthold and then Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| I guess my question is to the law director about due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| And I guess Mr. Trammell's motion is to have this on the September 24th during a regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3344)|
| 0:55:55| Is that when you're suggesting that we hold this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| No, that was your motion, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| No, no, that's to add this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| I'm talking about his motion to use subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| Were you suggesting that we use that on the 24th or a later date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| If it's on the agenda the 24th, we need to have subpoena power to question witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| Then my question is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Is that enough time to give these people, I mean, they're going to be under oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| and there's such a thing as due process, and I assume they're going to be hiring attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| I think some of them already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| Is that enough time for them to come in, be prepared to be sworn under oath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| Or are they going to be able to come in and stall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| I'm just concerned about the process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| What we need to know is from this body you need to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| and let us know who it is that you wish to have subpoenaed for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| First and foremost, you need to vote that what you're going to do is conduct a 2.02H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| That takes two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Then you can get into the subpoena information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| But that's how I see that it really ought to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| First vote on whether you wish to proceed with a 2.02H investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| and then you need to get into the brass tacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| and see who it is that you wish to have subpoenaed for a particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| It can be used, 2.02H can be used for committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| It can be used for full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| There are a number of ways to approach it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| but you need to let everybody know who it is that you wish to have subpoenaed for the meeting or the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3449)|
| 0:57:36| It's a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Hang on, Commissioner Peekson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| I just have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Do you think it's practical to try to hold that hearing during our regular commission meeting on the 24th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3466)|
| 0:57:55| Oh, that's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| I don't know the practicality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| Like I say, we've never done one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| I would think that it would take hours once you got into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| You're going to have attorneys involved for most of those who are requested to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3484)|
| 0:58:12| who are perhaps compelled to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| And, you know, who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| It may take a long while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| My suggestion is that we try to set this up for another date other than the 24th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| because we do have other county business that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| Well, first of all, we just need to see if we've got enough votes for the 202H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| Then we can set the ground rules on how to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| When we call for the 2082H whatever investigation, does that have to be a specific time and date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3517)|
| 0:58:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| I mean, what you're doing, you're basically setting it for the commission meeting, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3528)|
| 0:58:56| from what I understand from this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| And you can put it at the end of your agenda and you can start a hearing at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| But I mean, the subpoenas will be for a certain time and a day, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| Could, let's say, for instance, the mayor or any of these folks that are listed in this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| let's say they come in with their attorney and they have filed some type of court action to stop us or to contest us or, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3556)|
| 0:59:28| Possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Then we just have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| And then we'd be in an illegal battle as to whether or not we can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| Depending on how quickly we can get a hearing with the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| And our law director has nothing else to do at this time, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| I'm looking for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| I think we would hope that people would just show up and do what they're supposed to do and tell the truth and get just behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| I would hope so, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| No need to play games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| We're going to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| We're going to be sitting there under oath and we're going to have to tell the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| So to ask other people to tell the truth shouldn't be that hard in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| Okay, Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| John, a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| Does the subpoena sort of act as a pleading on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| Would it be like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| And if they did have attorneys, three attorneys, and there were conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| and let's just say that if the attorney is conflicted out but not John here is conflicted out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| then it would be hard to come up with a certain date until all the attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| and you are in some sort of agreement as to when to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| Or does it go in front of a judge for a ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| We might very well be before a judge for a ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Like I say, we've never done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| I'm just shooting straight with every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| We've never done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| I'm not sure what the pleading would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| Would they have to be some sort of pleading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| Or would the report here be the pleading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| What it may force me to do is to go to court to get authority to issue such a subpoena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3664)|
| 1:01:12| It may require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| And I don't know when I'm going to have time to do that over the next several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| We're looking at a four-week trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| I need to be in the office at this second preparing for the trial for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| We've been working very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| I've got probably three or four people still there working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| getting ready for tomorrow morning beginning at 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| So is the standard, would it be like a trial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| It's a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| You would call witnesses to the podium or to one side of the auditorium there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3708)|
| 1:01:58| and you would ask them questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| What about hearsay evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| I mean, how strict would this be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| Would you have to conform to hearsay the way that you direct and cross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| This is not a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Certainly those objections could be made by their attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| but this would be a discovery-type process where unless you were talking about privileged information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3739)|
| 1:02:28| I would imagine that someone ought to answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| Now, they have alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| There's such a thing as a Fifth Amendment that if anyone wished to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| But first of all, you have to figure out if you're going to authorize the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3760)|
| 1:02:50| it takes two-thirds vote of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Secondly, you need to let us know who it is that you wish to subpoena for that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| It may be that you don't need to subpoena anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| but if you wish to put them under oath, you would need to subpoena them most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| So if you go to court, do you go back to chancellery court on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Again, we've never done this, and so this is going to be an exploratory-type process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| As far as I know, this has not been done in the state of Tennessee, for all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3801)|
| 1:03:30| Okay, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| This is for Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| I believe I understood you to say we were taking this one step at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| and all we're investigating is the auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| The only ones we would need to subpoena would be everybody that's got an auto allowance in this case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Probably so, and probably Mr. Troyer and, well, John Werner, he had an auto allowance, so he would be subpoenaed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| Yeah, everybody that had an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| You're talking about, I think, roughly five, six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| I think we need to put that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| And then another thing you have to realize, this is for the law director, like you say, this is a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3844)|
| 1:04:11| The reason why we're subpoenaing these people is they never show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| How are we going to question them about what they've done wrong if they don't show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| That's why I was adamant about going ahead and voting on taking this allowance from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| They don't show up to defend themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| They send John Troyer down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| This is one of the most important things that's bothering this county right now that's ever happened in the history of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| You know, we had this deal here, oh, back before 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| There hasn't been another scandal like this since John Beeler and the BFI thing, and yet they don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| So I think we need to subpoena them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| We can't sit here and pass judgment we're going to give them five years in the pen, which some of them may deserve, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3893)|
| 1:05:01| But what we're wanting to do is get answers to questions, and these people out here in the audience don't know the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| So we need to subpoena them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Commissioner Ballard and then Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| And this is sort of a bizarre thought, but in Craig's, I guess, quest for due process, any of the defendants, I guess, that we would call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3916)|
| 1:05:28| would they have the right to subpoena anybody to prove their case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3928)|
| 1:05:36| It would be an investigative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| The process is for this commission to gather evidence, which would include subpoenaing witnesses to come before this body to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3939)|
| 1:05:48| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| John, do you think that given what's taken place tonight, do you think we're prepared to go ahead with a vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| to vote to go ahead and start this process right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| Do you think this body knows enough about what takes place legally to make a vote, to make an intelligent vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3968)|
| 1:06:19| I don't know how to answer that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| We've just been given the report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| I've just been given the report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| If you were sitting in my seat, John, would you be comfortable with voting yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| I cannot answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| The other question, are we going to get to hear Mr. Walz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| And that's to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| If we get these lights off and we'll take this vote, we'll get to hear it because we'll know what's going to happen on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| Because his knees are getting weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Yeah, Mr. Walz, if you want to have a seat, because you never know how long this is going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| Commissioner Tramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Yeah, we're still gathering some information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| And let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| The Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure would follow that with these subpoenas, be issued five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| and just because we're voting to have subpoena power on this investigation doesn't mean that we have to do this on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| If we get into court, we can always come back to this sometime later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| but at that point still have the authority to issue subpoenas, call witnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| and do a thorough investigation on possible charter violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| That's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Read Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| We are charged with upholding this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| This is our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Okay, we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Commissioner Lambert, I was going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| Okay, Commissioner Kate, will Commissioner Kate finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| Let me see if I understand now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| My only concern is trying to mix this in with a regular county commission meeting where we've got zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| and we're going to have people in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| So if we vote to get the subpoena power, we can then set a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Is that what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| We can do it whenever we want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| In my mind, there's no use for us to keep coming up here if we don't have people to answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| I just don't want to mix it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| We're going to have a lot of citizens here on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| This is going to take a while, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| Yeah, we can decide that after we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Okay, so the motion on the floor is to approve 202H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| Start in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Just do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4111)|

| 1:08:41| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Commissioner Kaywood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| Commissioner Frank Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Commissioner Craig Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Commissioner Kaye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Commissioner Bolus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Commissioner Jordan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| Okay, does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| You want to vote no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| Or no, you don't want to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Who was the other pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| I'm going to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| You're going to stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| Pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Pass is 14-1-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| Okay, we have 14 ayes and 1 no and 2 passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| So we did give ourselves the authority to do a 2.02H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4178)|
| 1:09:46| Okay, let's move on into this report and it's the auto travel allowance in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4186)|
| 1:09:56| Okay, now if we can maybe let Mr. Wiles get through it and Mr. Troyer respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4196)|
| 1:10:03| So again, tell us where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Okay, we're now at finding number two on page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| And actually you all have already done a pretty good job of airing this one out, but we'll go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| It's Don Compliance with Knox County Compensation Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| Knox County has a compensation plan that sets employee pay using a uniform pay setting scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| Each employee is assigned a grade, a step, and has required annual performance reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4232)|
| 1:10:40| The issues that we've identified are number one, in some cases required appraisal forms were not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4240)|
| 1:10:49| Number two, increasing salaries through a salary supplement violates the compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4249)|
| 1:10:58| Number three, additional compensation for the mayor resulted in a total salary amount greater than approved by county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4258)|
| 1:11:08| which violates section 304 of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| Our recommendation, again, is to refer the above matters to the Knox County Law Director for an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| and whether or not restitution should be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| Number two, salaries should comply with the compensation plan with all employees having annual performance appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4285)|
| 1:11:36| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Okay, Mr. Troyer, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| Yeah, I'd just like to add to this discussion that the salary pay scale is a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| It's not intended to be the only piece of information where salaries are determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| We still hold that the elected official has authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| The step scale system does give us broad guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| but the elected official still has power to make other decisions and not strictly limited to just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4320)|
| 1:12:08| And I'd also like to point out that the mayor still contends that this is an expense allowance and not a salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4328)|
| 1:12:16| so it would not be a part of the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| So those two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| Okay, Mr. Wiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| Okay, moving on to issue number three, which you'll find on page nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| There was improper W-2 reporting to the Internal Revenue Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| The Internal Revenue Service has strict guidelines regarding reporting income on Form W-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4359)|
| 1:12:47| The issues we identified as miscellaneous reimbursements were not supported by itemized documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4367)|
| 1:12:55| and were not correctly reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| Second item, the personal use value of employer-provided vehicles were not reported on Form W-2 as required by the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4381)|
| 1:13:12| Our recommendations are as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| The Finance Department should comply with IRS regulations and file appropriate W-2 wage information on all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4395)|
| 1:13:22| Number two, employees should file appropriate documentation for travel expenses with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| Number three, employees should also submit quarterly commuting statements as required by IRS regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4409)|
| 1:13:37| Number four, all unreported miscellaneous reimbursements prior to 2006 should be reported on Form W-2 to the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4417)|
| 1:13:47| The Mayor's Office concurred with this finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| Would you like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| In several instances, we have issued corrected W-2s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| Okay, I've got one question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| Were the allowance payments and personal use of vehicles commuted properly reported on W-2 as required by the IRS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4444)|
| 1:14:14| I think you've answered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| If corrections were made, when were they made on each individual and how many different years have been corrected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4456)|
| 1:14:26| We've gone back to 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| Who has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| The Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| And for which individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| That was one of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| We'll get a complete list for the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| You don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Well, on the vehicle use, we have, for the Mayor, Mike Arms, John Warner, Dwight Vandervate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4489)|
| 1:14:57| included commuting miles for their personal use of vehicle and that has been included in their W-2 corrected forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4497)|
| 1:15:10| And as far as the, in accordance with the IRS guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| the unaccounted for or the non-accountable part of the expense allowance has been included in pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4515)|
| 1:15:23| and that's been included in his W-2 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| Were these made before the auto allowance started or after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| These were made after, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| Okay, Commissioner Frank Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| Mr. Troyer, when your office submits a corrected W-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4539)|
| 1:15:49| and I assume that could be for any reason that you had previously underreported for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4549)|
| 1:15:57| that goes to the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| The IRS at that time, the employee would know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| and so it's the duty of that person if they have not previously reported that to IRS, which they could have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| In other words, they could have reported this as income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| Even though you don't have a W-2, they could have reported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| If it was not reported, then their obligation would be to file an amended return with IRS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4581)|
| 1:16:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| That's your understanding, they would do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| and if they properly paid that money plus interest or anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| that they would be then okay with IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| If they did not, then I guess IRS would investigate why they had not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4606)|
| 1:16:53| The W-2s have been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| They're going to be filed with the IRS with our quarterly return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| and it's going to be up to each individual to file an amended return for each year, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| But we have no knowledge whether in fact any of those employees did or did not report that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4623)|
| 1:17:11| and that's not really our job, I guess, to know whether they had or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| It's up to the IRS and the person to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| Yes, I don't know what's on their personal return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Commissioner Lutho, my question wasn't that we need to get into their IRS business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| The question was, should the finance department and the payroll people not know how to list this properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4648)|
| 1:17:38| Because I'm sure they all knew these folks had county vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| and they look on their check and they're getting an auto allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| and they should know how to properly file on their paychecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| Mr. Chairman, I do not disagree with your assessment when I owed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| John, this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| You've amended their W-2 forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| But you only done this after they were caught, is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| It's been done in two phases in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| But it started after June the 7th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Commissioner Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| These miscellaneous reimbursements which were not supported, what are some examples of these offhand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| I mean, what are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Is it the same thing over and over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| Is it a hodgepodge of different things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| What are we talking about here exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| I mean, you're talking about miscellaneous reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| What are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| There were no receipts turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| On what, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| I mean, give me an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| They just received the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| They turned in no receipts whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| The mayor turned in some early in his term, but that ceased after a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4725)|
| 1:18:53| If you go to, I believe it's exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| I didn't mean to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| I'm just trying to get a better picture here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Is this something that happened very rarely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| Is it something that happened continuously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| I mean, is it certain things or not certain things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| Does it have a pattern or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| If you go to exhibit five, it's exhibit five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| It would be the next to the last exhibit in the back of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Well, why don't we wait until we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| Commissioner Bozes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Exhibit five, if you have that in front of you, what that shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| Let's just go on and we'll get to that at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| So let's just keep in order if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| You ready to go to issue number four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Issue number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| I'm going to talk page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Issue number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Payroll procedures were not followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| One of the controls established in Knox County is the utilization of a payroll authorization change form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| to communicate to payroll the changes that are made to salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| Our issue was that payroll changes were communicated to the payroll department by email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| instead of using a payroll authorization change form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| Our recommendation is require all payroll adjustments to be authorized using a payroll authorization change form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| with all necessary approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| Management concurred with us on this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| Okay, Mr. Troyer, do you want to respond to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| I think I'll just leave the response to what's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Well, I know, but if you want to respond, because these folks out here don't have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| Do you all have copies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| I mean, I don't know if people at home watching us would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| Okay, I'll just, from the report, management concurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| although we do note the authority of the mayor under Article III of the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| to waive administrative rules to the extent necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| This is for Richard Walls there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| Richard, I was reading here, you said, but not following payroll procedures or having required approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| it creates an opportunity for unauthorized transactions to occur and go undetected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| I want everybody to understand that they disobeyed the rules, the guidelines that we had set forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| and that's how this went undetected for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| It's because they did not follow the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| Do you want to move to the next item, Mr. Walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Okay, that was the final finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| And if you move to the back of the report, when you read the report and each finding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| it refers to the exhibits that are applicable to each finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| Exhibit 1 is the memo that was sent to you guys by Dwight Vanderbeet on May 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| reporting that the auto allowance was actually a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| If you move on to Exhibit 2, these are the emails that were sent to the payroll department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4924)|
| 1:22:14| instead of using the payroll authorization change forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| Exhibit 3 is an example of a payroll authorization change form for Todd Cook setting forth his auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4941)|
| 1:22:36| Exhibit 4 is an authorization change form setting forth the bonus to Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4956)|
| 1:22:47| Exhibit 5 is the item that Commissioner Bolas was inquiring about that shows a detailed listing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4967)|
| 1:22:57| by month and by year of the miscellaneous reimbursement paid to the mayor from 2002 through 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4977)|
| 1:23:10| And those descriptions on the side would give you some idea of the receipts that were turned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| and for what years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| Then Exhibit 6 was a memo from John Troyer that was attached to their response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5004)|
| 1:23:33| and instead of reproducing the memo in the report, we've attached a copy of the memo in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5013)|
| 1:23:41| Do you have any questions on the exhibits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| I've got one question for Mr. Troyer and it's just for my information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| Looking at Exhibit 6, you're talking about this money is used for such as buying tables for charity events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5032)|
| 1:24:03| Is the mayor's office, does he not have an account there that we approved $50,000 for his community grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5043)|
| 1:24:12| slash expenses that we approved this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| Yeah, that amount is in the budget, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| With the $20,000 you're saying is used for this as well, so that's $70,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| And what did Mr. Shumpert have, you say $12,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| Right, he also had some budgetary authority in addition to, I mean there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| he had some budgetary authority within the budget in addition to the expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5079)|
| 1:24:48| Okay, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| This $20,000 in a pay supplement, I guess, is that what we're calling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| The mayor is the only one that is still receiving that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| But the car allowance, whatever we're calling it now, the $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| Right, the mayor is getting it and everyone else in the office is no longer receiving these monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5107)|
| 1:25:15| Except for Ms. Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| She's receiving an auto allowance and she does not have a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Entitled to that because she does not receive a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Could I make the motion that we suspend payment on that $20,000 pending this upcoming investigation on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5124)|
| 1:25:38| I mean I know it's a little early to ask folks to pay the money back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| but as a start, could we just see that we don't pay any more out since this is money that's very likely that we ask to pay back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5142)|
| 1:25:53| I mean I'm just bringing it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Does that sound reasonable to anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| Well, with the law director being gone to prepare for our trial tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| since we've got the 2.02H investigation, I think we can take care of that at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5163)|
| 1:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| I mean Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Mr. Pinkston, if I had some tobacco here, I'd spit in this cup here and say it don't look good for the mayor at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| Look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| Johnson messed up in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| We only show what on this exhibit five on $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| Was there not more things that were spent in these other years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| What am I missing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| Or were you just treating it different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| Early on our expectation was that the mayor was electing an accountable plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| and he later chose to go to the non-accountable plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| and therefore would be reporting his expenses individually on the tax return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5211)|
| 1:27:00| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| Okay. Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| John, I know you probably don't know the answer to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| but was any of this money spent to support some of the candidates that the mayor wanted for county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5228)|
| 1:27:19| I don't know how the mayor spends his money, but I don't expect that any of it was spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5239)|
| 1:27:27| You don't think any of it was? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| I want to add some more names on their subpoena then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| Another thing is I want to ask you, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| is this the last thing this is going to be called, an expense allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| You know, here May the 24th it started out for reimbursements of things that they bought while they were gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5260)|
| 1:27:47| And then I questioned them about the credit card, what that was used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Then they changed it from that to a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| Now this is in less than five minutes from a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| And when we questioned them about having a car and all their gas furnished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| then it went from that to a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| So this is the last thing that's going to be called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| Now we don't want any more spend on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Is this the very last thing that's to be called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| I think an expense allowance is the best description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| Is that what the $50,000 is called that's budgeted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| Seriously, is that in the line item budget for expense account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| The $50,000 is in addition to this, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Yeah, but is it called expense account also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| If I look at it in the line item budget, where do I find that at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070910special?start=5318)|
