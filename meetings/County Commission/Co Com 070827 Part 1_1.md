| 2:39:40| Time is 429.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| My name is Ricky Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| I live at 6810 Truesdale Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| I'm here to lodge a complaint against Judge Bill Swan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| He's incompetent, he's unethical, and he's a liar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| I got documentation proving he lied to the Board of Judiciary to cover up his own incompetence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9596)|
| 2:40:01| and I want the people of Knox County to join together and get rid of this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9601)|
| 2:40:06| I want to ask the mayor and all the commission members, if you all look at my documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| I got documentation to prove everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| I got documentation to prove he's a liar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| I got documentation to prove he's incompetent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| And like I said, I want you all to look at the material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| and do whatever has to be done to remove him from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| He does not care about kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| My kids were physically abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9627)|
| 2:40:32| I testified she was beating my son with a closed fist at five years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| and yet both lawyers asked for an order of protection for my kids, and he dismissed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| I went to court later on, and what Judge Swan said in open court, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9642)|
| 2:40:48| I don't really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| I was trying to introduce evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| and I want all the people of Knox County to stand up against this incompetent person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| I've got, I'm working on filing complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| Judge Mike Moyer, I'm collecting evidence on him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| and we need to get rid of these judges who don't care about kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| who don't care about doing a job right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| They care about what time they get out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:17| My divorce trial, excuse me, my custody for my kids lasts an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| The previous court case lasts 29 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9682)|
| 2:41:27| But I'm trying to let the people of Knox County know that Judge Bill Swan is incompetent, unethical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9687)|
| 2:41:34| and he's a liar, and he don't care about kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| I got documentation proof he was not even paying his own child's court order, child support himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9697)|
| 2:41:43| I've got a newspaper article that states basically that his son will not have anything to do with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| and when the father's son won't have anything to do with him, I ain't saying too much as a father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9708)|
| 2:41:53| And this guy is going out and telling other people about how to raise their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| It's insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| But like I say, I'm trying to do what I can to let the public know what's going on, how the court systems work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9720)|
| 2:42:06| There's revenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| I've, since I've brought all this stuff public against Bill Swan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9728)|
| 2:42:13| I've had things happen to me that should not have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9733)|
| 2:42:16| It's all because of the revenge of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| And, like I say, this is signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9742)|
| 2:42:32| Also, let's say there's an allegation that he beat his wife up and we can't find his divorce papers anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| And that is against the law there for him to hide his divorce papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9757)|
| 2:42:40| They're supposed to be open in public domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9760)|
| 2:42:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9765)|

| 2:46:58| I'm the part of the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| Who wants to send newspapers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| I knew the ex-editor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| He told me that Knoxville is in our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| It shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| They bought another paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| Now, we shouldn't allow Knoxville or anybody to dictate, to tell you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10032)|
| 2:47:19| You're doing great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| I think to me, the way you elected people was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10040)|
| 2:47:25| He says second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10045)|
| 2:47:26| Who says second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10046)|
| 2:47:27| Another wants to come to case all the way to Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10047)|

| 2:47:36| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10056)|
| 2:47:37| It would be foolish for you to redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| They don't deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| They were elected legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| People elected them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| And I am going to tell you, I will be stockholder very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| I will try to get that editor out of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| I will help all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| Recently, I got a few dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| Believe me, it is a great city, great town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10077)|
| 2:48:00| Stop Sue Kubler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10080)|
| 2:48:01| Let's help each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| Nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| This is why they are making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| I don't know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| You said that we should go all the way to Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| Go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10090)|
| 2:48:11| It is easy to win the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| Simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10093)|
| 2:48:14| So simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10094)|
| 2:48:15| Forget what they say about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| Recently, a big-shot lawyer sued me in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10098)|
| 2:48:22| Backshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| I lost one case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| Third case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10106)|
| 2:48:27| Third time I won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10107)|
| 2:48:28| I sued them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10108)|
| 2:48:29| I won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10110)|
| 2:48:31| I'll teach you how to win your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:32| It is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10112)|
| 2:48:33| I'm telling you, Mr. Robbins, go all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| You don't deserve to tell any one of these commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| They should quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| Why they should resign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| Mr. Frank, your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| Thank you for allowing me to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10126)|
| 2:48:47| Thank you, all of you, for doing great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10127)|
| 2:48:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| Oh, by the way, one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| I am available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| I'm not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10136)|
| 2:48:57| I'll spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10137)|
| 2:48:58| I don't like any one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| I don't know her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10140)|
| 2:49:01| I will defend Cynthia or anybody who has been accused for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10146)|

| 2:49:10| You will be elected again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| Thank you to tell them that we should go all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10151)|
| 2:49:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10155)|
| 2:49:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10156)|
| 2:49:17| Louis Cosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10157)|
| 2:49:26| And if you'll give your name and address of the record, the time is 440.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10166)|
| 2:49:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| My name is Louis Cosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10176)|
| 2:49:37| I live at 10215 Thimblefields Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10177)|
| 2:49:43| I'm here as a concerned taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10183)|
| 2:49:48| I'll give you a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10188)|
| 2:49:49| I graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1972 with a degree in accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| Got a CPA in 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10193)|
| 2:49:57| Have held that ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| I've been an inactive CPA for the last few years because I've been involved in broadcasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10199)|
| 2:50:05| I've been an owner and a general manager of three television stations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10205)|
| 2:50:12| And I read the article in the newspaper about the credit card receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10212)|
| 2:50:21| And at one time I audited Knox County when Mr. Kessel was county executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10221)|
| 2:50:28| and Mr. Acuff was the director of finance and he was a tough guy and did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10228)|
| 2:50:37| But I read that article and there was an attachment to that article that was four or five pages of the P-card records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10237)|
| 2:50:47| And I reviewed those and I just said, that's just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10247)|
| 2:50:52| And knowing what you can and can't do with governmental funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10252)|
| 2:51:01| I took the mayor up on coming by and looking at the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10261)|
| 2:51:08| And I did that for a couple of days and had some questions that I've formed and put in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10268)|
| 2:51:14| and sent to the mayor regarding some of the expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10274)|
| 2:51:19| And also I've looked at some of the disbursements and the records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10279)|
| 2:51:26| and the activity of the Knox County Hospitality Fund, which I was surprised that we even had such a fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10286)|
| 2:51:34| Because anything I've ever known about governmental accounting and books, you don't have these kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10294)|
| 2:51:44| So I've raised some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| And to date I really haven't gotten any answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| I did not see a single TER or that's the form that Knox County uses for travel and expense reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10310)|
| 2:51:58| I didn't see, and I'm talking about in the mayor's office in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10318)|
| 2:52:03| And I did not see much compliance with Knox County travel policy or the P-card policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10323)|
| 2:52:15| And what I have suggested for you, and so that we can get this past us, is that there's going to be an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10335)|
| 2:52:25| You know, I know I think the Division of County Audit is going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| And they charge for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| And this is going to, as to the state of the records right now, I say they're borderline inaudible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10351)|
| 2:52:38| Because they have not been maintained in compliance with general accepted county principles and Knox County policy regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10358)|
| 2:52:48| So if what I would suggest you do is that Mr. Walls be given assistance, you know, from the Division of County Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10368)|
| 2:52:58| There's three people in his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| And that the mayor and his staff that have used credit cards for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10380)|
| 2:53:09| I think it goes back to about October 2003 through June 30, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10389)|
| 2:53:15| that they be requested to complete the travel and expense reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10395)|
| 2:53:24| and meet all the requirements of the travel code, per diems, meals, lodging, documentation, receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10404)|
| 2:53:35| everything that you and I have ever done in completing an expense report, that that amount be calculated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10415)|
| 2:53:45| and that the money that has been advanced by Knox County during that period for those individuals be calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10425)|
| 2:53:54| And if there's a difference between what meets the criteria under the travel and expense reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10434)|
| 2:54:01| that if there's a difference that that individual repay Knox County for that difference plus interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10441)|
| 2:54:09| And as to the end, I might want to add, since July 1, 2007, that's exactly what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10449)|
| 2:54:17| I think Mr. Ragsdale said that you're completing TERs now, right, and that you're following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10457)|
| 2:54:23| I'll answer you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| And if he does, I think if we do that, we'll give something to the auditors, something to audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10465)|
| 2:54:36| And we will get this past us and we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10476)|
| 2:54:41| As to the hospitality fund, I think people have made contributions to that in two forms, restricted and unrestricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10481)|
| 2:54:53| If the amount was a restricted gift, that that donor be given an accounting of how we spent that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10493)|
| 2:55:03| And that if there's any difference, if there's anything left over, Knox County should be writing a check to that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10503)|
| 2:55:12| If it's an unrestricted gift, then there should be an accounting of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:19| But in my view, if you look at what's happened, that fund was not properly accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10519)|
| 2:55:27| So that's my suggestion to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10527)|
| 2:55:32| And I don't know if you want to do that, how you want to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| But that's, as it says, and that's what I suggest that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| Mr. Cosby, thank you for, I know you spent a lot of time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| We appreciate it and we will forward it to Richard and to the auditors here from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10542)|
| 2:55:48| Mr. Chairman, I feel like the mayor deserves an opportunity to respond if he would like to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10548)|
| 2:55:52| I don't know that he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10553)|
| 2:55:54| I've asked him and he hasn't responded to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10554)|
| 2:55:58| I had a couple of questions of Lewis, if that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| Or the mayor first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| Do you want the mayor to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| I believe he wants to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| Well, first let me say that every document that Mr. Cosby requested, I think we have provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10569)|
| 2:56:14| We've told our staff and hopefully we've treated him with kindness and cordiality when he's visited with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10574)|
| 2:56:20| I sure appreciate his interest in our local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| Make no mistake about it, we could have done some things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| In the future, we will do them better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| As you're aware, we've reduced the number of purchasing cards from over 170 to less than 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10590)|
| 2:56:36| We have stronger oversight programs in place, as well as new policies to monitor our travel expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10596)|
| 2:56:43| When we found things that were done wrong, we did our very best to try and fix them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10603)|
| 2:56:48| Last week, I personally visited with the comptroller, Mr. Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10608)|
| 2:56:52| He's coming in to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| I have great confidence in Mr. Morgan and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10614)|
| 2:56:57| They don't have any political agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| They want to just help make the county better, and I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10619)|
| 2:57:03| When I reflect back on the past five years, I suspect that instead of maybe going to read with school kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:10| I could have spent more time in the office working on financial matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10630)|
| 2:57:13| But when you have 500 volunteers in your Read With Me program, I think part of being mayor is being a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| I wanted to be there with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| I've done that one morning every week for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10640)|
| 2:57:25| I suspect I could have probably monitored financial issues better if I had stayed at the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10645)|
| 2:57:31| instead of making 478 business visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10651)|
| 2:57:36| My goal was to encourage our existing businesses to stay here, prosper, and create new jobs for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10656)|
| 2:57:44| Working with you, we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| I want to be active with positive initiatives that make a real difference in people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10667)|
| 2:57:55| I have no interest in being a critic to promote myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10675)|
| 2:58:01| Give me just a few moments if I could to reflect on a few things that we have done over the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10681)|
| 2:58:08| Some of them may be forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| We've opened new Amherst, Ricky McLeod, Gibbs, and Cedar Bluff Elementary Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10691)|
| 2:58:20| We're building the first new high school in this county in not years, but in decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10700)|
| 2:58:26| We're expanding Powell Middle School and renovating it, and we've spent $15 million in fiscal plan upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10706)|
| 2:58:35| When you consider the school's operating budget, our great schools partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| and the amount of money we've spent on debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10719)|
| 2:58:42| we've increased education funding by $70 million plus in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10722)|
| 2:58:49| As a result of this commitment, you've seen teachers and kids and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10729)|
| 2:58:54| and people who represent our school system working together than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10734)|
| 2:59:00| As a result, our children's ACT scores are higher than not only the state average, but the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10740)|
| 2:59:08| This is an example of what we can do working together, not fighting with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10748)|
| 2:59:15| Instead of focusing on negatives, I'd like to focus on a couple of positives for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10755)|
| 2:59:23| Our senior citizens deserve dignity, respect, and care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10763)|
| 2:59:30| We've tried to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| We've expanded the O'Connor Center downtown, the Strang Center out west, and a center in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10772)|
| 2:59:38| We've opened new senior centers in Halls and in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10778)|
| 2:59:42| We're breaking ground soon on a new Carter Senior Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10782)|
| 2:59:46| and one in Mascot we've put some major remodeling into and we plan on doing even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10786)|
| 2:59:51| I'm proud of this because our programs continue to expand, our attendance continues to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10791)|
| 2:59:55| seniors are more active, engaged, and involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10795)|
| 3:00:00| I don't know if any of you have visited the VA nursing home since it opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10800)|
| 3:00:04| but we did a lot of lobbying on that, spent a lot of time and a lot of money getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10804)|
| 3:00:09| Through the works of this body and your predecessors, in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10809)|
| 3:00:16| we allocated $6 million and donated land to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10816)|
| 3:00:21| Every time I go there and visit with veterans, I leave a better person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10821)|
| 3:00:28| When there was a need to fund mobile meals, this commission stepped up, worked with me and our citizens, we got it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10828)|
| 3:00:36| When there were transportation issues involving seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10836)|
| 3:00:40| we arranged for them to ride Knoxville Transit buses any day of the week, any route, free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10840)|
| 3:00:48| In an era when some communities had given up on public libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| you, along with our citizens, decided it was better to invest in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10852)|
| 3:00:57| And so we've opened new libraries in Fountain City, Halls, Powell, Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10857)|
| 3:01:04| and we've taken our Beck Cultural Exchange Center and made it a community treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10864)|
| 3:01:11| We've expanded the park system by over 500 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10871)|

| 3:01:26| and we've absorbed a $57 million debt on the pension plan for the initial cost of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10886)|
| 3:01:34| Some have questioned our ability to keep good financial records and manage money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10894)|
| 3:01:39| and certainly we're due our share of criticism. I've acknowledged that to you several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10899)|
| 3:01:43| But let me remind you of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| By working together with you and our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10905)|
| 3:01:48| we've done all the things I've mentioned over the past five years without a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10908)|
| 3:01:54| And we've maintained a great bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| We've been criticized by some for raising private sector money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10918)|
| 3:02:02| I don't apologize for that. We'll continue to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10922)|
| 3:02:07| We've not raised thousands of dollars. We've raised hundreds of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10927)|
| 3:02:15| We brought in two exhibits from the Smithsonian and arranged for our citizens to go for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10935)|
| 3:02:21| The September 11th Memorial Exhibit and the United We Stand Exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10941)|

| 3:02:35| It funded the Stony Road Exhibit at our Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10955)|
| 3:02:40| It's a great exhibit on integration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10960)|
| 3:02:43| Our citizens are better for having it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10963)|
| 3:02:47| We've raised private sector money for senior summits, education summits, neighborhood conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10967)|
| 3:02:53| movies on the mall, jazz festivals, imagination library, and first day festivals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10973)|
| 3:03:00| I think they're all good initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| We sought private sector donations for FluMist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10983)|
| 3:03:09| It didn't cost us a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| Last year we vaccinated 35,000 school children free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=10991)|
