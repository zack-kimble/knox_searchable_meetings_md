| 0:00:51| I just want to remind you that this is the board's public business meeting to discuss items that come before us for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=51)|
| 0:00:58| So we would just ask that you be respectful and courteous at all times and just be mindful that the sound carries pretty easily in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=58)|

| 0:01:09| Are there any requested changes to the meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| OK. Motion by Ms. Horne, second by Mr. Triplett. All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=74)|
| 0:01:22| OK. Motion passes. Dr. Reislich?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. I want to say welcome back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| I hope that you, along with our students and staff, enjoyed some well-earned time off over the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| The winter break is always a good opportunity to rest and recharge as we gear up for the second semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| As you know, our students and staff worked hard last semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| Thanks to their effort and dedication, we accomplished a lot in the fall, and we intend to accomplish a lot this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| This is a season of New Year's resolution, and it's easy to get swept up in trying new things or committing to new work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=111)|
| 0:01:57| But I want to take a moment to reiterate that we intend to remain committed to our four priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| excellence in foundational skills, great educators in every school, career empowerment and preparation, and success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| You've heard me talk about these priorities a lot, and that's intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Public education has become a national topic of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| It's easy to let those conversations distract us from our work and from our mission of graduating every student ready for the future of their choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| It is our job to ensure that students and staff are able to remain focused on their critically important work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| and we do that by centering our resources, efforts, and attention to our four priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| We know that this is the work of an exemplary school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| I'm proud of the work our schools are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| I'm proud of our teachers, administrators, and staff for being people of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| We have proven over the last year that we're not just talking about change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| We're doing the hard work, and we're already seeing results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| Last year, we increased third-grade reading proficiency by nearly five percentage points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| At 43 percent, our third-grade proficiency is the highest it's ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| We made these gains by focusing on the fundamentals, by doing the hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| by investing and using high-quality instructional materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| and by concentrating more on regionalized instructional support within our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| We still have work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Forty-three percent is a record high for us, but we won't be content until every student is performing at or above grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| We also invested $24.8 million in a four percent increase for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| and an additional eight percent increase for 12 percent total for our custodians, security, school, clerical, and educational assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=205)|
| 0:03:36| At 80 percent, investment in people make up the single largest investment in our annual operating budget, and that's intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| We know that our people are the ones who make the learning possible for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| Being the best means preparing our students for success, not just in the classroom but after graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| Last year, eight high schools launched a freshman academy as part of our 865 initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| In our first year alone, more than 340 business partners throughout the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| volunteered to provide students a firsthand look at the world beyond the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| These insights and experiences are invaluable to preparing students for life after graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| Our eight pilot schools began this year with their full industry academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| giving students the opportunities to learn everyday content through a lens that's interesting to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| Later this month, we'll announce the 865 academies at our remaining high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| to ensure every student in Knox County has the benefit of a small learning community environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| tailored to their long-term interest and aptitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| We do this work with the intent of creating environments capable of fostering success for every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| and that often means individualizing our approach to learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| We kicked off this year with a Region 5 plan, the Region 5 Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| a five-year strategic plan to closing persistent achievement gaps in many of our most historic schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| And we're already making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| In the fall, we sent a scout team to Fairfax, Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| to begin the process of planning our K-12 International Baccalaureate Pipeline in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| We have increased communication to families in the form of monthly and quarterly updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| on the progress we're making toward the Region 5 strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| We are supporting staff through weekly intentional professional learning opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| that the Region 5 team has dubbed Transformational Thursdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| And we're preparing to launch student success passports through this region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| which will provide students with specific learning goals to address their individual learning goals and needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| Later this evening, you'll also receive an update from Mr. Myers on the extensive work being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| in our deep dive to student success services, interventions, and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| I say all this to say that our four priorities are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| This is not just the work, but it is the right work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Board members, as you know, the FY25 budget is just around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| In past years, it seems like we've approached every budget as a, quote, tough budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| This year, I want you to know that we're facing a unique budgeting season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| Our team is preparing to present you with a budget that is intentional, strategic, and student-focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| As you know, ESSER funds will be rolling off this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| and we're anticipating a much flatter increase to TESA funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| For the first time ever, we'll also have the results of a comprehensive salary study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| and facilities assessment to inform our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| I'm committed to maximizing every dollar, and we've made the biggest impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| that will make the biggest impact on our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| and doing as much as we can in response to the results of our salary study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| and our facilities assessment this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| I've asked our divisions and departments to justify their individual budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| aligning every expense to one of our four priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| For those of you who have been around, you know this is a new approach for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| We typically start with a budget, and we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| We're not doing that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Each one of our departments and divisions are working with their assistant superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| and justifying their alignment to one of our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| For us, this work began in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| I want to thank more than 2,000 stakeholders who participated in our annual budget survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| Your insight on the impact of our work is much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| As our department and divisions work through budget justifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| our finance team is planning to engage the regional teacher and family councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| to gather more targeted feedback for the FY25 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| The KCS staffing committee, which is composed of school principals, regional leaderships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| and representatives from finance, HR, and REA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=432)|

| 0:07:20| for our school staffing formulas to ensure we have the staffing we need for the right student outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| In short, we are taking an intentional, priorities-aligned approach to this budget-setting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| and look forward to bringing a student-outcomes-based budget to you later this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| This has been a lengthy update, but it's the first one of the semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| I had to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| But I hope it showcases the tremendous work our district is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| and just how much our students and staff have accomplished this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| In closing, I want to remind families that schools will be closed on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| Dr. King is a man of faith and a man of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| He was a man of faith and a man of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| I've always admired his mission to create opportunities for all people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| and I hope that our commitment to providing a quality education for every student in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| reflects the spirit of his life's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| I look forward to attending the annual MLK luncheon later this week with members of our senior staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| and seeing many of you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=493)|

| 0:08:19| That was a robust update, but I think it goes to show, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| how many great things that are going on in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| I think it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, which, for everybody, that's normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| but it is good to see all of the great work that's going on in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=510)|

| 0:08:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Good to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| I just want to first let you know this is a draft report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| but there will be no significant changes to this report we're planning to finalize at the end of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| As we're in wrap-up of a 400-page report, as this is, and you get into the holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| I always like to take one final review of the report before it goes final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| When we send out a final report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| we will also send out what we consider an audit committee letter or a governance letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| It will be very similar to the letter you had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| In fact, it will be near identical to the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| It's just a general communication letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| The only thing new in there will discuss responsibilities regarding independence for both the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| and for us as the audit firm, but it's standard language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| Outside of that, we're going to go over the draft report tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| and we will focus on the beginning of the report and the end of the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| because those are the primary areas that are looked at in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| First of all, I want to thank Garrett Raid and his team for their assistance during our audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| We started our audit process back in May by visiting high schools and performing our testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| because we do individual testing of every single school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| The high schools we normally visit because the records are extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| Other schools' records are normally boxed up and brought to us in the TVA tower, UT tower now, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=624)|
| 0:10:33| And then we normally do our testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Our team is there for pretty much the month of June and July into early August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| and we do the bulk of our testing then, do some wrap-up after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| and we really start a report process late October, early November, and we're at this stage right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| Well, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| Let's go ahead and go into the report itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| I'm going to start on page, right after this page, the table of contents for three pages just for reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=662)|
| 0:11:13| and then let's go ahead to PDF page 6, which is our, pages 6 through 8 here are our audit report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=673)|
| 0:11:25| and this is the same similar audit report that you've had in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| Just if you read it carefully, it's kind of an awkward report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| because we're required by the state of Tennessee to report under Tennessee state guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| so technically the report is not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| Instead, it's in accordance with the basis established by the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| and basically it's really primarily a cash receipt and just a few receivables, a few payables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=710)|
| 0:11:58| but we don't put fixed assets on the books and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| As a step back as well, the internal school funds, as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| cover basically the checking activity that's at each individual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| Each school has their own checking account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| and this basically covers all the receipts and disbursements that run through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| This report does not cover activity through the central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| so that is covered in a separate report that is part of the Knox County government report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| But for this report, it goes through that second section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| unmodified opinion on the regulatory basis of accounting and an adverse opinion on U.S. GAAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| Don't worry about those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| The unmodified opinion on the regulatory basis is what it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| So this is your standard report for an internal school fund in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| I'm going to skip forward to pages 9 through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| Pages 9 and 10 are the balance sheet, and then pages 11 and 12 are the income statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=780)|
| 0:13:08| It's really small print on the screen there. I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| But when you're getting all the schools onto one report here, that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| But from a summary number perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| total cash held in the checking accounts of the 90-plus schools at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| June 30, 2023, was right at $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| Revenues, basically receipts coming into the schools during the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| just through the schools' checking accounts, which is really at the bottom of page 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| was $23.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| And expenses going out, disbursements basically, were $22.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| Ending fund balance for all the schools was roughly $15 million as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| which makes sense because typically cash and fund balance are going to match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| when it's primarily a cash basis report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| So that's basically the front of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Right after that, we'll have the footnotes, which will go for a couple pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| And then right after that, we'll start the balance sheet and income for all schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| They are done in alphabetical order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| And beginning with AL lots there, since it's alphabetical order and we do elementary schools first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| if you're trying to find a particular school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| we go alphabetical order by elementary schools, then middle schools, then high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| then alternative schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| And you can also follow the table of contents to find a particular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| With that, I'm going to go all the way to the back of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| and we can talk about compliance near the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| Let's go to PDF page 399.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=892)|
| 0:15:01| These two pages here are basically our report regarding internal control over financial reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=901)|
| 0:15:09| and reporting compliance and other matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| As is common in an internal school funds report where you have limited internal controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=912)|
| 0:15:19| and a lot of transactions, basically one bookkeeper at a school who, in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| is performing multiple roles, then there are going to be exceptions from what we consider an exception from a procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=926)|
| 0:15:39| So it's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| It's expected that you're going to have exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| We had 12 different findings this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| That compares to we really had the same 12 findings the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| What I do like to look at, though, is the number of instances of exceptions for each finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| The findings will start on page 401, and they go through page 414.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=960)|
| 0:16:19| But the findings go for areas like segregation of duties, negative fund balances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| disbursement receipts, purchase orders, ticket reconciliation, fundraising and resale activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| school support organizations, approval of transfers, unclaimed property, escheat rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| funds not received, not received, and travel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| As an overview, we had more exceptions this year, which we prefer not to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| But we had some areas where there were improvements, some areas where we had more exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| Areas that we had improvements were item number one, finding number one, and finding number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| And finding one, segregation of duties, that's an important one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| because you have better controls in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| At least the chance of funds going somewhere they're not supposed to significantly lessen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1035)|
| 0:17:23| meaning that you have checks and balances in place in segregation of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| So very encouraging that segregation of duties were better in FY23 compared to FY22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1046)|
| 0:17:36| Also, funds not received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Basically, what that finding is, number 11 on page 412, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| basically would mean that funds are received in the classroom by a teacher and don't get received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1067)|
| 0:17:56| Or often the case, they may accidentally use a Venmo account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| which is linked to their personal checking account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| It still gets transferred over, but it's not the control that we want set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| So we had less exceptions in that area this past year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| So those are two significant areas where we had less exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Where we had more exceptions were what I consider to be documentation areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| like disbursements, receipts, and purchase orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| And as you're looking through the findings, I would look at the conditions section for each finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| because that's really the detail of what the exception is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| So look at that area to see where we had exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| And also in there, it will be noted how many exceptions we had this year compared to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| Because, like for instance, for segregation of duties and the conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| we mentioned that we had 49 schools that have segregation of duty challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| but that went down by 28 schools the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| And keep in mind, for an elementary school, it's really hard to have segregation of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| When you have a smaller school, you have one bookkeeper who's also kind of like an office manager at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1150)|
| 0:19:24| and the principal running around, it's harder to have the ideal segregation of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1164)|
| 0:19:34| But I know Garrett's team has worked on putting procedures in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| to try and have controls and checks and balances to the extent able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| So that was a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| And again, a negative was areas like receipts and disbursements, we had more exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| And if you look at the conditions section, that will explain what we consider to be an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| So that's kind of a summary of our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| Again, the main numbers are in the front of the report, our opinions in the front of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| and then the findings are in the back of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1216)|
| 0:20:28| Doesn't look like we have any questions. That's good. You don't have to answer anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Fine either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Thank you so much. I know a lot of work goes into this report, and it takes up a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| So thank you so much for being so thorough and for the job that you do for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Thank you. Again, our team really appreciates the cooperation we get from Garrett Radin's team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1245)|
| 0:20:55| but also from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Bookkeepers and principals are responsive to us, and we need everybody's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| And the management team, including Jennifer and Ron, are very helpful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| So we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Thank you. That's good to hear. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| Moving on. Hold on. Let me get situated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| Mr. Myers, thank you for updating us on what's going on with special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1287)|
| 0:21:36| Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board, Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| I'm here tonight to share an interim report around the change initiative that we're working on in special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| Back in September, I stood before this board and made a commitment to lead this change work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Dr. Reiswick charged me with leading this initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| and I used the word excited to describe how I felt about leading this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| And after that meeting, I had people ask, is excited really the word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| It sounds like that could be hard, difficult, challenging, whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| But exciting really is the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| To me, change is the only real competitive advantage that our organization can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| Our capacity to change and evolve is what really promotes our growth and sustainability over years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| And that, to me, is what change is about. It's what this initiative is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| By being placed in charge of this, it also allows me to see firsthand by working with our groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| And I'm going to front load some of this so I don't have to read it off all the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| But everything you're going to see tonight is what makes change and leading those initiatives special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| The thing that's exciting about it is working with the Special Education Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| hearing what they believe is important, what their values are, why they want to engage in this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| meeting with our Student Success Leadership Council, understanding the principal perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| what do they believe is going to be important, what drives them to engage in this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| reviewing the information we got from our various input portals, not just last winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| but the new staff input portal that we launched just before the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| And the magical part about change, without sounding too corny, is when all of those things start to align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| and you realize that groups of people who perhaps thought they weren't on the same page are far closer than they had imagined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| And then all of a sudden, real productivity occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| And at the end of the day, when we're leading change in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| that productivity means a change in meaningful opportunities for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| and our families to better interface with our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| And so when I say excited, that's the exciting part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| So it wasn't like blink twice if you're in danger excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| It was like I meant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| And so that's what we're going to talk about this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| And so I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to work with our Special Education Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| which, of course, this year was comprised of our Special Education Task Force members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| And some of those folks are here with me this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| I guess they felt like I needed a confidence boost, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| They've been a pleasure to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Our school leaders on the Student Success Leadership Council have also been incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| And then I was very pleased with the amount of participation that we had from our second round of input portals from each level of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| So what you're going to see tonight is all of those things put together to cast a very clear vision forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| for the foundational elements of the KCS way for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| And then I didn't turn the clicker on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| It was going so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| All right, so this slide we've seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| I'm not going to spend a lot of time going over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| But as a reminder, the Special Education Initiative is part of a more global project in the Student Success Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| This is the work out, and I'm going to reference many times that meaningful change work takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| So if you're looking at this and you're like, man, this guy's been working on this since last winter, that is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| And it's not because we're being slow because we want to kick the can or do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| We're being slow because slow means we're being purposeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| We're making sure we have the right voices at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| We're making sure that we're doing the research on our end to put our best foot forward for our students and for our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| So, yes, this has been a long process so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| And later tonight we'll talk about some things that are even going to be further out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| So this is how we've gotten to where we are this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| So obviously we just ended the fall semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| We are back in winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| But you can see there we're taking action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Tonight we're going to talk about some of those actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| At the beginning I referenced the various groups that I've had the opportunity to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| And so this slide is intended to sort of try and articulate, I guess, the way my brain felt like this should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| And I want to thank CALMS for putting this together because you can see already my brain is a dangerous place to try to get inside of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| So, you know, we started with those staff and community input portals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| And once we got that information, I dispatched internal working groups with our special education staff to start synthesizing that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1557)|
| 0:26:05| and adapting it for something that could actually be useful for schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| We want to take complex findings, simplify them, identify areas for opportunity, make it digestible for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| Well, in the past maybe we would have sent that directly to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| That's not the way this project was intended to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| So you can see here we've got this sort of feedback cycle, this loop going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| So the products from the working groups then cycled back through our special education council and our student success leadership council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| And as a reminder, those are two separate lenses for feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Special education council is that parent lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| We want to know how does this feel from the parent perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| The leadership council is school principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| We want to know how does it feel from the principal perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| What supports will we need to be successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| Those two groups provided critical feedback to the products that were developed in the working groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| And then it cycled back to the working groups to make sure that what we were going to push out to schools aligned to the feedback that we were actually getting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| So it's important for us to say what we were going to do and then actually do it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| So these councils are not just a rubber stamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| We really want to have meaningful dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| We really want to get that critical feedback and then take action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| So once it went back through the working groups, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| We sent it back through the councils again to make sure that we were clear on the feedback that we received and took action that aligned with that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| And then now we're moving toward the implementation piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| Ultimately, the goal for the KCS way is going to be to provide a quality special education user experience, enhanced school support, and increase our student outcomes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1650)|
| 0:27:42| Tonight, we're focusing solely on improving that special education user experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| We recognize that the place where the parents are most often going to interface with our district is in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| And in September, I made the commitment that we were going to design processes and structures to ensure that decisions were being made to those closest to the student, which is our folks in the schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1674)|
| 0:28:04| So that's what we're going to be focusing our attention on this evening for the interim report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| As we started the initiative, one of the most important things was we had to decide who are we as a department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| Not just who are we as a department, who do our principals need us to be, who do our families need us to be as a department, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| So as I go through these core values, again, recognizing that this is not Jason sitting in his office by himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| It's like, man, this would be a cool core belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| This was, again, purposeful work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Multiple voices were at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Where we landed was that in special education, we recognize and respect individual needs, ensure inclusive education, which was a major priority in both the task force and Ms. Henderson's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1717)|
| 0:28:48| We foster collaboration, promote continuous learning and growth, advocate for student success, and ensure accountability and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1728)|
| 0:28:56| And we'll talk more about accountability and transparency later in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Ultimately, these core values are the anchor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| So this is why it's the fundamental first step in this process moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| The core values give us that anchor point, and every decision that we make as a department should be anchored in these values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1748)|
| 0:29:15| If it falls outside of these values, we need to ask ourselves, why would we do it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| So moving forward, our decisions, we want to make sure that we're student-centered first and foremost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| We want to align to these core values, and we want to meet or exceed the law and, of course, adhere to our KCS board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1764)|
| 0:29:35| No roadmap for change is complete without setting high expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Again, in September, I committed to you all that we were going to raise the bar for everybody so that we could set up a path for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| We want to be clear in our expectations for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| I say all the time, it's very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Dr. Reiswick repeats it back to me sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Clear is kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| We have to make sure that people know what is expected of them if they're going to perform to the level that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| So moving forward, we'll talk about some of our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| One of the first pieces that we established was IEP team norms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| These are directly from the adaptive schools model, and the goal here is to establish consistency in our product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| If you go to an IEP team meeting in Region 1, it should feel eerily similar to the experience you're going to have in any other region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| whether it's Region 4, Region 3, whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| So we want to have that consistency in product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| And then also build in a framework where we can foster collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| create that safe space where everybody believes that they're on equal footing and can actively participate in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| And you can see the norms here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| We want to make sure that all discussion is focused in the best interest of the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| That's pretty obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| If we're an IEP meeting, the whole focus should be the kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| All team members will be engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Any team member can request a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Members will refrain from side conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| The team will adhere to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| We'll talk a little bit more about the agenda later in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| All team members will assume positive presumptions, meaning that we're all going to walk in assuming that everyone has the best intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1866)|
| 0:31:15| We're going to go in and assume that there is not malice in the hearts of those who are on this team with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| We will listen to each team member's point of view and allow them to finish before responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| And then finally, we may disagree, but we will always show mutual respect in our words and our actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| So, again, we want to be clear in what's expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| And this is for every team member, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| So whether you're the gen ed teacher, the LEA rep, or a parent, we're all going to adhere and be invested in these norms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1895)|
| 0:31:47| Further in the expectations, again, we want to double down on making sure we're setting up a scenario where our schools can be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| and we're empowering those closest to students to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| So we broke down the expectations moving forward around what should occur before an IEP team meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| what should occur during, and what should occur after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Some of these things will be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Some of these things are just areas where we'd like to see some improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| The first step is we want to know our students, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| So take time to understand what parental concerns may be out there before you show up to the meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| And with that, we want to encourage families to be communicative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Reach out. Let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| What are your concerns so that we can make sure that we're adequately prepared to help problem solve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| This is an example, this next bullet, of us going above and beyond what's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| So in addition to sending an agenda, which is not necessarily required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| we're going to also send a draft IEP to all members of the team 48 hours prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| The requirement is just to the parent, 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| We're saying, let's give it to the entire team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Let's share this agenda so that everyone has ample opportunity to prepare for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| There's a little side note there because when I mention agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| people automatically jump to, like, well, how long is the meeting supposed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| And the answer to that question is that we don't have a policy that dictates how long an IEP team meeting should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| because that would be inappropriate because every child is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Every program for a child is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Therefore, we can't just say every IEP meeting is going to be 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| That would be a misstep, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| So there will be some guidance provided to our school staff as it relates to considering student needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| how many participants, who those participants are, and, of course, the school schedule, teacher schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| and those things would all be variables to be considered when determining what this agenda should look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| So all that goes out 48 hours prior to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| If this next bullet is another change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| again, in the name of empowering our school folks to make these decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| collaboration, if it's wanted or needed, with special education supervisory staff should be done prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| So if you're preparing for this meeting and questions arise, then you need to reach out to the special education staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| whether it's your region facilitator or your region supervisor or the special ed director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| or if, heaven forbid, you can call me, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| But, you know, those contacts should be made ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Again, it goes back to the spirit of, A, being prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| but then also making sure that the people making those decisions are the people most familiar with the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| And then, finally, review documentation and information provided by family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| This was a recommendation that came directly from the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| If parents are taking time to gather documents and information for us to review, like, it's, I mean, review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| Like, you know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Like, they're a valuable part of the IEP team meeting, and we shouldn't make them feel otherwise, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| So if they bring something for our consideration, we should be taking time to review those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2083)|
| 0:34:52| During the meeting represents a pretty significant change for the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| The first four bullets, in fact, will be brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| So I will front load this by saying that there will be training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| and supporting materials provided to our school level staff to help execute this in a way, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| that is not just consistent, but also efficient, because we know that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| we have a finite amount of time, so we want to make sure we're efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| But we're going to begin with introductions and a reminder to call participants by their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| This was another piece of feedback that I actually picked up while I was out doing pulse checks in some IEP team meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| You all may not remember, but I told you I was going to go to meetings, and I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| And one of the things I picked up on was this sort of, like, not taking time to call people by their name, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2132)|
| 0:35:40| Again, everything speaks, and if I think that this is important, I'm probably going to take a beat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| remember your name, and call you by that name as the meeting progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| So that feels like a small thing, but it's a big thing culturally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| because it establishes a setting, again, where people feel like this is an open environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| One of the biggest critiques of the IEP team process is it is this sterile, mundane, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| this happens first, then that happens, and it's not necessarily pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| So how can we create a situation where our families feel more welcome to participate in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| and it starts with something as simple as being purposeful in your introduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Next, we'll review the agenda and our core values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| Again, if we're going to say that we're going to center everything in those values, and they're that important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| then we need to be reviewing those with our families before every meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| to make sure that we're all on equal footing, we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| We're going to review meeting norms and roles so everybody's clear on what is my job during this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| What do I need to particularly attend to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| What do I need to speak to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| And then celebrate successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| This is another one that came from our student, from our special education council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| Celebrate successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| And, man, it like, I'm not super, you know, like, it takes a lot to get to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| but, you know, the way it was broached to me is, like, it would be awesome if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| before we start talking about all the things that impact my child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| if somebody on that team would take some time to talk about the things that they do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Like, what are the things that are going great for my student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| Before we ever get into that final bullet of the procedural rights and safeguards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| which is we already do that because that's a requirement, but that used to be, like, the first thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| So, you know, taking time to talk about the child and the successes that they're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| so that we can start that meeting on a positive note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| And then the final note there on this, because it's the during the meeting piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| So our goal in KCS moving forward is that the school staff is the core of the IEP team from the KCS side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2260)|
| 0:37:49| Special education supervisory staff will be available to attend a meeting upon request from the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| and then approval from the special ed director to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| The important piece here is the bolded part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| The special education supervisory staff will not serve as a local education agency representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2282)|
| 0:38:09| in that meeting, which is the kind of ultimate decision maker for those who aren't clear on that in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| So what that means is, again, it goes back to setting the stage to empower our staff to make these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| and to propose an appropriate IEP in collaboration with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2303)|
| 0:38:32| After the meeting, some of these are new and some of them are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Like, hopefully, bullet number four, for example, implement the IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| It would be my hope that we've already been doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| But some of these are going to be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| And this is, again, about putting ourselves in a position to better serve our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| make sure that we have open and consistent communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| So one of the first changes we're making is as the meeting concludes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| staff has created a template so that we can share a contact list with families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| so that if they leave the meeting and all of a sudden they have a question about a particular program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| they've got a reference sheet right there with the contact information for the person they can reach out to to get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| And then, see bullet number two, follow-up on any unresolved questions is expected within two business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| And so this is another one of those points where I think it's important to point out that in looking at the information we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| in the staff input portals across, again, all levels of the organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| our special education council and our student success leadership council, two business days was that sweet spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| And so I think this is, again, this is an expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| It's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| And the feeling is that we can execute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| And the feeling on the family end is that meets their need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| And that's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Ensure all staff have reviewed and signed the IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| Again, that is something that should already have been occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Implement the IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| And then another new wrinkle, back to the accountability piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| we want to make sure that we're spot checking to ensure IEPs are being implemented with accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| So no different than, you know, if you're a principal and somebody calls and is like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| hey, my English teacher isn't teaching the English curriculum, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| That principal is going to go and they're going to check and they're going to be like, no, sure enough, that's the English curriculum, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| We want to make sure we're doing the same thing when we have families with concerns around their IEPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| Somebody should be able to speak to whether or not the IEP is being implemented with accuracy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| So we want to make sure that we're very purposeful in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| And then finally, we want to formalize support for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| I've already talked about clear being kind, so we're having those clear expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| setting a clear roadmap forward for how these IEP processes will work moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| One of the biggest shifts is the shift in central office focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| We're no longer going to be running into these meetings and leading meetings for IEPs or evaluations or whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2449)|
| 0:40:58| We're shifting this focus now toward instruction and programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| which will only benefit our students because we're putting people on the ground to support our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| and make sure that we have quality programming and quality supports for the staff in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| We're going to have increased bandwidth by making this shift where we're prioritizing school-based decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| as opposed to top-down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| Finally, we're going to continue to work with talent acquisition and also leverage the ESS contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| I will take another opportunity to thank this board for passing the ESS contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| because overwhelmingly in those staff input portals, it came up over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| We've got to make sure that we're adequately staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| And bless them, they're not asking for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| They're asking for us to be able to fill what they should already have, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| So that's been a huge tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Our Student Success Advisory and Improvement Officer, you guys were introduced to her last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| That's Chelsea Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| She has hit the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| She's prioritizing her time currently learning the processes and functions within KCS so that she can be familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| It's really hard to start recommending changes or areas of improvement if you're not really firm on what's actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| So she's been getting out into schools, attending various meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| She's also already started in the advisory component as it relates to anything that we believe could end up being litigious or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2535)|
| 0:42:24| The reason that's an important staff support is that gives us that quick hit on when we need that quick advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| on whether it's wording for something or whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| That's already bearing fruit, so really excited to have Chelsea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| She had her eyes on these products as well and provided her input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| And then finally, our Special Education Family and Community Liaison, Ms. Sue Ownby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| I can't give her a big enough shout out, but the key here is we've got to make sure that we're building more mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| so that families can easily gain access to what that role does in terms of sharing information and educational opportunities for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2575)|
| 0:43:05| We've got to do a better job of setting the stage, advertising when she's having events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| and again, just an easier way to get access to that resource is going to be a big part of the support as well moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2590)|
| 0:43:19| Next steps, so as I said, none of this stuff, things don't happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| Meaningful change takes time, and it should take time if you want it to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| If you rush it, it just falls apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| So beginning now, principal and staff training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| Principals will be trained at our next principals meeting, which I can't recite the date to you, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| And I apologize for panicking, but I believe it's next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| And then our central office shift toward instructional programmatic support is happening immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| School leaders serving as LEAs in the IEP process, as opposed to central office staff, will begin as soon as we get our principals trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2629)|
| 0:43:58| And this note is just another point of clarity, again, with what that role of the local education agency rep is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2638)|
| 0:44:07| In the event of disagreement, the LEA has the ultimate authority to make the final decision for what will be included in the proposed IEP, not the actual IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2647)|
| 0:44:16| The district's obligation is to propose an appropriate IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| It doesn't become the IEP until everybody, including the parent, agrees with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| In addition, we're also rolling out two RFPs that if they didn't go out today, they're going out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2665)|
| 0:44:33| One of those will be for us to obtain a technical assistance partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| The goal with this particular RFP will be to give us partnership to assess the state of special education in KCS, identify bright spots and areas of opportunity for improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2678)|
| 0:44:49| and then ultimately inform the development of a five year strategic plan for special education in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| And then the second RFP is going to be for programmatic support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| This ties, again, back to recommendations from the Special Education Task Force as well as our resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| This list of possible topics and supports is not exhaustive, but here's kind of broad strokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| Additional training on free and appropriate public education, least restrictive environment and inclusive practices, modified content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2714)|
| 0:45:23| which I know we've made some progress in that area specifically with some of our supporting documents to help staff and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| But again, continuous improvement. We want to continue to improve in that area, so that'll be an area that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2731)|
| 0:45:39| The overall special education continuum, what is it that Knox County has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Are there holes in our services that perhaps need to be filled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Specific, more in-depth training on the Tennessee Department of Education Special Education Framework, co-teaching, and then facilitating IEP meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| Again, that list is not exhaustive, but it does hit some of the high points and areas of focus from the Special Education Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2755)|
| 0:46:05| In the coming months, one of the things that I definitely heard loud and clear over the months leading up to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| is we've got to find a way to be more transparent and have improved communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| So we need to have more frequent communication, and that communication needs to be quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| And if we do it, we need to say we do it, and this is how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| So we're going to launch a monthly newsletter in February for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| The intent there will be to share relevant updates, information, and resources for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| And then a new and improved web presence that will launch hopefully around the spring break mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| And I know that sounds like a long time, but it is a genuine overhaul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| And one of the biggest pieces that I know folks have been asking for is very clearly and easily accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| overviews and explanations of our special education teams, programs, and services with relevant contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2816)|
| 0:47:04| An FAQ page for families as it relates to the IEP team process and how do you navigate those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2824)|
| 0:47:12| And of course then the next bullet, and if the FAQ doesn't work, an easily accessible portal to submit questions and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2832)|
| 0:47:20| directly to the Office of the Ombudsman, which would ultimately go to our special education family and parent liaison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| Again, trying to be more efficient in helping our families get the supports that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| because ultimately that's our goal here, to make sure that our families and our students have what they need to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| And then finally there will also be a portal there for families to have access to the modified content resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| And that is it. Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| Any questions? I did have several questions, but you answered them in the next steps part of the presentation, so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2870)|
| 0:47:59| I think it's good to see a plan, which is always important, but a plan, is it meaningful without that implementation piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2879)|
| 0:48:08| So thank you for going through all the next steps. I'm looking forward to seeing them rolled out to our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2888)|
| 0:48:17| Oh, I'm sorry, someone did have a question. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Myers, I don't have a question, but did want to just say I appreciate the focus on the little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| what some people perceive to be the little things. You mentioned several times about kind of setting the right culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| Things like setting a set of core values, but also continuing to go back to those and make sure that they're not just something on paper and in print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2915)|
| 0:48:44| So to me, I have a lot of confidence in the work that you're doing, because it's not just sweeping changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| It's also looking at the minutia and saying, how can we make these little iterative tweaks that add to the role culture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| So I appreciate that and appreciate the work of everybody that you brought into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| Those are the types of things that often get missed when you look top down, right? You only start to see those things when you look bottom up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| And so I appreciate everybody's elevated their thoughts and feedback as part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2947)|
| 0:49:21| That's sort of how we've approached this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| Just to echo that, I would like to thank you and also the members of the Advisory Council for agreeing to serve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2967)|
| 0:49:37| I know that's not always easy. I am very hopeful, because a lot of what I see and miss seems like it will address the concerns that I frequently hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| So I am very appreciative of that and just excited to see how this evolves over the next few months. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=2984)|
| 0:50:05| Thank you, Madam Chair. I was afraid I was going to go way off in the weeds, but Mr. Watson gave me a jump in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3005)|
| 0:50:14| So I'm going to start from there. I really appreciate also the small details that we don't really think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| Several of the things that you mentioned, I've talked to past staff about multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| And, for example, using the names and celebrating the successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| I talked to a parent several years ago who was in tears because of the stress of going to an IEP meeting and knowing that it was all going to be what her child couldn't do when her child had spoken that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3036)|
| 0:50:51| And that was the first time. But that wasn't going to be talked about at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| And when I've talked about that with past staff, it's always been, oh, that's too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| That was the last anything happened. So I greatly appreciate that it's been recognized and that there's been an effort to look at that and bring it up to the surface as important. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3064)|
| 0:51:19| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Myers, for your work and all of those who are working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3079)|
| 0:51:26| I think that, and I'm looking at Jennifer, Ms. Owen's screen, we look forward to continuing to increase transparency and improve communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3086)|
| 0:51:36| Because I heard loud and clear from a lot of parents that it was, they didn't always feel like they were heard and it was pushed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| I think it's important to include parent support and the investment program as early as possible to be able to navigate this very difficult situation for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3103)|
| 0:51:56| So I look forward to that being a growing piece. And we are always going to be continuing to look and see how we can be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3116)|
| 0:52:06| Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate I'll join what the board has already said and just expressing my appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| And and I know it's taken a lot to get to this point. I appreciate the thorough presentation to us and and the presentation that you'll do for principals next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| I know it will take some time to have such a massive, I think about the Titanic turning and how slowly things take to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3140)|
| 0:52:31| So I'm sure that that will be frustrating for you as we go along, because it will be a lot slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| I hope it's not. But but I know it will be. I know you'd like for it to change overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| So I know it'll be slower than we'd like to see it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| But I appreciate the the detail, the details in the plan and pushing forward to make sure that we do get to that culture change that where parents feel appreciated and heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3168)|
| 0:53:01| So thank you. I did have one question. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| I know that Hamilton County, I believe it's Hamilton County, really turned around their culture with special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| Have you guys reached out to other districts to see what their best practices are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| Yeah, we've had some conversations that that special ed director works very closely with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| So Dr. Adams and I have had some conversations. He was really intricate in the work that happened at Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| I think it was a three year strategic plan. Yeah. We reviewed those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| But yeah, Dr. Loy has reached out to the other large districts in the state to see what you know what they're doing in some of our areas that sort of rose to the top as priority areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| The one that comes to mind first is modified content. It was such a it was such a issue that was discussed at public forum, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| Yeah. And so we've definitely been reaching out to the other large districts to to, you know, see what see what we can learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| I don't see any other questions. Thank you so much, Mr. Myers and your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3242)|
| 0:54:13| Dr. Adams, we have a we have a very robust agenda this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| We do, Madam Chair, members of the board. Thank you. And I can assure you the work that we started at Hamilton County pales in comparison to what I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3259)|
| 0:54:27| I'm like, oh, that's where you came from. Yes. Yes. We started at Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| And I can assure you, Mr. Myers and his team, they've done an exceptional job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| So I commend them on their work that they're doing and very excited for the exceptional education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| So I would like to get through this as quickly as possible to get to the actual Farragut solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3279)|
| 0:54:50| I know it is greatly anticipated, but I do think it's important that we do a recap and share the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| And so FY 21 in the capital plan, there was a feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| And what we garnered from that study was basically any construction on the campus of the Farragut Intermediate, Farragut Middle School and Farragut Primary would be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3301)|
| 0:55:10| A lot of reasons because it's landlocked. So when you look at removing portables, doing additions to any facilities on the current campuses and, you know, it becomes not cost effective and also time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3310)|
| 0:55:25| And it also creates some issues on the campus itself as far as students and faculty and staff and parents being able to navigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| On September 20, 2023, the board approved the property on Boring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| And again, I'd like to thank Miss Horn, Commissioner Schoonmaker, Mayor Williams with the town of Farragut, Doug Shover, my facilities director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3338)|
| 0:55:50| They were all intricate parts in landing that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| And I'd also like to thank Doug Horn for actually selling us that property for below value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| And so we were very fortunate to get that property and excited that we were able to secure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| And I'd like to thank the school board for voting on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| So the challenges, once again, we talked about portables being an issue on all of the campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| That's the Farragut Intermediate, Middle, Farragut High School and Farragut Primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| Overcrowding at our elementary schools and our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| We shared that information at our last presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| And also traffic congestions at all campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| So on October 4, 2023, the board voted for the property on Boring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| October 26, we presented to the board some possible solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| And again, I would like to revisit that presentation we shared with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| That was a very thinking outside of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| Because what we knew, we were moving forward with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| And we were talking about building an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| And so when I stepped into this position, my first question was, what about the middle school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| What about the high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| And do we have enough for future growth for our elementary schools with building one elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| And so what we wanted to do is propose some thought-provoking solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| And include not only the board, but to set out and get the proper input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| So on November and December of 2023, we went out for the community presentations and feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| And we garnered a lot of feedback from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Those meetings were very powerful and purposeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| And I would like to thank the administration at the primary, intermediate, middle and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| They were all an intricate part of those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| And so we took that information, and I'll share with you some of that information and the decision we have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| And tonight, of course, is a presentation with our solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| And the 2025-2026 tentative date, again, that is tentative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| We all know construction is challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| But that is a tentative date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| And on the 26-27, we would love to see our doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| But again, we have the board vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| Of course, we have the design of the new build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| We have the construction of the new build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| There's a bid process that's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| And just the delays in construction itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| So just a quick recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Option one was to build a new elementary school, K-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| Option two was the Farragut Primary would remain a K-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| Option three, I'm sorry, not option, option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| Farragut Intermediate School remains a 3-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| And Farragut Middle School and Farragut High School, there are no changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| This, again, was the original proposal to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| Option two, we talked about building a new middle school, converting the Farragut Primary School through a K-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3517)|
| 0:58:44| Converting the Farragut Intermediate School would expand into a K-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| It would be a much larger school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| And then we would utilize a portion of that school for the Freshman Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| Option three was to build a new K-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| The Farragut Primary would be converted into an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| There would be no changes to the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| And a portion of the middle school building would then be converted to the Freshman Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| So we had three community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| We had approximately anywhere from 30 to 35 in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you, Reverend Butler, for being a part of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| Out of those meetings, we did a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| And there were 396 respondents to that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| And then we did another survey, which I will go into, which we had 688 responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3568)|
| 0:59:36| What we received, some information we received, 32% out of 118 responses said that they wanted to provide future growth across all Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3576)|
| 0:59:47| 31.5% out of 115 responses said they would like to keep the number of students at each school as low as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| So the feedback from the community were concerns regarding traffic on Boring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| A desire to keep the middle school within walking distance of the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| And this is something that, this was a common theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| And being a former middle school and high school principal, I completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| Because you do have students at the middle school who do access advanced courses at the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| There were interests in a dedicated space for the Freshman Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| But concerns about option two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| But concerns about option two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| And just a quick recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| The ninth grade students on a shared campus with the elementary students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| The ninth grade students' sense of connection to the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| So that was another concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| That if they were on a designated campus, would they be connected to the high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| And a request for a Freshman Academy annex on the high school, Farragut high school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| So they wanted a separate campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| But if they had a separate campus, they wanted it in close proximity to Farragut high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| There was another suggestion that was brought to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| And that was for grades K4, 5.6, 7.9, and 10.12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| So the town of Farragut has conveyed to us, we've had multiple meetings again with the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| And Mayor Williams, they have something going on with their traffic where they can control the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| And he has assured us that they will be able to control some of that traffic and the congestion in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| And also, when we construct the new campus, we will have a separate line for car riders and bus drop-offs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| So the construction of that campus will make it to where it's not problematic and we don't have a backup on Boring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| The K-5 was to maximize the building capacity because of the student-teacher ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| I will tell you, when you look at a K-5 on the Farragut primary school, what that looks like is you get two additional classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3702)|
| 1:01:49| The student ratio is different when you talk about a primary school and an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3709)|
| 1:01:58| And so that is another benefit to converting over from a primary to an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| And this is just some of the research that we looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| Transitions between schools can increase student stress, anxiety, resulting in a reduction in student confidence and engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| Students struggle with frequent changes in authority and school expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| Parent involvement is tougher on families when students are enrolled in multiple schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| Students benefit from access to older student mentors and potential for learning loss when environment is not conducive to maintaining consistent expectations and academic goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3747)|
| 1:02:38| So when we looked at the multiple transitions, this is something that we realized that could be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| There is one school that I reached out to that has multiple transitions and they are currently in the process of running back to a traditional schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3763)|
| 1:02:52| So based on the findings, we returned to the community one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| So basically the input that I received, I thought I would put some more work on Ms. Lautner and her team and just say, can we give it one more time, one more chance and go to the community and reach out to the community and get some additional input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3777)|
| 1:03:11| And that's where we received 688 responses, which is compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| And so what you see there is 72% of the respondents were either in favor of a K-5 model or expressed no preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3797)|
| 1:03:25| And so as you can see, the K-5 model was popular across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| You had 378 community members who were interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| And then you had for the primary intermediate, you had 142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| And you had no preference at 168.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| But this is where we asked to dig a little deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| And so of course the comms department did a stellar job in identifying what families with students in those grades were looking for those particular schools or school models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3826)|
| 1:04:00| And so 264 out of those, the pre-K through 5, out of the 264, 99 and 107, what you're looking at are families with students pre-K to the 5th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3840)|
| 1:04:14| If you look at 6th through 12th, you had, again, it was the popular vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| And these are families who had students in the 6th grade to the 12th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| And again, it was popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| And this is compelling as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Even though they're secondary families with students who are in 6th grade through 12th, what we realized quickly having conversations with parents is they had students in the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3865)|
| 1:04:37| They had students in the intermediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| They had students in the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| And so just to hear their stories and their concerns and these results don't surprise me, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| I had a conversation way before the data came out with Ms. Lautner and her team, and I said, I predict this is what it would look like just because of the conversations that I had with the families in the community sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3886)|
| 1:04:59| So again, a heartfelt thank you to the community families at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| I certainly appreciate the time that we were able to meet with you all, get your feedback, make a sound decision on how we move forward to support your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| It was greatly appreciated, and I can assure you every bit of that information, along with my team, was used to come up with the best solution for the schools at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3914)|
| 1:05:27| So our KCS solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| What we decided to bring before the board is to construct a K-5 elementary school on Boring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| The programmatic capacity would be 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| The approximate cost would be $47 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| We plan to come back before the board to ask for renovations to the primary, intermediate, and middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3946)|
| 1:05:55| And that is to do a conversion over to the K-5 elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| And so we plan on asking for a fund balance designation to give programmatic capacity for the Farragut primary school, which would be a new elementary school of 753 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3960)|
| 1:06:13| The programmatic capacity for the Farragut intermediate school, which would be a K-5, 558 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| And approximate renovation and portable removal costs for Farragut middle school, Farragut intermediate school, Farragut primary school, which will all be elementary schools, minus the middle school, of course, at a tune of $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3979)|
| 1:06:32| We will explore possible and future freshman academy additions on Farragut high school, and that is something that we will continue to look at as far as down the road, what makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=3992)|
| 1:06:44| And so, again, we will go through the same process. We'll get input from administration, the community, the school board, of course, and move forward down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4004)|
| 1:06:55| But we really needed to answer the call as to how we address the needs at the elementary level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| So this solution provides for the smallest possible school sizes while creating capacity for growth across all Farragut elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4022)|
| 1:07:11| It maintains the middle school proximity to the high school, which, again, this is something that the community of Farragut really asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4031)|
| 1:07:21| It reduces the number of school transitions for students, and it addresses traffic concerns related to Boring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| And, again, I would like to mention our conversations with Mayor Williams and his willingness to alleviate any traffic concerns that they currently have with the light situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4046)|
| 1:07:40| And, of course, the construction of the new campus, we would certainly design that campus to where we can assist in alleviating any traffic concerns on Boring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4060)|
| 1:07:51| So, January, we want to communicate the plan with the families for the three K-5 elementary schools to the Farragut families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4071)|
| 1:08:02| In February, again, we would like to come back to the board, and we would like to reclassify the Farragut primary schools into a Farragut intermediate school and, excuse me, primary and intermediate school into a K-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4082)|
| 1:08:16| This would go along when we're doing the construction. I would like to keep that in mind, that that transition would happen almost simultaneously to the opening of the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4096)|
| 1:08:26| This would cost us about $3 million to renovate the primary, the intermediate, and the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| Spring of 2024, we'd like to move forward with the design process for the new K-5 using the approved money in the capital budget currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4112)|
| 1:08:41| And looking ahead, again, we would like to explore possible future additions of Freshman Academy at Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| And this, once again, I'd like to say this is a process that we will do as we look at all of our solutions for every community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| This is something that it was very interesting meeting with the families to hear their responses, and one of the questions was, yeah, you're listening now, but are you listening, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4136)|
| 1:09:07| So clearly we're listening, and this process, this is what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| We want to ensure that my team works very closely with the community to ensure that we are addressing the needs of all communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| And as we move forward for any new construction, this is the process that we have established, and this is the process that we are going to adhere to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4159)|
| 1:09:27| and this is the process as we go into different learning communities that we will do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| So I know I went through that fairly quickly, but please, if you have any questions, please share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4172)|
| 1:09:40| Ms. Horan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Thank you for all the time and effort that you and the staff, and there's been so many, I was thinking about it on the way here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| there's so many staff members that have been involved in this process, so I don't want to name names because I'll forget people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| but I appreciate everybody that has spent time on it, particularly those of you that came out to Farragut and spent a lot of time there with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4195)|
| 1:10:06| There's a lot of the community members here that were at all of those meetings, so thank you all for being here and for the engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| I think that this process has gotten us to a better solution because we have had so much community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4213)|
| 1:10:22| and I appreciate the surveys also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| I think it's really interesting to look at, and that's very instructive to look at the surveys to see what families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| particularly families that are in that situation now and families that even are past that time frame with their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| And so I appreciate that you took all those concerns and all that feedback into account with this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| and I think it'll be a great plan. It addresses the concerns of getting rid of the portables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| and making sure that we have enough space to programmatically offer what we need to to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| And so I look forward to going forward with the design phase so that we can get this underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| and again, it's going to take so much time, but at least we're moving in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| and so thank you again for all the work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| As well, for you and your team and all the work that's been happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| I've got a couple of just technical questions to make sure I'm understanding things correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| So the combined capacity for all three elementary schools would be roughly 2,500, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| And then what would the capacity end up being at the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| and I don't know what the current capacity is at the high school. I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Do you roughly know what the capacities are at the middle school and high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| So the capacity at the middle school is roughly 1,500 to 1,600,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| and at the high school, we're close to capacity now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| We are adding additional classrooms with the innovative school grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| so we do have room for capacity at the high school now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| I'm not very familiar with the area of Farragut, other than when I drive through there for retail reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| Are there kids that would be zoned for any of these elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| that would automatically go to a different middle school or high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| or is every kid that's zoned at one of these three schools now going to that same middle school and high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| That's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| Every student who's attending Farragut schools will attend Farragut Middle School and Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| And then my last question is, on the slide that talks about the $3 million renovation to Farragut Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4353)|
| 1:12:41| and the other two schools, what's going to be happening at Farragut Middle School other than removing the portables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| Is there any other parts of that renovation at the middle school specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| So mostly for the restrooms at Farragut Middle School, those will be renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| and that is something that has been on the books for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| and so it will be a total renovation when you look at fixtures within those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| So it will be mostly fixtures, up to grade, and restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| So with the middle school renovation, are we going to be losing capacity then because we're taking away portables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| No, so currently the middle school, they do not utilize portables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| Okay, they don't utilize portables. So the portables are only at the other two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| Yes, the portables are utilized by the intermediate school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| and so they will not lose any space whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for all the good work you and everyone has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| I did have the opportunity to visit one of the community events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| and I was really excited about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| and I really believe just seeing the process that was going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| that Knox County School was doing a good job of listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| I commend Board Member Susan Horne for her hand on the pulse and continuing to work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| and I think it's a great example for, as you say, going forward for all of the different learning communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4447)|
| 1:14:14| I'm excited about what might be happening in the Canada Lonsdale Beaumont area in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| But I really like the fact that we heard a lot from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| and we, I think, listened, and I think that's the process we really need to make sure we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Mr. Watson, I also asked a question about capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| and I think the numbers that we have currently in Farragut Primary and Intermediate is just under 2,100 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| So this allows capacity for 400 plus additional students in those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4487)|
| 1:14:56| And just so everybody knows, the other portables that are in the Farragut realm are at the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| There are several portables at the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| and so that's something that they'll be looking at going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| because that needs to be addressed also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| I just want to thank you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| I know we went through this recently with Mill Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| There's a lot of growth in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| and so I want to thank you for everything you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| I see many Farragut friends out in the audience tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| so thank you for not only showing up tonight, but for being involved in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| I'm really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| I think this whole process has been a true partnership between KCS and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| so I'm really excited to see this going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| And you're up next for custodial staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Do you want to stay there, or where would you like to give that report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| We'll see how I'm up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| So we currently have 69 openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Again, we continue to reduce the amount of openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| I'm not excited about where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| I'd love to see that number be zero, but we are making some progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| and we have approximately six schools that exceed 50% or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| I will say on January 2nd, we did have a custodian professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| where we recognized our custodian with a luncheon and some door prizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4577)|
| 1:16:24| And so that was exciting to have an opportunity to spend that time with our custodians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| and really just show how much we appreciated them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| And everyone had a great time, and we had enough food for seconds and thirds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| and so they were excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| And I got the burning question, will we continue to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| And I said, yes, this will be an annual thank you to their custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| That's a cool idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Any questions for Dr. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| Thank you, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| That's a lot of good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| Mr. Triplett, do you have a legislative update for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Briefly, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| I have a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| I'm sure we'll have a lot going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| The legislative session starts this week, so that kicks off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| so I'm sure there will be a lot of things that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| One of the things you all received last month in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| was a legislative toolkit from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| There's a section there called Issue Briefs that kind of explain their position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| which I thought was very interesting and informative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| more than just kind of the brief one-liner statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| It had a little more detail to it and kind of their position on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| So it will be worth a read as we look at what comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| and kind of where they stand on some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| that we'll probably be seeing in the legislative session this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| That is it, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| Board members, would you all want to take a break before we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| like a five, ten-minute break before we get into the now second agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| Okay, why don't we take a ten-minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| and then we'll come back at, what time is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| 6.30. Let's come back at 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240108?start=4679)|
