| 0:02:00| One of the comments I'll make just right off, after the first six items I think, items seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=120)|
| 0:02:08| through thirty-four are offered by the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| A large number of items, I'm not pulling any, I just wanted people to realize that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| is a large portion of this evening's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| I'd like to add a discussion item if Mr. McKenzie, I think he, of the school, our joint school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=146)|
| 0:02:34| meeting we had last month, go ahead and add that as a discussion item for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=154)|

| 0:02:45| and of County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| Also, as we look through the agenda, item thirty-six should be moved to full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=169)|
| 0:03:03| no recommendation, the contract is not complete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=183)|
| 0:03:20| Are there other items, are there any other items that should be pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| Let me back into consent that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| That's going to make the items that are before us, that are in the printed agenda, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| be placed on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=218)|

| 0:04:46| Ms. Black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| We would like to add a commission item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| It would be a resolution for the Knox County Public Library to contribute twenty-five thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| dollars to the Knox County Public Library Foundation for the Papers to Pixel project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=297)|

| 0:05:23| Commissioner Busler, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| I was wanting to have a couple of discussion items of consent pulled off so we can discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| it at the next meeting if we could at the general, I guess, I want to pull it off consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| agenda to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Okay, you're not going to discuss today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=347)|

| 0:06:03| for the school funding to see what, some questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=363)|
| 0:06:20| Is that the only two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=380)|

| 0:07:19| Yes, and I don't know if I need to add a discussion item, but I guess, yes, I'd like to add a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| discussion item on the new style of the school consent agenda, the school recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=446)|
| 0:07:38| or resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| I just want to discuss the volume and the amounts of the award, just have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| item about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=469)|

| 0:08:00| Seeing no other lights, I would like to ask for a motion that all that's to be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=480)|

| 0:08:14| Commissioner Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| I was looking at some old notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=495)|

| 0:08:47| Mr. Chairman, I think we need to be careful on our discussion here, because you've sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| what you've said is consent, and then you've got the printed page, but you've got all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| additions I'll have to be voting on today to be added, so I'll make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| add what needs to be added, withdraw what needs to be withdrawn, and set the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| minus the withdrawals on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| But today's added items cannot be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=549)|

| 0:12:43| Will this require additional staffing for this particular grant also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| And how many staff will it require additionally if it does require additional staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=768)|

| 0:13:41| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| My question is not about the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| The money has been moved around and it's all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| It's about the project itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| The projects went from a $7 million project to a $10 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| And I understand that part of the problem is there's rock on the site that raised it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| $1.8 million, getting us to $8.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| I was kind of curious as to why the project hasn't increased so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| Mr. Oaks, Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=856)|
| 0:14:34| Doug Dillingham, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| Commissioner, we budgeted upon GAAP about three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| And in that time, we have gone through a transition when we were actually looking at the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=884)|
| 0:14:54| of the facility, the addition especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| We determined that there were a lot of items in there that would require some fairly large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| expenditures to temporarily set up utilities that would later be taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| And we decided that was not the best expenditure of the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| So we went through a redesign process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| Now, the current budget is based on we put this on the streets and bid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| And based on the bid environment right now, the actual low bid that we received was $8.145 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=922)|
| 0:15:32| That did not include what is anticipated another million dollars worth of rock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| that would have been taken out by unit prices that we had asked for as a part of the construction bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=938)|
| 0:15:48| So that has a lot to do with where we are right now from a budget standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| Okay. Now, the project has not been re-bid yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Not at this point, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Once we have the approval to put the funding in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| we will revise documents and put it out on the streets and re-bid it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| Do you feel fairly confident that what you have budgeted here will pass through the re-bid process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| and come in at or below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| I have my fingers crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| In a bidding environment the way it is right now, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| this is the best estimate that we can put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| and it is based on the prices that we got in May on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| The two schools that are fixing to be built, the schools supplied those estimates also, did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Okay. How recent are those figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Those budgets were put together this past year, within the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| Okay. So you don't anticipate any of the escalation because of contract or demand into these schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| I really can't answer that question without having a school designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| and seeing what the actual construction is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| I have every confidence that the manner that this is being done right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| that, you know, they'll design a good school and we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| As far as pricing is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| I wouldn't bet the ranch on anything at this point in time the way things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Doug, don't run away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| We're not done with you yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| I think I can kind of use a little ESP and kind of read Commissioner Smith's mind here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| in the fact that I don't think any of us want to see another Hardin Valley as far as cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| Normally when somebody goes in to build, when they get an estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| there should be at least enough investigative work done to kind of know what the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| and kind of what's around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| So to add another million and a half or whatever we're talking about here just to get rid of a few rocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| evidently somebody didn't look too good, did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| Commissioner, we did a subsurface investigation on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| That was done by the architect and the civil engineer that was used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Typically what we try to do is we ask for the subsurface investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| and ask the professionals doing the design to give us some type of a guesstimate on anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| of what we will find down below and include that in some allowances and unit prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| So there were some allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| As a matter of fact, on the $8.145 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| we had about $130,000 worth of allowances built in for subsurface based on unit prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| And the way we do it is we ask the contractor to give us a unit price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| and we give them a quantity to include in the base bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| And the quantities that are included are based on recommendations from the subsurface investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| subsurface engineer, and the civil engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| So I can't tell you what happened on this one other than the fact that there were a lot of this rock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| and I understand that Commissioner Smith played on those rocks as he was growing up and going to school there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| but a lot of them were in wooded area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| We did have the research done and the information was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| that solid rock is down probably about eight feet or so underneath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| between five and eight feet underneath the surface at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| But in some instances we have a cut required that goes 12 and 14 feet deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| so that's just a lot of rock to try to take out that we were not anticipating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| It seems like, though, you can move a lot of rock for a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| It's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| Commissioner Orenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Thanks, Doug, for sticking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| I didn't want you to have to walk back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| I'm glad to see that this is coming, moving further, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| But we've been here before on this pond gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| I'd like to see it be done, and I kind of worry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| kind of like what Commissioner Brown kind of related to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| that by approving a dollar amount, people tend to spend exactly that dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| I'd almost rather have a bid in first and then we kind of go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| I'm just, you know, Hardin Valley was kind of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| We approved it at a certain dollar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| and any builder is going to build and use every penny he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| I'd like to see it get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| It needs to be done, but I don't want to see this cost continue to go up to $13,000, $15,000, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1278)|
| 0:21:31| I'd like to see it be done, but I'd like it to be done as cost effectively as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1291)|
| 0:21:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| So, Doug, let me see if I got this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| We've got $1.8 million for rock and $1.2 million for design changes and escalating contractor costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1305)|
| 0:21:57| Commissioner, to me that's kind of oversimplifying it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| We put together a budget three years ago that has proven that it was not a sufficient amount of budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| based on what is happening in the construction environment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| The budget that we're bringing to you right now is based on the actual cost that a contractor has given us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| plus the fact that we have gone through and tried to take a look and massage some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1345)|
| 0:22:34| For instance, trying to see if there are measures we can take to stay out of some of the rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| Part of what's happening here is we're adding on to an existing facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| so you already have a floor level that is established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Typically, out in the real world, the first thing you do if you hit solid rock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| is see if you can raise the floor level with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| You can only do that to a certain extent when you're adding on to an existing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| So we're looking at any measure that we possibly can to save as much money as we can on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| But the budget we've put together right now is based on some actual dollar figures that we got through the bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1385)|
| 0:23:14| Identifying 1.8 for rock or whatever the case may be, it could be increasing steel prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1394)|
| 0:23:23| It could be increasing any type of material that you put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| There are additional design fees that will be involved in going through a rebid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| so that's included in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| Thank you, Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| One pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| One pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Mr. Holt, continuing on to item 47, right after that there is an item to be added concerning item 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1436)|
| 0:24:11| Hugh, would you come for just a moment and give us about three sentences on what this will be before us next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1451)|
| 0:24:25| And first I would look for a motion of no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| Is this on number 47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Whatever it is he's adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Commissioner Wright, Bud Armstrong has that resolution in front of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| But what it is is it is the actual funding mechanism for 47, which is our phase two of the Knox County Energy Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1481)|
| 0:24:50| Does it have an item number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| No item number yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Again, I ask for a motion to send no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Has it been added to the agenda yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| I think that was part of what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| That's what he did earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| He was the first to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I'll make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| He was the first to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Motion is properly before us to send a full commission, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1513)|
| 0:25:21| I think the next to add that we had was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| It is properly before us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| I was looking down at the next add, which was 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| If there's no discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| This is a resolution to be added regarding the $25,000 for the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1565)|
| 0:26:16| I'll make a motion to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| Does anyone want to speak any further to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| As I understand, the resolution is $25,000 to move...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Finish your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Has any of this paperwork been submitted to the law director's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| Or to Jill Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| No, we will get that to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| It's basically just an approval to expend funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Usually when anything over $10,000 has to come before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| this one's kind of unique in that it's the library foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| So it's kind of unique, but we thought we would bring it anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| because it's for their paper-to-pixels campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| I'd like to make a substitute motion to be sent without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| I'll withdraw mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Yeah, just so we can kind of stay consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Who was the second on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Jeff was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| We'll draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| We'll go with Sam's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| We'll go with Sam's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Commissioner McKenzie's motion is to forward to full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| no recommendation, properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| McKenzie's, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Amy Broyles, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Thanks, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Marietta, I was just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| are all the commissioners familiar with the paper-to-pixel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| Has that been discussed with all the commissioners yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| I believe that every commissioner received a mail-out on that particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| but it's to digitize the Knoxville News Sentinel from 1922 to 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| and it is a fabulous project that will allow keyword searching for anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| who has a library card for any Internet-enabled device that they may have anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| So it's a fabulous project and valuable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| It will be owned by us once the project is completed for historical purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| genealogical purposes, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I could just name a long list, but I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| But we're looking forward to it reaching its goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| The project is about $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| The Foundation is working just constantly to secure the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| We're right about $312,000 currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| and we have a challenge match so that these funds will generate an additional $50 toward the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| It is fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| It's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| So I just wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| and up-to-date on exactly what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| What's the deadline for the challenge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| The deadline was 50 days from, I believe, September the 4th, I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| We have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Are we going to be okay for next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Yes, I believe we'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| They do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| No, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Oh, I've already put my money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| It's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| This is the last add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| This is a resolution added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| approving $1.5 million for the economic development relating to the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1766)|
| 0:29:36| We stand with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| I looked that way first and it was off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| All opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| My question for Chris is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| is a week delay going to make a difference on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| If so, I think you need to reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| No, I think the designation wouldn't be approved to full commission regardless, so it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| Those are all the added items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| I believe we're now into discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| This is a discussion regarding the school resolutions, the volume, and the amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| You know, there's good time for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| As we thought about just paying out $25K and $1.5 million here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| I'm sitting here looking at these, and I know there was another legal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| but we're sitting here approving some really piddly sums of money here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| and I don't think this is a way to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| You know, we're talking about, let me pull up a couple of these I circled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| You know, there's some really good ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| but then there's some that $250 to Moreland Heights Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1875)|
| 0:31:24| You're talking about $396 to bringing arts back into schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1884)|
| 0:31:34| $59.20 for Sunnyview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| $750 for other primary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| So we're taking a lot of time and resources, and I know it's things coming to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| and I know the school board's meeting now, but I think this is a reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| I think it's an overreach, and I don't know how we got there, got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| but we shouldn't be voting on these items, even if they are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| I just don't see where this is really helping the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| I mean, we have to trust the school board with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| Either we set a threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| I don't know what the dollar amount is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| but for us to be approving trips to the Smoky Mountains seems a little much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1940)|
| 0:32:33| and if this is going to happen, you know, kind of consistently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1953)|
| 0:32:41| I guess I'm wondering why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| So that's my, and I know we have our, I know we have the consent decree here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| but this is a little much, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| The law department opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| I think right now what the problem is is they're working on some procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| to accept these mini-grants, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| and it's the obligation of this commission to accept all gifts and grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| And we're trying to currently do it like under one resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| that may cover a hundred or, you know, all these little dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| and we're trying to prepare that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| and the school board's working on some form of a procedure to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| where by you'll get one resolution with an attachment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| and it could have 50, 60 little ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| and some total of grant totaling, you know, X dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Then you would get these other big ones, but they hadn't got there yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| so that's why you're getting the little bitty ones independently is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| And Commissioner McKenzie or Commissioner Anders, continuing on schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| Yeah, we, well, I was going to give you the two things that I took away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| from the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| I think we had a meeting, and I can't exactly remember the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| but we met for an hour and a half or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| And two things that I took away from the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| one is that we want to, as a committee and the two legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| get together and talk about things that we can agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| both bodies can agree on, for the state delegation to take forward to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| We feel like it gives us more, gives them more leverage and bargaining power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| if both bodies agree on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| And I think one of those things that we discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| we're going to take more back to them in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| but one of the things we discussed was BEP funding and state-required testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| what kind of testing do we require in regards to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| and why do we keep kind of moving the target on our things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| on our grades, on how we measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| And also the other thing that I took away was we had a great discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| end-of-the-year expenditure of leftover or excess taxes collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| We talked about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Ms. Carson brought up the fact that we have these designations every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| and she wants to know why the schools are not considered in those designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| And so I kind of explained to her that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| anything above the growth in sales taxes is their designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| that $0.72 of every sales tax dollar that they get above and beyond the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| is kind of their designation, so it's already built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| And she kind of thought that was an adequate answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| because they never thought of it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| They didn't have the perspective of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| So that was kind of the gist that I've got of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| I think Sam or Charlie has anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| No, I think you hit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| And to me that's one of the beauties of having the two bodies get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| because Brad's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| There's a perception of reality, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| I think everyone's eyes were kind of opened up when we had the dialogue about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| you've already built in your excess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| and they really either consciously or unconsciously didn't view it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| and thought, well, why can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| that would be getting kind of a double bite at that apple of excess funds collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| And similarly, we, I know last year and more this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| spent a lot of time talking about testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| We're learning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| So, again, a whole lot of these things we'll try to start bringing back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| They're kind of assessing their whole testing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| I guess that's a constant thing that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| So we'll continue to bring the results of these meetings back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Chris has something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Go ahead, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| Just for the record, we actually treat, we call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| it's commitments for designations, fund by fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| So as each fund has a budget surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| then those funds can be designated to be carried over to the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| And schools has brought those in the past for their general purpose school fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| They haven't brought one this year, and I don't think there was one last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| But they have brought those in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| So we view those as fund by fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| And so it's just not as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| So when they're seeing that, they're thinking of it as a whole, but truly fund by fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2247)|
| 0:37:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Just to add to what Brad said as far as an explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| of why they didn't get anything out of the excess money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| today if you add up on the grants that were listed on our agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| that's $1.325 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| If you look at what we budget every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| and at the end of the year you look at what they spend every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| there is a huge difference to the tune of sometimes $40 million, $50 million, $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| So to say we're not getting our share is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Just to kind of play on what Commissioner Andrews and Commissioner McKenzie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| I think we've got some new members and then the board will nominate some new members this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| So our makeup might be a little bit different at our next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| but I think it is we're learning from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| Kind of like what Karen, she didn't understand that, and we explained it to her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| and now she understands why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| So in the same way, vices versus, that's the reason we want to know testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| What are we mandating here that the state's not mandating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Why are we doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| So these are explanations that we're trying to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| and get that better rapport with the two bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| so that we're basically on the same page when it comes to budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| But I think it's been very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I've sat on it for a year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| and I think it's been very helpful to the relationship between us and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2365)|
| 0:39:37| Any further discussion on schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| If not, item 54, if there be no objection, we will receive line item transfers next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2380)|
| 0:39:53| For approval next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Item number 55, discussion regarding rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| There are two items of rural metro that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| I think first we will look at the ambulance question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| that was raised by Commissioner last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| The points that were brought forward were reviewed by the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| modified one sort of a comment more into a form of a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| and those responses have been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| I guess we can read over these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| The question was, how often does rural metro refer 911 calls to other ambulance services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| The response is rural metro has referred 1.11% of 911 requests in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| That's 318 calls out of over 28,000 requests to other county ambulance services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2460)|
| 0:41:09| And that's 318 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Well, I don't know what happened to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| We don't know if they got there in 10 minutes, 30 minutes, two hours, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| That's still 318 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| So I don't know that these questions have been answered entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| And does it count against our 10-minute response time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| The response was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| And using other providers, and they try to use other providers in Knox County first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| was the answer to that question also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| Martha Buchanan, 140 Damron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Just to clarify, one, the contract allows for, not in kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| but for them to refer ambulance calls to other providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| It's not something that would regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Although all of those providers, if you look at the responses, are audited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| and they are also included in those response times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| So we know that an ambulance got there in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Anybody who provides service in Knox County is audited by the state EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| So they got there in 10 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| They're counted in the 10-minute response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| So they're counted against Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| So we know that those runs, what happens with those runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| I mean, I can't dig through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| I don't have exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| But those are counted in the audit that we do every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Did these answers come from Rural Metro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| So they're telling us what they want us to know, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| No, I'm telling you what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| We audit those runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| And my employee and the state EMS folks go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| and they audit all ambulance providers in Knox County every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| So those runs are part of the monthly audits that we do with Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2575)|
| 0:43:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I personally thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| I thank Rural Metro for giving us clear answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| I mean, this was pretty clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| I think we asked them some very poignant questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| And we have to have a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| You have to be measured against something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| And so the state issues the standard on what the qualifications are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| They make allowances because from here to Corrington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| is probably a shorter trip for the folks in Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| potentially as it is to someone here in downtown Knoxville, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| That's just the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| So I would struggle with Granger County responding to Center City Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| But sometimes, you know, those reciprocal calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| And the one question that I was curious about is, okay, do those numbers count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| So if they count in the 10-minute response time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| I guess I'm not understanding what the concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| I think we all agree that we really aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| What does perfection cost, I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| You know, and that's what we have to ask ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| Do we want to fund perfection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| No one does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| So we have to have a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| And that standard has to allow for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| And we set the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| And it sounds like they've met that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| As it relates to the number of calls, we don't want to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| Just like we talked about, we brought up Foster here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| and we were arguing about funding him an auditor to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and verify at a once-per-year level on what we're getting from Hotel Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| So we can't fund the health department to go one-for-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| did this call make an end on time or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| We don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Our taxpayers don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| That's not a wise use of our monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| So we trust, we verify, we audit, and they hear the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2704)|
| 0:45:12| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| It sounds like I'm kind of beating a dead horse here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| So thank you for getting these answers to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| and hopefully we'll continue to get this level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| Like them or not, the answers are the answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| and they're pretty good from my estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| I appreciate getting the answers also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| And they came very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| My only thought was how is the audit held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| You personally audit this, and I respect your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| I trust you that you're doing everything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| It's when you get a call from someone who says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| it took 30 minutes to get to Turkey Creek with a stroke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| It just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| And I know some things happen sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| But we want to get the best care, the best ambulance care that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| And if this is the best we can get, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| In reading the response letter, the last paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| next to the last paragraph invites commission to their location to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| and see and understand how they dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| Just a simple, so between now and next week, next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2806)|
| 0:46:55| because we're going to carry over rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| you need to think about how you want to respond to the last paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| so that we can be fully informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| It would be a trip to the Knox County 911 Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| EOC is the emergency operation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| I want to discuss that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| I want everybody to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Well, I guess we have a question for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| She said that she would be here at the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| I don't think she said the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| So you may want to make sure she's invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| that she'll be here next week as well since we're carrying this conversation over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| I'd hate to have another conversation and they don't show up for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| The conversation we would have is do we want to participate in that last paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| We're not asking more questions of the provider who is under contract to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| We're asking the question of ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| What do we want to do to fully understand how they provide the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| That's a discussion of the people at this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| I would encourage, and we can have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| There's a boardroom over there we can have a great sit-down meeting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| I would encourage the commissioners to go over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| and see the stress that the folks inside that center are under along with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| I mean, rural metro is the sheriff's office and everybody's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| but I would invite you all to go see the CAD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| and see how these ambulances and police and fire trucks are sent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| and the stress that's in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| I would encourage you to go kind of in the evening time when it's a little bit busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| because there's about 400,000 calls a year that come through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| Just when this is wrapped up, I have an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| We have one other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| The other half of the rural metro discussion, this relates to fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2926)|
| 0:48:54| but it's not strictly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Thank you, Ms. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| This does not relate to just rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| It relates to fire protection for the unincorporated portions of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2941)|
| 0:49:10| There was a committee appointed by the chair of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| to review such response to fire and fire protection approximately a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| The commissioners appointed to that committee are myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| Commissioner Thomas, and Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| We met, as noticed, last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| and reviewed some of the notes of the meetings that we had had gathering public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2972)|
| 0:49:42| There were three items that were brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| and I want you to take what we're saying right now as a report from the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| and that we hold this over and discuss it next week if it requires further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| One item that was discussed related to fire hydrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| The discussion that follows fire hydrants is that it's a utility district's business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| of providing utility water and firefighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| One of the questions that was raised about response time and ISO ratings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| and that's related to mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| We also got input from CTAS as it relates to as counties become more populous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3026)|
| 0:50:36| the number of providers decreases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| and we may have seen that over the history of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| And CTAS also offered some models, maybe for continued consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| future needs of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| but nothing was really brought out of that committee of those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| that would be offered by that committee to the whole commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| Knox County is currently serviced by a small number of for-profit or volunteer service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| and they're doing that within certain service areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| And we became aware that each provider has their own business model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| their own customer contact, their own means of being a for-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| or volunteer service provider, fire protection in their areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3090)|
| 0:51:38| I believe what the committee came to, the three commissioners of this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| came to is a view that we did not get a compelling argument or outcry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| from the citizens of unincorporated portions of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| identifying a change or a need that needs to occur in fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| especially in views that there is also no identified revenue stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| to go along with those changes that might be required if commission were to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| By charter, this committee has reached its 12-month or one-year life cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| What commission needs to do is to discuss next week the facts that have come out of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| and determine if there's something else that needs to be done on fire prevention or fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3149)|
| 0:52:37| The two commissioners that were there, I see we're going to have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| Commissioner Bussler, do you wish to add anything to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| Commissioner Thomas? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| You know, I kind of, well, I appointed that committee as the chairman to not look at today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| to look at the future of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| Not one question was asked about apparatus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| What do we have? What do we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| I'll give you an example, just a brief example, and I'll take it upon myself if need be to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| I mean, Chris and Hugh and I are going to go to Chattanooga and look at Hamilton County's model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| But I'll tell you, I mean, give me an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Northwest Knox County is the fastest-growing part of the county, and it has been for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| New buildings, apartment complexes, schools have been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| Manufacturing has been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Distribution has been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Office complexes have been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| There's not a single ladder truck or platform truck on that end of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| Rural Metro has one, but I think it's in another station, maybe Halls or Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| and it's a 20-year-old ladder truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I'm not talking about today when I'm talking about emergency response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| What we have in Knox County is I think we spent $100,000, well, a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| less than a half a million dollars, counting Rescue Squad, Seymour Volunteer, and Carnes Volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| probably $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| We've got 200-something thousand residents outside the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| and I don't know how many residential buildings and commercial dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| And we're sitting here on no funded fire protection in the third largest county in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3266)|
| 0:54:38| Let that sink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| You spent $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| You're the third largest county in the state, and you're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| I think once we have a structure fire on an outlying area, and I know we've got MOUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| and I know we've got the city will respond in some instances and the city comes to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| You have a structure fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Look at Tedford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| It took Rural Metro almost six months to clean that fire up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| You're the third largest county in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| and you spent $300-something thousand dollars on fire protection and emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| counting your Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| If you're thinking about that next week, let that sink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| Mentioning Hamilton County, that is one that CTAS presented as a model that we should look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3325)|
| 0:55:34| and you need to look at it for us and bring us then a report of how they handle fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3334)|
| 0:55:48| Is this trip going to be this week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| No, it won't be this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| It will probably be sometime before Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| Chris and I and Hugh are going to go down and have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I can't remember if it was Chris or Hugh that had a discussion with some of those folks already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| when we did some pricing on the EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| I think the EMS contract is what Hugh said we worked with them on when we did our last bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| It's something we need to look at as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| We're grossly under-sufficient in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| Does that leave us anything to discuss next week, then, if we're going to be looking at this report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| We will have this as a discussion item next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3387)|
| 0:56:35| Commissioner Broyles, I think we've got ourselves down to sort of the announcement end of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| Well, I just wanted to add on to something that Brad said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| is that it's not just our increase in structures and infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3405)|
| 0:56:56| and those sorts of things that are at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| but I would really hate to see us lose any lives because of our deficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| particularly in that part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| So I'm grateful to you and to Chris for making this trip to Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| and I hope that the entire commission will get a report on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| and not just the fire safety group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| I'm very interested in what you learned down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| Well, and don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| Fire safety is one of the things that I'm kind of adamant about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| but it's also the rescue squad and what they provide, the specialty, the trench rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| the fast water rescue, and the more we become urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| becomes big and becomes a vibrant part of our economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| there's already been accidents on the trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| There's going to be more accidents on the trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| We just bought how many acres at IC King Park that has ledges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| We've got cave rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Everything that the rescue squad does, nobody else in this town does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| Trench rescue, even as great as the city of Knoxville Fire Department is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| they call the rescue squad to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| So, yeah, we need to think about what we're not doing in regards to all emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| Commissioner Brules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Yes, I just want to remind everyone and invite everyone to come out tomorrow evening between 5 and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| Mr. Thomas and I are hosting a get-together to listen to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| It's at the Hardin Valley Food City Deli, and they do great hamburgers and great food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| and also the Department of Engineering, Mr. Dwight Van De Veet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| is going to have some people there to talk about the new improvements to Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| which was already started, by the way, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| It was down to one lane going on to Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| And also some of the many changes in that area, and there's a lot of changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| Also, I understand that Terry Hill will be there representing the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| to answer questions about the Hardin Valley Middle School and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| So we hope you'll all come, 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| Also, that same evening, that's at 5, at 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| the Northeast Sector Plan will have its third public meeting at the East Knox Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Yes, I'd just like to announce that Sunday and Monday I will be in Nashville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| at the Tennessee Economic Summit on Women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| I try to attend this every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Unfortunately, it's always on the fourth Monday of October, which always conflicts with our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| So unless there's something on the agenda that needs a no vote from me, I always opt to go to the summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3589)|
| 0:59:58| So that's where I'm going to be on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| and I will pass along everyone's good wishes to all the other women of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| I would also like to say that the Development Corporation met last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| the external audit by Rutherford Moss, and their regular meeting agenda is here on the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| If anyone would like to see the minutes, the meeting of the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| their next meeting is December the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| And then the last item that I have is information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| As I know things, I think you need to know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| On the agenda this month, the last item in zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| the last item in zoning is a Huber property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| There is an e-mail out requesting that that rezoning request be deferred until March of 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3647)|
| 1:00:57| From him or the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| From him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| It is from the developer, but I believe the request is from the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| In any event, the last item on our zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| item number 60 on today's agenda, which we were not discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| the Huber properties rezoning will be requested deferred until March of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3679)|
| 1:01:29| Seeing no further lights, if there be nothing additional to come before commission, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3689)|
| 1:01:57| Roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| Commissioner Brules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Let's have a brief prayer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Almighty God, we come to you to ask you to be with us as we open this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| help us to do what is right for our community and for our public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| Father, we just want you to be with us and guide us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| All this we pray in your name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Could we have the minutes of the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| It has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| The last minutes of the previous meeting that was last year, those rules were never signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| so those are unassigned minutes of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| That's one of the things we need to address, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| We'll have to call another meeting later on in the year to approve the meetings we have tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| so we'll have to have a definite another meeting, which the last year's Rules Committee did not call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| Didn't call a meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Did not call a meeting to approve their minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| Why can't we do it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Because that committee is no longer in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| There's a rule now where the chair of the committee can approve by signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| May approve by signature, and the last year's committee, was that the last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3813)|
| 1:03:40| Well, he can, so yes, the chair of last year, Commissioner McKenzie, can approve those by signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| Well, we'll get Mr. McKenzie to sign that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| If you would, you have some packets that were sent to you that has some of the changes that were suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| and they're in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| If you have questions about why they were changed, we have somebody that can explain that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| The first one is on page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| You'll see it in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| What was added was and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| Do you all see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| The next change comes on page two, and you'll see where it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| the vice chair shall assist the chair in keeping track and order of those wishing to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3876)|
| 1:04:46| Does anybody have any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| The next change comes on page nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3891)|
| 1:05:01| The agenda work session falls on a legal holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| The chair shall convene the commission on a date and time set by the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| In the event of incumbent weather, the county offices in the county building are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| The agenda work session shall be postponed at the direction of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3918)|
| 1:05:28| Does anybody have any questions on that part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| And we changed the down on the Tennessee code amendment amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| You'll see it's gone from 55105 to 55104C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| I didn't get a chance to look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| What was that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| The original 105 told the how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| The 104C tells the who and refers to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| So it adds the who, then it refers you to the how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| So we've started off with the who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| It's just a technical clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| The next change is on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| In the event that a commissioner who is serving on the committee in his or her capacity as a member of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| ceases to be a member of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| then his or her seat on the committee shall be declared vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| and the vacancy shall be filled with a seating member of the commission in the same manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| and by the same authority as the original appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| Do you have questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| Will we wait until that seat is fulfilled to fill that committee seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| Or will we go ahead and just immediately appoint somebody from the remaining body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| I would probably leave that to the discretion of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| It depends on what committee it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| It depends on how often it meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| I think I would leave that up to the case-by-case scenario there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| Well, it has to be another commissioner, so there's no reason the commission can't go ahead and appoint him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| You can either appoint or hold off until you make an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| It depends on what the committee is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| If it's an important committee, you need to reappoint it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| If it's not, maybe the new commissioner can just fill right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| I think it's going to be a case-by-case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Just leave it kind of blank like it is or bland like it is, ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| Is there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| Okay, the last one is on page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| Does the commission want to clarify that this would be a two terms as chair per term on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4059)|
| 1:07:53| or two as a total if you get reelected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| Well, unless it's on another page somewhere, it doesn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| If I'm just reading this as it is, you know, we're talking about a term is four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| This, you can't hold the chair for more than two terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| which to me you could hold it for eight years if you just read it literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| No, it's talking about terms of the chair, not your term as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| But it doesn't designate the term of a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| That needs to be defined as two one-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| Well, it's in the paragraph with the reorganization, which says you should do it annually, select a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| So that's the term of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| Jill, could you re-clarify that a little bit better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| Or do you feel like it's legally clarified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| At the end of two, it just says for more than two terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| but it doesn't say two terms per term on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| So it could be, you know, two years per four-year term as commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| Yeah, I think that would be better, two years per commission term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| Per term as commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Per term as commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| I'd like to make a motion we send these to commission with approval of all the highlighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| Yeah, on this last one, I would have to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| I think, you know, everybody serves eight years, although it looks like some people are going to be serving more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| There's 11 people that serve up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| and I think two years is plenty of time for someone to serve as chair when there's this many talented people who are obviously capable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4178)|
| 1:09:48| and probably would like a chance to have the opportunity to serve as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| So I'm fine with everybody can serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| Whoever wants to serve as chair can serve for two years for their entire eight years that they're up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| I think that's plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| So that's the only one that I have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| Do you want to vote on the amendments separately then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| I'd like to make a motion we send all of the readout amendments to be approved except for the term to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4219)|
| 1:10:30| Let me hear from the law director, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| Amy, I hear what you're saying, but from just a pure legal standpoint with your rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| a commissioner has one term, four years, no guarantees for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| And we can't address in their eight-year term because there's no such thing legally as an eight-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| That's the only heartburn I have with the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Well, then I think can't we word it then that they can only serve for two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| I mean the way it has here is that they can only serve for two years as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4259)|
| 1:11:07| I mean if we don't change that, then that means for as long as they serve, whether it's four years or eight years, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4267)|
| 1:11:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| No, because you only have a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| And once that term's over, everything is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| And once you're reelected, you're all brand new again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| It's like a first term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| It's like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| And the only reason that counts is you can't run for the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| How can you word that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| To get what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| I'm sure you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| I can't because the rule cannot reach beyond the power of the commission, which is a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| So why is this even a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Because you could serve four years out of four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| Not the way we have it written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| The only thing we were trying to bring apart was people weren't we didn't want anybody to interpret it like we're trying to go two out of your term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4318)|
| 1:12:08| meaning two terms because this board only has the power over your term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4328)|
| 1:12:16| And, you know, Brad may say, I don't want to be here next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Well, I can't say he can't be chairman when he's not going to be here because he may not want to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| But this rule only can relate to a term of a commissioner, which is legally four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4346)|
| 1:12:36| I can't say a term of commissioner and I define it as eight because it doesn't legally exist is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| Can we say during their service on the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| I think he goes back to what he said previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| It starts all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| I don't want to serve as a service, whether it's one year or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| I don't disagree totally with what you're saying, but I think it takes the I don't want to do anything that takes the power to choose out of the next commissioner's bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4378)|
| 1:13:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| You know, we're talking, I mean, of course, I can change it all I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| But I just think it takes the power to choose from commissioners because not everybody wants to be a chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| Not everybody wants to not everybody has the desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| No, we're not forcing anybody into it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| No, but you don't want to hamstring it if nobody else wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| Let the commissions decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Knowing this group, I'm sure there's not going to be any dearth of people who want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| This group changes in six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| Well, actually, this group is going to change next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| I mean, but totally change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| It'll be all new in four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| So let them decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| You know, we there are a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| In fact, there are a lot of people on this commission who are opposed to term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| And now they're all in favor of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| So that thinking can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Jill, your answer was to one year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| Just change it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| To put two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| Yeah, it is one year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| But the change would be more than two terms per term as commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4456)|
| 1:14:25| So what we need to do now is send it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Well, you have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| We got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| You have a motion and a second to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| There is a motion and a second to approve all of the readouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| in the rule changes minus the commission term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| And that's been seconded by Commissioner Brown, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| All opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| We got one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Well, that's just for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| No, it didn't include the term thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| It didn't include the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| So you want your vote to be no still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Still want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| I don't expect any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Now the next thing on our agenda is discussion for meeting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| We tried our meeting times for a year to see how it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| And so do I have any suggestions on what we should do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| We haven't clarified the item on page 15 before we go on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| The term wasn't part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| I make a motion that we change it to what Jill said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| We'll need a little bit more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| So at the end of that page, section H, at the end of number 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| it's right now existing languages for more than two terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| and you would add per term as commissioner at the end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| We've got one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Now you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Now we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Discussion regarding meeting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| We've tried the experiment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| and if we want to change it back to the way we were doing it at 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4584)|
| 1:16:31| o'clock, was that our normal meeting time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| We can bring that back before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| The times we've been meeting have allowed certain groups to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| that wouldn't, groups of students from UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| groups of students from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| Some individuals have came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| I was a proponent of this change because I feel that we are here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| We should be here when the public can get here, the majority of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| not all of them, but the majority of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| I also feel, as one of the few people that are on this commission that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| are fully employed during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| that we limit the ability for other people to come and serve on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| body by moving our times during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| It asks a lot of people to take their vacation time to attend these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| People who want to sit on this body, the majority of them are family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| people, and you can't give up your vacations and your time you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| to spend with your family to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| I think it really cuts down the quality of people we can get on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4665)|
| 1:17:53| I hear you end the discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| Do you want to leave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| No recommendation going back to changing time or send a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| to see if they want to change it for full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| Even if I was against, even if I was for changing times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| which I'm independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| I think changing it too many times in a row is confusing to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| I think we just need to let this ride for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| I was against it, but I'm not for changing it just for the sake of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| I was against it, too, and frankly I still am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| but I think we need to give it another six to eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| even another year, and revisit it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| Then it becomes confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| Yeah, otherwise it does become confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| It mainly has a point, it does cut into people who do have to take time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| off from their day jobs, but it also does cut into, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| it cuts into other things, too, that are just as important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| such as family time, not just for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| but for the people that we ask to stay, department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| people like that who are not our direct employees, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| They are not employed by the commission, so they're not our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| but, yeah, we expect them to be here for these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| So, yeah, and also I think that we have missed a lot in the past year by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4751)|
| 1:19:20| not having the chairman's luncheon on our commission days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| That has been a tremendous loss to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| That saved me a ton of money, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| Why can't we have the chairman's luncheon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| Well, how are you going to have a chairman's luncheon when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| it's at 5 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| You can have the chairman's dinner after a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4779)|
| 1:19:47| Okay, so what's the recommendation of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Just leave it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| All right, now you have some other papers before you on electronic voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| that we've got when we were on the TCCA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| You should have it attached to your folder, to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| It should be like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| It's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| It has worked in some other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| What this does is it also, you can use both the new mics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4820)|
| 1:20:27| If you wanted to get new mics, when you touch it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| it tells you which order it comes in on the screen for the chairman here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| Also, when you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| there's no vote cast until everybody casts their vote at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| And when everybody casts the vote and presses the button,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| say they confirm their vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| then all the votes at one time go up on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| and goes up on the television screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| So it lets everybody know when and how they voted or even if you passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| So I thought this was, and it really speeds up the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| is what they were talking about, when you're doing your votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| So would you all entertain having to use these for a month or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| if the people that are pushing this particular one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| would come in and set it up for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| We had this about two years ago, and nothing ever came of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| Well, we didn't actually try it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| We had it explained to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| but I think it would be great to do a test drive on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| So do you want to bring to the commission to ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| to get in touch with these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| They said they would set it up for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| I'll make that motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Any idea what the cost is on this stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| I think the total, if you've got ever whistle and bell on it right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| is about $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| But you'd have, this would almost have to be a joint purchase with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| It has to be done through the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| And PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| And PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| When council meets, every one of these stations is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| That was with 17 working facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| Well, there's more than that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| There's a microphone over there, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| Well, the voting is a mobile device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| It is not something that's hardwired in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| So it could actually just be purchased by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| and then if we wanted the option to have our Board of Zoning Appeals use it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| they could use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| It doesn't necessarily have to be tied in with PBA or city council or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| and it would actually just be run off, say, Jolie's laptop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| There's no additional laptop to be purchased to run this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| And I spoke to the mayor of Williamson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| and they've used it for several years, and they love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| They thought it was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| And some of the smaller counties in Tennessee are using this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| So it's kind of like we need to come up with standards now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| And they could also change the working mechanism that you vote with that is mobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| and you could even put individual's names on it so you know exactly who it goes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| and it's programmed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| If you're going to bring somebody in, it needs to go through purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5013)|
| 1:23:40| and this is not a sole source, and you can't just bring one guy in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| I'll print out on bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| I mean, we can't just take the first horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| You can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| How did they tell us down there that they had it used in other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| you know, where they just demoed it and came back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| and you can have another person demo theirs also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Yeah, if it's $17,000, it has to be a sole source provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| I mean, it's got to be done through Hugh Holt's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| I don't mind doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| But Hugh Holt needs to be doing it, not us, not the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| Well, we just need to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| We make a recommendation to commission that they ask Hugh Holt to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| You have to put out for bids, and, well, this company bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| and somebody, I don't remember the name of the other one we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| What I'm suggesting we do here is use the products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| There's two different kinds of products, not just this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| but some others for us to demo and then to make a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I'll second Amy's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| You'll have to bid it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| You'll be off commission when it comes, Brownie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| You won't have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| It's remote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| I can vote from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| We can try this, right, demo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| If we like it, then ask Hugh Holt to do an RFP for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| Yeah, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| I think we should try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| We brought one in a couple years ago, and it was low grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| No, they demoed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| It was awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| Was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| But it really makes it easier on them if it records correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| because it records all the votes for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| They just have to print and operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| You can work from home, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| So we're just going to make a recommendation that Hugh Holt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| contact these people to see if they'll set up a demo for us for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| a couple or three meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| I don't think you need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| I think you just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| Just ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| I'll take it to Hugh and see what we can get done on it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| Is there any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Do you want to propose these changes next month to commission by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| resolution or this on next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| I would say next month because you don't want to throw something new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| So I'll add a resolution for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| And before we adjourn, I want to thank Jill for her hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| She really worked hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| She took a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| Well, not a lot of questions, but some silly questions from me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| answered them and made me feel halfway decent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| But anyway, I sure do appreciate you, Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Jill rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| If I hear no objections, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5205)|
| 1:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5217)|
| 1:27:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151019?start=5247)|
