| 3:07:47| so there are some natural boundaries there that can distinguish between the characteristics of those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11267)|
| 3:07:54| The requests that have been made by the homeowners to create a buffer, that's not unheard of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11274)|
| 3:08:00| it's certainly not unusual, and in fact it's consistent with the 2033 general plan, 10.11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11280)|
| 3:08:08| states that landscape buffers and wider lots or deeper setbacks shall be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11288)|
| 3:08:14| where the new development abuts lower density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11294)|
| 3:08:17| And we can parcel and parse various small sections of various developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11297)|
| 3:08:22| but what I do know is that overall the Gettysburg, or Gettysburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11302)|
| 3:08:27| the city's view development is at 2.29 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| The row field is less than three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| These are the subdivisions that are closest and most directly impacted by this particular parcel of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11313)|
| 3:08:40| And so we should look at how they're built out and what the general character is of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11320)|
| 3:08:46| And in this case they're built out at three units or less, and this development should be consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11326)|
| 3:08:54| If you have any questions I'd be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11334)|
| 3:08:56| I think we've probably addressed them at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11336)|
| 3:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11344)|
| 3:09:05| This question is for the staff, and the proposal that's before us is recommended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11345)|
| 3:09:12| It's saying three to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| As I've looked at the actions in MPC, I can't find any reference to units in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11355)|
| 3:09:26| I've heard the number 58, a 54, and a 42 in calculations that take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11366)|
| 3:09:35| Question of staff, is there a recommendation in here on number of units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11375)|
| 3:09:41| Not total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11381)|
| 3:09:42| It's strictly the three dwelling units per the entire parcel, the 18 plus acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11382)|
| 3:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11388)|
| 3:09:49| So I'm going to I think I'm going to rely on the recommendation of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11389)|
| 3:09:55| not knowing what that calculation turns out to be, but that's the recommendation that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11395)|
| 3:10:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11402)|
| 3:10:03| In the staff report it did mention that the recommendation of three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11403)|
| 3:10:08| would yield a maximum of 54 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11408)|
| 3:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11413)|
| 3:10:14| So the recommendation that's before us is three to the acre, but the total is 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11414)|
| 3:10:24| I guess, John, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11424)|
| 3:10:26| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11426)|
| 3:10:27| What is the desire of the, because three is 54, 3.6 is 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11427)|
| 3:10:33| What is the units that makes it a development for you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11433)|
| 3:10:38| If we include the house and the four-acre lot, which is included within, if you will, the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11438)|
| 3:10:47| and that will be a part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11447)|
| 3:10:50| We've already got a plan, a development plan for approval submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11450)|
| 3:10:55| Obviously it will, as a consequence of dealing with the people on Coyle Lane, have to be revised somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11455)|
| 3:11:04| but we have calculated it very carefully a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11464)|
| 3:11:08| We have, including that house, we have 58 units in that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11468)|
| 3:11:14| and the four-acre piece with it is a total of 59,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11474)|
| 3:11:19| and that is based upon 3.6 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11479)|
| 3:11:26| So we've got to have 3.6 to get that many units in, and that's what it takes to be able to do the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11486)|
| 3:11:36| Can you use the four acres in his calculation and put it somewhere else, put the density somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11496)|
| 3:11:45| It's Mark Donaldson with MPCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11505)|
| 3:11:46| It's a common practice within planned development districts to calculate a gross number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11506)|
| 3:11:53| that can be developed within the boundary of that district so that you can cluster development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11513)|
| 3:12:00| so one part of it would look more dense than another part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| And, in fact, very often when we deal with small farms, the home place, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11526)|
| 3:12:12| the existing house is set aside, and that density then is clustered somewhere else within the development district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11532)|
| 3:12:20| So to get 60 on 18 acres, I calculated 3.3, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11540)|
| 3:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11548)|
| 3:12:32| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| John, you said you're wanting 3.6 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11556)|
| 3:12:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11561)|
| 3:12:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11562)|
| 3:12:43| Then, Jason, you said just a minute ago you needed 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11563)|
| 3:12:46| Then you said 2.9, so I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| What are you guys asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11571)|
| 3:12:52| I didn't mean to be confusing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11572)|
| 3:12:53| I don't know where the 2.9 came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| 2.4 is what we calculate, but I would like to point out that calculation doesn't even take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11575)|
| 3:13:02| the fact that certain acreage has already been, to our understanding, given to the people to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11582)|
| 3:13:07| so we're really talking about an even smaller portion of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11587)|
| 3:13:11| But 2.4 is the request that we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11591)|
| 3:13:14| You're looking at 2.4 over 18.2 acres or 14.2 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11594)|
| 3:13:19| Over 18.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11599)|
| 3:13:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11600)|
| 3:13:21| I come out with 43 when I calculate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| That's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11603)|
| 3:13:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11604)|
| 3:13:25| If I may further answer, the agreement with the people on the east boundary involves the transfer of some property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11605)|
| 3:13:35| which reduces the total amount for the count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11615)|
| 3:13:39| That's the reason we sit at 3.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11619)|
| 3:13:42| But we didn't give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11622)|
| 3:13:45| They're the ones who wanted and expressed interest in having more of a buffer for their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11625)|
| 3:13:54| and it was at a location where it could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11634)|
| 3:13:59| So in answer to your question, there's a transfer of a small amount of property to, in essence, two people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11639)|
| 3:14:08| and all three of those people on the east side wanted, as did, according to my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11648)|
| 3:14:14| as did everybody else in the area, wanted to keep that large house on that corner lot intact, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11654)|
| 3:14:23| So we've lifted that lot intact, and that's the reason we're now at having to ask for 3.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11663)|
| 3:14:31| And I should clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11671)|
| 3:14:32| Mr. King's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11672)|
| 3:14:33| The property wasn't given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11673)|
| 3:14:34| It was purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11674)|
| 3:14:36| Some of my clients have also offered to purchase property to create a similar buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| but for whatever reason the developer cannot do that on the west side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11681)|
| 3:14:46| so they haven't had that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11686)|
| 3:14:48| We understand the property is sold to be in excess of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11688)|
| 3:14:52| impinging upon the amount of property that can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11692)|
| 3:14:56| But to get back to the original question, 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11696)|
| 3:15:02| Any other discussion from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11702)|
| 3:15:06| We don't have a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11706)|
| 3:15:08| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11708)|
| 3:15:09| I want to get back to the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11709)|
| 3:15:10| You're saying that you're looking, John, you're looking at a total of 59 units, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| You said 58 plus one on the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11716)|
| 3:15:17| Down to the 3.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11717)|
| 3:15:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11718)|
| 3:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| I guess my question would be the one to four, the zoning, looking at the KGIS map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11723)|
| 3:15:30| the one to four covers, was that developed as one piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11730)|
| 3:15:35| or does the zoning sit on one piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| Because the way you look at it on KGIS, the Polo Club and the Getty's View side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11737)|
| 3:15:41| are both the same lot, same parcel on the zoning side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11741)|
| 3:15:45| Now, was it developed as the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11745)|
| 3:15:48| It was developed in sections, but that's one zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11748)|
| 3:15:52| It's PR and one to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11752)|
| 3:15:55| Was it one person that got all that one district taken care of, or do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11755)|
| 3:15:59| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11759)|
| 3:16:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11766)|
| 3:16:07| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11767)|
| 3:16:08| Mark, for what these people are asking for, if we want to vote in their favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11768)|
| 3:16:13| we vote for how this reads right now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11773)|
| 3:16:19| No, I would say that the opposition has described a scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11779)|
| 3:16:26| whereby you're reducing the density to a number to reflect the large lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11786)|
| 3:16:36| that will be created for the existing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11796)|
| 3:16:41| And do a calculation to allow a total of three units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11801)|
| 3:16:46| but by using the larger acreage, you need to approve 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11806)|
| 3:16:52| So they've backed out the acreage from the lot that will be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11812)|
| 3:16:57| for the existing house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11819)|
| 3:17:00| But it's still within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11820)|
| 3:17:03| It's within the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11823)|
| 3:17:04| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11824)|
| 3:17:06| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11826)|
| 3:17:09| This guy's loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11829)|
| 3:17:11| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| I just want to get clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11833)|
| 3:17:17| The 3.6, that would come up to 64, but that doesn't take out for roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11837)|
| 3:17:24| the acreage for all the roads and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11844)|
| 3:17:26| That's just the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| So it's actually less acreage once you do the roads and the sewage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11848)|
| 3:17:34| and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11854)|
| 3:17:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11855)|
| 3:17:36| I'm trying to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11856)|
| 3:17:39| Because a lot of numbers are getting thrown around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| and it's kind of starting to get lost in translation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11861)|
| 3:17:48| Generally, within a planned development district, we deal with a gross density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11868)|
| 3:17:53| So we just simply describe the amount of land within that boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11873)|
| 3:17:58| and multiply it by the density that's been assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11878)|
| 3:18:01| I just want to make sure I'm adding it up right up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11883)|
| 3:18:06| I guess they approved the 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11886)|
| 3:18:08| That's what staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11888)|
| 3:18:09| What was the vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11889)|
| 3:18:12| Did we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11892)|
| 3:18:13| The vote was 8-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11893)|
| 3:18:15| 8-6 on the 3.0?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| If I may, in response to your question, Mr. Olinby, it was a split vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11899)|
| 3:18:25| and I had intended to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11905)|
| 3:18:28| Most of the discussion was over a number of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11908)|
| 3:18:38| but it pretty much got down to the fact that the recommendation of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11918)|
| 3:18:44| was add three units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11924)|
| 3:18:49| and I'd say some of those split out because of the density that was being put with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11929)|
| 3:18:56| the vote in the form of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11936)|
| 3:18:58| So I think a number of them had in mind an increase in that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11938)|
| 3:19:04| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11944)|
| 3:19:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11945)|
| 3:19:06| So then looking at the property that's to the west, what is the actual density there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11946)|
| 3:19:18| On Gettysview Way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| The built-out density, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| It's what, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11962)|
| 3:19:23| The density on the map, it's one to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11963)|
| 3:19:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11966)|
| 3:19:27| The built-out density, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11967)|
| 3:19:30| At MPC, it was represented as 2.29 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11970)|
| 3:19:34| Does that include the polo club?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| That does not include the polo club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| That would just be the Gettysview subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11978)|
| 3:19:44| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11984)|
| 3:19:45| Looking over here at the polo club, because there's other homes that back up to the polo club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11985)|
| 3:19:52| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11992)|
| 3:19:55| What is the setback of those small lots to the polo club?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11995)|
| 3:20:01| I assume that those are joined dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12001)|
| 3:20:04| What is the setback on them from the property line to those folks' houses that back up to the polo club?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12004)|
| 3:20:11| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| Is that a 35-foot setback, too, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12013)|
| 3:20:15| It doesn't look like it's that far, but I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12015)|
| 3:20:18| They're right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12018)|
| 3:20:21| They're lined up right next to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| No, but what is the setback between the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12023)|
| 3:20:25| You can't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12025)|
| 3:20:26| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12026)|
| 3:20:27| You can't speak out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12027)|
| 3:20:28| You have to come down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12028)|
| 3:20:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12029)|
| 3:20:32| We won't be able to track you if you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12034)|
| 3:20:35| Name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12035)|
| 3:20:36| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12036)|
| 3:20:37| My name is Mark Shannon, 9206 Center Court Way, Gettysview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| My house is one of the houses that backs up to that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12041)|
| 3:20:44| They're attached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12044)|
| 3:20:45| They're very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12045)|
| 3:20:46| They're three to four stories above the houses because they're built on a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12046)|
| 3:20:50| And the setback on the wall to their property and my property line is about eight, nine feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12050)|
| 3:21:00| See, that's between properties within the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12060)|
| 3:21:09| In our instance, since it is a peripheral boundary, we have a 35-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12069)|
| 3:21:15| as did the people who built along Gettysview Way on, if you will, the east side of that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12075)|
| 3:21:25| They also had a 35-foot rear yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| But it was a peripheral setback that's 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| And within the subdivision development over there itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12092)|
| 3:21:36| then the distance or the setbacks are totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12096)|
| 3:21:42| While you're up there, John, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| So there's a 35-foot setback in Gettysview there between the property line and the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12104)|
| 3:21:54| and then there would be another 35-foot setback, so we're talking about a 70-foot setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12114)|
| 3:21:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12119)|
| 3:22:01| Now, just to refresh my memory, what did you agree on on this buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12121)|
| 3:22:09| I mean, has there been anything agreed to on the buffer of leaving anything there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12129)|
| 3:22:13| or is it going to be clear-cut up to their property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12133)|
| 3:22:17| What we have told them is reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12137)|
| 3:22:23| And the reality is if you look at the size of the lot and the dimensions of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12143)|
| 3:22:28| that are likely to be built there and the price range that everybody wants to be built there, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12148)|
| 3:22:33| there won't be the opportunity to leave the kind of buffer they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12153)|
| 3:22:39| And so what we have done is tell them the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12159)|
| 3:22:45| We promise to try to preserve every tree possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12165)|
| 3:22:50| and that promise is backed with some incentive from our standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12170)|
| 3:22:55| It's to our advantage to keep as much of that as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12175)|
| 3:23:00| Number one, it costs money to remove them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12180)|
| 3:23:03| but number two, the interest of potential buyers of property from us mirrors, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12183)|
| 3:23:10| some of the interest of those on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12190)|
| 3:23:14| We'd like to leave as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12194)|
| 3:23:18| I don't like to have people commit to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12198)|
| 3:23:22| when there's a good opportunity that you can't deliver or at least during a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12202)|
| 3:23:29| What we told them at our meeting, and I think we were accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| was that once this property starts being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12212)|
| 3:23:36| you're going to be looking at property there that is not going to be landscaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12216)|
| 3:23:41| There are not going to be very many trees left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12221)|
| 3:23:44| It's just a fact of life to get the equipment in there to do it, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12224)|
| 3:23:49| But that property will mature over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12229)|
| 3:23:52| and there will be the interest of people there to create a buffer across the rear of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12232)|
| 3:24:02| It will mature out, but I don't want to tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12242)|
| 3:24:05| oh, we're going to leave a 15-foot wide undisturbed strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12245)|
| 3:24:08| when it's not likely that we'll be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| But we do have an interest in trying to conserve as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12251)|
| 3:24:16| Just to get back to what I was asking about initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12256)|
| 3:24:20| so on the west side of this Getty's View property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12260)|
| 3:24:27| there really turns out to be about a total setback of 44 feet going up to the polo club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12267)|
| 3:24:35| and it would be 75 feet, no, 70 feet, 35 and 35, 70 feet on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12275)|
| 3:24:46| There will be 70 feet on our side, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12286)|
| 3:24:50| I mean, between our houses and their houses, there will be a 70-foot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12290)|
| 3:24:57| And just one other question while I still have the floor in this I'm addressing to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12297)|
| 3:25:03| What is the MPC's analysis of the traffic concern involving both the density that the homeowners is proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12303)|
| 3:25:14| and the density the developer is proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12314)|
| 3:25:17| Is that looked at as being an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12317)|
| 3:25:20| Because I do know the Westland area very well, and that's really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12320)|
| 3:25:24| if you talk about what my biggest concern is, it deals with the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12324)|
| 3:25:29| because this is one point they're absolutely accurate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12329)|
| 3:25:32| is that the traffic in the morning and the traffic when school gets let out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12332)|
| 3:25:37| I mean, it backs up from, I mean, it's an issue from Ebenezer to the Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12337)|
| 3:25:43| And what was the MPC's analysis or comments on the traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12343)|
| 3:25:48| Well, we did an estimate of the traffic impact based on the request of up to five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12348)|
| 3:25:55| and the general rule of thumb is about 10 trip ends per day per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12355)|
| 3:26:01| So we're in the range of 950 estimated traffic volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12361)|
| 3:26:07| At three units to the acre, then it would be a 40% reduction from that down to the 500 to 600 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12367)|
| 3:26:17| And to compare us, we don't have the actual traffic counts of Westland in the report that I'm seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12377)|
| 3:26:36| So at the point of the design plan, which is the middle step of the subdivision process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12396)|
| 3:26:44| there will be a traffic analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12404)|
| 3:26:47| Well, this may not even reach the threshold for a traffic analysis, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12407)|
| 3:26:51| So that's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12411)|
| 3:26:52| Yeah, that's triggered at 75 units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12412)|
| 3:26:56| Let me back up and give you some information to correct what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12416)|
| 3:27:02| We do in the staff report, we indicate at three, it would be approximately 588 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12422)|
| 3:27:10| The requested five would be 951 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12430)|
| 3:27:16| And then back, just to clarify, on the density to the west, we refer to that subdivision to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12436)|
| 3:27:25| That is at 2.29, but it doesn't include that whole one to four dwelling unit per area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12445)|
| 3:27:30| In other words, it doesn't include the attached area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12450)|
| 3:27:34| So I can't tell you what the overall density for that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12454)|
| 3:27:37| but it is true for the subdivision immediately to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12457)|
| 3:27:40| It is 2.29 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12460)|
| 3:27:44| So the traffic is not an issue at 2.5 or 3.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12464)|
| 3:27:51| Traffic is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12471)|
| 3:27:54| Is that your interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12474)|
| 3:27:57| Because it doesn't even merit or it doesn't even trigger a traffic study until you hit 700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12477)|
| 3:28:03| 75 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12483)|
| 3:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12486)|
| 3:28:12| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12492)|
| 3:28:13| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12493)|
| 3:28:14| Scott Smith, 1476 Linesman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| One other thing to keep in mind as it relates to traffic, from the aerials I found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12496)|
| 3:28:21| Westland Drive was just widened and that was completed around 2004, 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12501)|
| 3:28:26| was taken and was upgraded to three lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12506)|
| 3:28:29| It's two lanes and then a turn lane in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12509)|
| 3:28:32| So it's fairly recent upgrading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12512)|
| 3:28:35| So as it relates to traffic, I wanted you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12515)|
| 3:28:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12521)|
| 3:28:42| Did you have something, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| I was just going to point out that while we have been told that it doesn't rise to the level of the volume of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12524)|
| 3:28:49| to merit a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| we would still suggest that given the high volume that is concentrated in that very location with the school less than a quarter mile away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12531)|
| 3:29:00| that it does present a traffic concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12540)|
| 3:29:02| whether or not the standards that are applied, the black and white numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12542)|
| 3:29:07| justify or merit a traffic study itself in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12547)|
| 3:29:11| There still will be significant traffic issues with that volume of over 500 vehicles a day coming out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12551)|
| 3:29:17| especially during the mornings when that line of traffic is already backed up to that point from AL lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12557)|
| 3:29:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| Jason, you all keep talking about that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12565)|
| 3:29:27| I'm going to put an insurance office down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12567)|
| 3:29:29| Keep that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12569)|
| 3:29:31| John, I'm ready to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12571)|
| 3:29:34| Commissioner Smith, go back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12574)|
| 3:29:38| I was talking with the law director here, the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12578)|
| 3:29:41| Was there anything with the buffering that you agreed to on any type of buffering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12581)|
| 3:29:48| I cannot say we agreed on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| We made, in essence, a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| I don't understand a promise to be like a contract that they have to accept or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12592)|
| 3:29:59| We wanted them to understand we were going to try to work with them as best we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12599)|
| 3:30:03| Beyond making a promise to do the best we could, that's essentially it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12603)|
| 3:30:08| Let me say we're here on a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12608)|
| 3:30:12| We've got a development plan ready to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12612)|
| 3:30:17| While a traffic study is not required, MPC, if they want one, can ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12617)|
| 3:30:26| They may or may not in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12626)|
| 3:30:28| But I don't think at this point in the procedure, since we're here on a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12628)|
| 3:30:35| I don't know that that is that significant or that pertinent to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12635)|
| 3:30:41| But we've got the numbers of trip generations that will be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12641)|
| 3:30:45| I think they can look at it and make a determination as to whether they think they want one or don't want one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12645)|
| 3:30:52| But I would simply observe again that there's not a whole lot of property left yet to develop out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12652)|
| 3:31:03| There obviously is some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12663)|
| 3:31:05| But I think that the traffic generated by this particular subdivision is de minimis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12665)|
| 3:31:15| by comparison to what's going on all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12675)|
| 3:31:21| Okay. Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| You got my attention a little bit when you were talking about the slopes and cutting the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12683)|
| 3:31:27| I'm going to pass this on to the homeowners that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12687)|
| 3:31:30| A little known fact, if you're building a house today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12690)|
| 3:31:32| if we're out here and we're putting three or four houses out here in this lot that's out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12692)|
| 3:31:36| no house can be under any type of tree at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| All the limbs have to be cut for insurance purposes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12699)|
| 3:31:44| But I'll make a motion and see what commission wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12704)|
| 3:31:48| I'll make a motion to approve at a density of 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12708)|
| 3:31:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12718)|
| 3:32:02| Motion fails for lack of second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12722)|
| 3:32:10| Is there another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12730)|
| 3:32:12| I'm going to make one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12732)|
| 3:32:14| I know for everyone out there listening to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12734)|
| 3:32:17| and it's probably agonizing for the attorneys and the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12737)|
| 3:32:22| as well as it is for the people that live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12742)|
| 3:32:27| One of the problems that we have is that this property belongs to somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12747)|
| 3:32:33| and they need to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| And I'm not talking about the developer, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12755)|
| 3:32:37| I'm not as interested in his economic situation or how he's going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12757)|
| 3:32:43| but it belongs to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12763)|
| 3:32:45| And we take very seriously in government when we either have to seize somebody's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12765)|
| 3:32:51| we call it imminent domain for a certain reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12771)|
| 3:32:54| or when we're going to deny an individual the right to sell his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12774)|
| 3:33:00| because he's selling the property because, one, he wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12780)|
| 3:33:03| and the other, he may very well need the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| This may be a little bit different situation than we sometimes see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12785)|
| 3:33:08| with some farmer who has no assets but his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12788)|
| 3:33:12| But for the government to tell a man he cannot sell his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12792)|
| 3:33:16| or put such restrictions on it that he can't sell it is pretty serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12796)|
| 3:33:20| and that's why we're taking this very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12800)|
| 3:33:25| And if we're going to deny a man the right to sell his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12805)|
| 3:33:30| we have to have a pretty darn good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12810)|
| 3:33:33| We have to show that it's going to directly harm someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12813)|
| 3:33:37| We don't want him to put something where it's running mud down on someone else's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12817)|
| 3:33:42| because they're causing harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12822)|
| 3:33:44| But it has to be for a pretty darn serious reason that we're going to deny this man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12824)|
| 3:33:53| that owns the property the right to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| And I just want to put that out there just so everyone understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12835)|
| 3:34:01| why we're deliberating on this so long and we're all hesitant to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12841)|
| 3:34:05| because it's a pretty serious matter that we're having to deliberate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12845)|
| 3:34:09| And I know the homeowners are affected by it, and I've made the statement before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12849)|
| 3:34:13| and you haven't been down here for all of these, that I'll usually support the homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12853)|
| 3:34:17| but it has to be a pretty good reason why we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12857)|
| 3:34:21| And that's just why we're struggling with this and trying to find out what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12861)|
| 3:34:27| We have to, to a certain degree, take the developer's word that he can't buy the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12867)|
| 3:34:33| or the man can't sell the property unless they do it at a certain level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12873)|
| 3:34:36| and we're really deciding is it causing that much harm to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12876)|
| 3:34:40| to where we're going to prevent a man from selling his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12880)|
| 3:34:42| And I'll just stop there and let that sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12882)|
| 3:34:46| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12886)|
| 3:34:47| Jason, that's what you were needing, 2.4, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12887)|
| 3:34:50| 2.4 was what we passed, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12890)|
| 3:34:56| Yes, ma'am, if you want to come down and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12896)|
| 3:34:58| Yeah, come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12898)|
| 3:34:59| Yeah, just come to the mic and name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12899)|
| 3:35:07| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12907)|
| 3:35:08| My name is Gamble Ugama, and what I would like to say is that I appreciate your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12908)|
| 3:35:14| To us, he's not just a homeowner selling his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12914)|
| 3:35:17| He's our neighbor for two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| We don't want to oppose the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| We certainly don't want to harm the person selling their home and property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12921)|
| 3:35:25| We just want the same consistent look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| That's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12927)|
| 3:35:30| Yeah, and I guess my kind of my statement is, ma'am, you can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12930)|
| 3:35:34| It's kind of a general statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12934)|
| 3:35:35| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12935)|
| 3:35:36| The kind of a general statement is the agonizing part of this that I think Dr. Briggs is speaking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12936)|
| 3:35:44| is, in Getty's view, the people that are here opposing the 3.6 have a one-to-four zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12944)|
| 3:35:53| And so, I mean, although it's built out differently, the zoning is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12953)|
| 3:35:57| And so it's a very similar piece of property that seems like it should be treated the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12957)|
| 3:36:04| and actually 3.6 is less zoning than what they have at Getty's view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12964)|
| 3:36:08| And so that's kind of what's got me a little bit conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12968)|
| 3:36:12| Commissioner Willoughby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12972)|
| 3:36:16| I'm going to make a motion that we approve this at 3.6 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12976)|
| 3:36:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12984)|
| 3:36:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12985)|
| 3:36:26| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12986)|
| 3:36:28| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12988)|
| 3:36:33| All right, let's do a roll call vote, starting with the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12993)|
| 3:36:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=12997)|

| 3:37:16| to assist with the approval of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13036)|
| 3:37:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13037)|

| 3:37:38| A agricultural to PR plan residential, property located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13058)|
| 3:37:41| west side Ebenezer Road, property located north of High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13061)|
| 3:37:46| Bridge Drive in the Fifth Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13066)|
| 3:37:49| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| It's the same applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13072)|
| 3:37:54| Man, busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13074)|
| 3:37:55| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| Ok.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13077)|
| 3:37:58| Do you want to speak, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13078)|
| 3:38:00| We all want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13080)|
| 3:38:02| And you want the opposition to speak first, or do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13082)|
| 3:38:10| That's fine. I'll yield to them. I think I understand their issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13090)|
| 3:38:16| Thank you. I'll just, sir, I'll just need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13096)|
| 3:38:23| Absolutely. My name is Michael Ulm. I live at 8828 Shoreham Boulevard in Bennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13103)|
| 3:38:29| We're in a slightly different situation here. We actually do not oppose this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13109)|
| 3:38:34| but we do oppose the access point. All of us here as residents are directly around Halifax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13114)|
| 3:38:42| I live on Halifax myself, not at the primary entry point to this subdivision that is in proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13122)|
| 3:38:50| But we're very, very concerned because this is a well-established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13130)|
| 3:38:54| This neighborhood has been in existence for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13134)|
| 3:38:57| Many of us that purchased our homes within that neighborhood purchased it specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13137)|
| 3:39:01| because of the stability, the lack of growth. We talked to the, I talked to KPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13141)|
| 3:39:08| They said that we should have had foreseeability in terms of an access road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13148)|
| 3:39:12| that did not ever appear to me as an access road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13152)|
| 3:39:15| And obviously the primary property owner that is now selling, and we're for their sale and for their profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13155)|
| 3:39:21| We're capitalists here and want them to do very, very well by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13161)|
| 3:39:25| But the impact with two small children, six and four years old, one of my children is special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13165)|
| 3:39:31| We chose this neighborhood because of our concern of this rate of traffic we saw in other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13171)|
| 3:39:39| We specifically scouted this neighborhood. We saw very, very low rates of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13179)|
| 3:39:43| something that we thought was very safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13183)|
| 3:39:46| There's high pedestrian, high bicycle riding in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13186)|
| 3:39:49| Again, the stability of it. So we think, and I'll allow my other neighbors to talk here in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13189)|
| 3:39:56| that this is a safety issue. We're for the property development in and of itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13196)|
| 3:40:00| but it should have its own individual access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13200)|
| 3:40:04| Why a subdivision is being used for another subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13204)|
| 3:40:08| I'm unaware of that ever occurring in Knoxville and or other communities that I've lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13208)|
| 3:40:15| And KPC cited Sequoia Hills as an example of a subdivision having another subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13215)|
| 3:40:23| One, economically, these are two completely different neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13223)|
| 3:40:29| Two, Sequoia Hills has within it safety precautions for the traffic involved in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13229)|
| 3:40:34| at a density level that far is less than Bennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13234)|
| 3:40:38| There's speed bumps there as well as traffic lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13238)|
| 3:40:41| None of these things are part of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| None of these are taking into consideration the safety of our children within that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13243)|
| 3:40:47| which is very exasperating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| So forgive my emotion here, but I made a major investment for the safety of my kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13249)|
| 3:40:54| and now that seems to be being thrown out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13254)|
| 3:40:58| We want the sale. Let them have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13258)|
| 3:41:00| But please give an access road specifically to that neighborhood because they're not consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13260)|
| 3:41:07| Is this 1351 Ebenezer? Is that the address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13267)|
| 3:41:11| I mean, I know it's kind of the wooded area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13271)|
| 3:41:15| What's at the dead end of Halifax? What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13275)|
| 3:41:22| Halifax makes a great big loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| Yeah, but what's the dead end of Halifax? It looks like a house at the dead end or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13284)|
| 3:41:27| There is a house there in a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13287)|
| 3:41:33| My name is Carol Hawkins, and I live at 8800 Shoreham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13293)|
| 3:41:36| but my parcel address is 1300 Halifax, and I tried to email you all pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13296)|
| 3:41:41| I hope they've been helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13301)|
| 3:41:44| So my house sits at the corner, Shoreham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13304)|
| 3:41:48| which is direct access onto Ebenezer right there at the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13308)|
| 3:41:52| and then the other side, my mailbox, is on Halifax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13312)|
| 3:41:55| There's four houses, and it's a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13315)|
| 3:41:58| It is literally a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13318)|
| 3:42:00| One of the comments in Metropolitan Planning Commission was that Mr. Testerman did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13320)|
| 3:42:05| or had intentions that that area would be developed because there was no cul-de-sac as an ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13325)|
| 3:42:10| He didn't have the option. The property ended right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13330)|
| 3:42:14| So that's just some misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13334)|
| 3:42:17| And I would like to echo Michael's statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13337)|
| 3:42:20| It's a well-walked area. It's also a well-exited area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13340)|
| 3:42:25| The traffic there is intense, especially in the morning with school buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13345)|
| 3:42:30| and people leaving for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13350)|
| 3:42:32| And if you'll note, we directly oppose Brentmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13352)|
| 3:42:36| So it's not only our subdivision exiting onto Ebenezer, it's theirs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13356)|
| 3:42:43| And it's the only place on Ebenezer that I'm aware of that there's two neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13363)|
| 3:42:47| dumping out at the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13367)|
| 3:42:49| We really do think this is a huge safety issue, that you would have access that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13369)|
| 3:42:54| from a neighborhood that is not attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13374)|
| 3:42:57| And I believe you all have estimated up to 350 car trips a day passed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13377)|
| 3:43:03| It's unreasonable. So I appreciate your consideration in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13383)|
| 3:43:13| Good evening. My name is Sharon Dobbins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13393)|
| 3:43:15| I live at 1246 Halifax Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13395)|
| 3:43:18| And I built my home in Bennington 29 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13398)|
| 3:43:21| And I have watched the traffic in Bennington and the difficulty of coming out onto Ebenezer double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13401)|
| 3:43:28| because the commission agreed to widen Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| When I built my home there, it was two lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13411)|
| 3:43:34| With the onset of that, and it really has facilitated a lot of traffic going through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13414)|
| 3:43:39| it has made it extremely difficult for the residents of Bennington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13419)|
| 3:43:43| especially during work time and school buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13423)|
| 3:43:47| for us to be able to exit off out of our subdivision onto Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13427)|
| 3:43:53| It is one lane in. It's one lane out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13433)|
| 3:43:56| We have no ability to stack cars in order to accommodate the additional trips coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13436)|
| 3:44:02| If you all agree to do that, it will take our subdivision to make it extremely difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13442)|
| 3:44:07| and unsafe to get in and out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13447)|
| 3:44:10| So we respectfully appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13450)|
| 3:44:15| Let me wait and see what John King has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13455)|
| 3:44:18| I have just a general question, but we'll let him make his comments first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13458)|
| 3:44:23| I don't know if Scott Smith can afford to have him talk anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13463)|
| 3:44:27| Go ahead, Dr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13467)|
| 3:44:34| John King, 620 Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13474)|
| 3:44:44| MPC approved this at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13484)|
| 3:44:49| Ebenezer at this point is a four-lane street with a center turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13489)|
| 3:44:59| I guess it's an arterial. I don't remember bus for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13499)|
| 3:45:08| Minor arterial, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13508)|
| 3:45:12| Again, and I can say for sure on this one, it was a split vote at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13512)|
| 3:45:18| and over this one the opposition basically was the same points made here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13518)|
| 3:45:25| The opposition was to the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13525)|
| 3:45:28| The motion at MPC was to approve in accordance with staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13528)|
| 3:45:34| and staff had recommended no direct access to Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13534)|
| 3:45:41| I think that vote was like seven to six to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13541)|
| 3:45:46| and the six were obviously of a mind that they ought to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13546)|
| 3:45:52| and have direct access to Ebenezer, but the motion was what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13552)|
| 3:45:56| and that's the way the vote came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13556)|
| 3:45:58| So we've got it approved at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13558)|
| 3:46:02| We've got 29 houses proposed for this piece of ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13562)|
| 3:46:07| and once again, that's what it takes to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13567)|
| 3:46:13| If you impose that condition and make us in essence go out of this subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13573)|
| 3:46:21| turn to the left and go through the adjoining subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13581)|
| 3:46:25| turn to the right to get back to Ebenezer Road, we lose two lots at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13585)|
| 3:46:32| I know that Mr. Mosley has told me he's done it and looked at it and looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13592)|
| 3:46:35| and he thinks we're going to lose three if they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13595)|
| 3:46:38| We are in agreement with the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13598)|
| 3:46:41| and the reasons for that opposition about putting our traffic into their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13601)|
| 3:46:48| If you look at their map, again, it's in your packet of material, if you look at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13608)|
| 3:46:54| one of the points raised in support of putting that condition on there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13614)|
| 3:47:00| well, the entrance to this would therefore be close to the access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13620)|
| 3:47:06| down at the subdivision immediately to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13626)|
| 3:47:11| We would be closer to that intersection at Highbridge Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13631)|
| 3:47:15| So moving it further away, you move it over into the adjoining subdivision, Bennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13635)|
| 3:47:24| Look at the size of the development there that comes out of and into one access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13644)|
| 3:47:32| Look at the subdivision immediately to the south of us, Highbridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13652)|
| 3:47:37| that subdivision actually has two points of access to Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13657)|
| 3:47:44| If you look at the layout, it is easy to see that about half of that subdivision development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13664)|
| 3:47:51| will enter and exit to the northernmost entrance, Highbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13671)|
| 3:47:56| The other half will be using for access the southern point of intersection with Highbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13676)|
| 3:48:04| So a lot less traffic to contend with coming out of the Highbridge and into Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13684)|
| 3:48:13| I don't think that's a critical point to make about why we're taking it through the adjoining subdivision, Bennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13693)|
| 3:48:23| If you look at Bennington, yes, where we would tie into that stubbed road on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13703)|
| 3:48:30| there are only four houses between there and the intersection of Shoreham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13710)|
| 3:48:35| But once again, you're going to take all the houses on, in essence, both sides of Rye Gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13715)|
| 3:48:43| that are going to be going that way and look at all of the houses that will be using that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13723)|
| 3:48:52| which is from Ebenezer, one lot in depth from Ebenezer to that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13732)|
| 3:49:01| I've been out there in a car with my client, and you can stack in that little distance on Shoreham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13741)|
| 3:49:12| I think you can stack three, perhaps four cars into that lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13752)|
| 3:49:17| It is only one lane going out and one lane coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13757)|
| 3:49:21| There isn't an opportunity for cars to be side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13761)|
| 3:49:25| So no matter which way you're going to go on Ebenezer, when you come out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13765)|
| 3:49:30| everybody's going to be in one lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13770)|
| 3:49:33| I can see how they're concerned about, in the morning and in the afternoons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13773)|
| 3:49:38| a stackup of traffic that involves that first intersection into their subdivision, i.e., Shoreham and Halifax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13778)|
| 3:49:48| and the problems that that's going to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13788)|
| 3:49:51| The major point from our standpoint is, and I think these people can also tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13791)|
| 3:49:57| there's a bit of a sight distance issue to the north from the Shoreham intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13797)|
| 3:50:06| I don't say it doesn't meet sight distance requirements, but traffic there flows a little faster than the stated speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13806)|
| 3:50:16| and there is a bit of a sight distance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13816)|
| 3:50:20| If you go to where we propose to have access out of the middle, if you will, of our subdivision development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13820)|
| 3:50:31| we increase sight distance for us in that direction a good 250 to 300 feet more sight distance by going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13831)|
| 3:50:41| Sight distance in the other direction is not a concern or a consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13841)|
| 3:50:47| I think, in short, what we come up with in an analysis of the area is that it is better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13847)|
| 3:50:59| and I believe will operate better if the access for this subdivision is directly onto Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13859)|
| 3:51:12| I say that there's no opposition to what we have requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13872)|
| 3:51:18| There's no opposition to the five units per acre, which we got at MPC, and the only concern is that access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13878)|
| 3:51:27| We would ask that you eliminate that condition and approve rezoning at five dwelling units per acre without that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13887)|
| 3:51:38| I ask for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13898)|
| 3:51:42| In this one, we ended up on a proposed development plan with 29 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13902)|
| 3:51:52| Again, it's a single family detached development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13912)|
| 3:51:55| This is where the applicant and the opposition are both against you, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13915)|
| 3:52:01| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13921)|
| 3:52:02| You just stole my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13922)|
| 3:52:06| It's very rare we see this happen, and it's encouraging that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13926)|
| 3:52:14| We are totally authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13934)|
| 3:52:17| I'm asking this to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13937)|
| 3:52:19| Normally we just approve the density or we'll approve this, but we can go ahead and remove that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13939)|
| 3:52:25| That's legal to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13945)|
| 3:52:29| Just so we can go on with the discussion and somebody can make a substitute motion later if they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13949)|
| 3:52:34| but I recommend or I make a motion that we approve the changing of the zoning from agriculture to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13954)|
| 3:52:42| at a density of five dwelling units per acre and remove the condition on the property so it can be exited on to Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13962)|
| 3:52:55| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13975)|
| 3:52:58| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13978)|
| 3:53:02| I'd like to hear Ms. Dobbins again just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13982)|
| 3:53:04| That is your main contention, isn't it, exiting on to Ebenezer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13984)|
| 3:53:11| She wants that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13991)|
| 3:53:14| No, I do not want the proposed subdivision to enter into Bennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=13994)|
| 3:53:20| Okay, you're fine with Ebenezer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14000)|
| 3:53:22| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14002)|
| 3:53:24| You and I talked many months ago about this, and I wanted to make sure we were clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14004)|
| 3:53:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14008)|
| 3:53:30| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14010)|
| 3:53:32| I would like to hear from MPC because I was not going to support going into Ebenezer at Bennington at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14012)|
| 3:53:41| but I would like to, so I was prepared not to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14021)|
| 3:53:46| I would like to hear the downside of putting yet another subdivision on to Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14026)|
| 3:53:52| I know that's already a pretty busy street as far as spurs going into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14032)|
| 3:53:57| so could you describe that, what you think it's going to do to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14037)|
| 3:54:01| Thank you, Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14041)|
| 3:54:05| One of the principles of managing traffic on arterials is to minimize friction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14045)|
| 3:54:12| We talk about minimizing friction, and that friction is brought about by streets entering on to that arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14052)|
| 3:54:21| So in order to get an arterial road to work the way it's designed, you need to minimize that friction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14061)|
| 3:54:28| and one way to minimize that friction is to utilize access points that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14068)|
| 3:54:35| We have a provision in our subdivision regulations that's been in place for decades and decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14075)|
| 3:54:42| that when developing a property, the developer is to stub out a street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14082)|
| 3:54:47| adjacent undeveloped property for future connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14087)|
| 3:54:52| I think generally there's a belief amongst transportation planners and land use planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14092)|
| 3:55:01| that connectivity between subdivisions results in a street system as a whole that functions more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14101)|
| 3:55:10| It provides options to any particular landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14110)|
| 3:55:16| So by connecting to Bennington, we give people in the new area three options to intersect with arterial roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14116)|
| 3:55:25| compared to the one option that would be the cul-de-sac version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14125)|
| 3:55:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14134)|
| 3:55:39| If you all vote to do what MPC has proposed, the friction, you are exchanging it for one type of friction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14139)|
| 3:55:48| for another type of friction that is really far more damaging to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14148)|
| 3:55:54| You're still going to have to deal with the same number of cars coming out on to Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14154)|
| 3:55:59| That's not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14159)|
| 3:56:01| If you don't give them their own entrance and try to funnel everything through us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14161)|
| 3:56:06| when we already have trouble getting out, to me that's just making it a different, worse friction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14166)|
| 3:56:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| I think we're going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14179)|
| 3:56:21| The motion on the floor right now is to have that egress directly on to Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14181)|
| 3:56:28| So I think we're going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14188)|
| 3:56:29| We'll see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14189)|
| 3:56:30| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14190)|
| 3:56:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14192)|
| 3:56:35| To the point of the gentleman that started the discussion, he mentioned, well, I mean, safety is a primary consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14195)|
| 3:56:44| Speed bumps, I mean, how would, did anybody offer speed bumps to satisfy the homeowners there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14204)|
| 3:56:53| in terms of a safety adjustment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14213)|
| 3:56:59| When I made my original call to KPC, no such discussion or no such point was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14219)|
| 3:57:05| And, again, they cited Sequoia Hills as the example of a subdivision being used to access another subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14225)|
| 3:57:14| and none of those safety concerns seem to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14234)|
| 3:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14238)|
| 3:57:19| Well, Buzz or Mark, is that a, I mean, for you all or for those, if some of the folks up here would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14239)|
| 3:57:27| are prone towards going with a staff recommendation, how would speed or, you know, devices like that be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14247)|
| 3:57:37| Traffic calming is generally used to slow traffic down rather than to manage the volume of that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14257)|
| 3:57:48| We haven't gotten to that point of in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14268)|
| 3:57:53| We're at the zoning stage right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14273)|
| 3:57:58| The actual design of the street will be approved by Knox County Engineering at the second stage of the subdivision process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14278)|
| 3:58:06| Also, the current subdivision has to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14286)|
| 3:58:09| The county policy shows that the current residents have to approve that measure for speed humps and traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14289)|
| 3:58:17| and they're not going to come in and put a bunch of speed humps in there without a vote of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14297)|
| 3:58:25| Yeah, I think the problem is here isn't people going too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14305)|
| 3:58:29| It's a bottleneck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14309)|
| 3:58:30| You know, it's a bottleneck really where Halifax goes into Shoreham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14310)|
| 3:58:36| There's not a lot of room there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14316)|
| 3:58:38| You can imagine just a little bit of traffic backing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14318)|
| 3:58:41| It's only one house length where Halifax comes in, and then the people can't make a right-hand turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14321)|
| 3:58:48| And then after they come off of Ebenezer onto Shoreham, you've only got a one lot length there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14328)|
| 3:58:53| and then they're trying to make a turn onto Halifax to the left, but the traffic's backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14333)|
| 3:58:58| It seems to me it's just a bottleneck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14338)|
| 3:59:00| And if I may add to that, again, our primary concern is the amount of traffic, the safety issue that concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14340)|
| 3:59:07| And that additional flow really is going to change the dynamics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14347)|
| 3:59:10| This is a 30-year-old neighborhood that I don't believe this expansion was designed in the road design to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14350)|
| 3:59:19| So this is going to create a hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14359)|
| 3:59:22| I can assure you I leave that neighborhood every morning and come home during rush hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14362)|
| 3:59:27| and there are already challenges entering and coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14367)|
| 3:59:30| The flow of traffic is about 55 miles an hour on Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14370)|
| 3:59:35| So when you're trying to take a left-hand turn and exit and coming in, those 342 additional trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14375)|
| 3:59:41| there is, to me, a foreseeable issue that there are going to be an increased risk for traffic accidents at that junction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14381)|
| 3:59:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14390)|
| 3:59:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14392)|
| 3:59:53| Mark, I guess the other sort of additional question to that in terms of, and I'm not, I can't visualize the whole situation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14393)|
| 4:00:01| but my experience with the speed humps also is that it has the effect of changing traffic patterns for those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14401)|
| 4:00:13| not just slowing them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14413)|
| 4:00:15| And so in this situation, would there be a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14415)|
| 4:00:19| I mean, I'm just asking you to give me your estimation of what that would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14419)|
| 4:00:26| Would that change traffic patterns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14426)|
| 4:00:28| Would guys go, I don't like those two humps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14428)|
| 4:00:30| I'm going this way, and I'm going this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14430)|
| 4:00:33| Yeah, if they have options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14433)|
| 4:00:35| Okay, would the options be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14435)|
| 4:00:37| The options would be there with that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14437)|
| 4:00:40| Within the existing subdivision, there's a relatively highly connected road system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14440)|
| 4:00:45| with three access points to the surrounding arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14445)|
| 4:00:48| So once into the established subdivision, there are some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14448)|
| 4:00:55| Okay, that's good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14455)|
| 4:00:57| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14457)|
| 4:00:59| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14461)|
| 4:01:02| You talked about building up friction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14462)|
| 4:01:06| Whenever you build up friction, the more you stack it, the more friction you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14466)|
| 4:01:10| But when you have a road to enter that has a center turn lane and you spread that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14470)|
| 4:01:17| the more you spread it out, the more you ease the friction, ease the tension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14477)|
| 4:01:21| because it's easier to get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14481)|
| 4:01:23| So I definitely would say it needs to be coming out onto Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14483)|

| 4:01:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14490)|
| 4:01:32| The staff proposal, was it for both of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14492)|
| 4:01:37| Are there two roads there called Halifax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| It's one loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14499)|
| 4:01:40| That's a loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14500)|
| 4:01:42| Well, it says Rygate on the east-west, Halifax on the north-south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14502)|
| 4:01:50| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14510)|
| 4:01:51| Were both Halifaxes going to be extended into the property and make a loop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14511)|
| 4:01:55| No, just the one on the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14515)|
| 4:01:57| It's just the one that is the easternmost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14517)|
| 4:02:01| We don't own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14521)|
| 4:02:05| The part that is the westernmost stub road doesn't adjoin our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14525)|
| 4:02:15| If you look at the map, it's only that hatched area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14535)|
| 4:02:18| So there's a parcel in the back that's not included in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14538)|
| 4:02:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14542)|
| 4:02:23| Okay, so what you're proposing is that there just be a single road bisecting your development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14543)|
| 4:02:34| with a cul-de-sac at the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14554)|
| 4:02:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14556)|
| 4:02:37| It goes straight back off of Ebenezer and cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14557)|
| 4:02:40| One way in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=14560)|
