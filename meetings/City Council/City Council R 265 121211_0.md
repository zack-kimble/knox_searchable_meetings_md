| 0:04:52| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| And the consent items, there's just one, 12G, that's a 202 allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| The Mayor's Report, I'm going to have to read it off my phone, because I actually had it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| already, and I must have left it upstairs, or else it's somewhere here I can't find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| But first, I just want to, I guess, acknowledge, you all know this, the Brookings Institute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| put out a report since we last met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| This is their annual Global Metro Monitor, where they look at the 300 of the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| metropolitan areas in the world, actually, and of the cities in the United States that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=340)|
| 0:05:49| they looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| And Knoxville was one of three cities that, according to their data, has fully recovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| from the recession, along with Dallas and Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| So we got quite a bit of coverage locally, and some national coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| I was actually on National Public Radio, I guess it was yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=365)|
| 0:06:13| And we're really thrilled to see that compared to these other metro areas that we are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=373)|
| 0:06:21| this well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| I wouldn't say we fully recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| We all know we've got more work to do, but certainly in comparison with these other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| that they've looked at, it's certainly a good sign for Knoxville, and one we want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| sure others know about, so they can come and take us a look or feel more comfortable as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| they expand or grow in our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| I also want to thank Dogwood Arts for the sculpture Columns, called Columns, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| created by the artist Kenneth Thompson and was gifted to the city's public art collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| I think some of you all were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| Deputy to the mayor, Eddie Maness, accepted the gift on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| And we know that making art accessible inspires our community and encourages local artists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| to create even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| So we're very grateful for that gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| So we've got a couple of recognitions tonight of city staff and city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| I want to recognize our finance department and our finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| Jim, come on down to the podium if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| Jim York is our senior finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| And so Jim and his finance department received the, for the 25th year, received the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=448)|
| 0:07:41| finance officers association certificate of achievement for excellence in financial reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| Is that this one or this is the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| Here's the little one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| So the city has received this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| And Jim's been here 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| City's received it 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| So he's kept this going for all that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| And what this is, is this is an award for our comprehensive annual financial report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| And this is always a year lag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| This is for fiscal year ending in June 30th of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| It's a big honor to get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| It's a national organization that promotes the professional management of governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| through financial policies and best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| And so they work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| You all know our finance department works very hard to make sure that the financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| integrity of Knoxville is upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| And for that, we thank you, Jim, and all of your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Please share them with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| And we're going to let them hang this again up in the finance department with all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| other plaques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| And also, we don't have a plaque yet, but they were also recognized, we just found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| on Monday, that a panel of independent reviewers with the GFOA has awarded the department a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Distinguished Budget Presentation Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| This award is the highest form of recognition in governmental budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| In order to receive the award, a governmental unit must publish a document that meets program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| criteria as a policy document, an operations guide, a financial plan, and a communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| So we are proud to say that our budget presentation met all of these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| And so again, thank you, Jim, for what you do and for your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| Please let us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| And this is the 24th year that we've received this one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| And you've been here 24 years, so we will note that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| Hour of saying no that's really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| And also, I want to now recognize the Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Is Becky here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Oh, there's Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| She doesn't have anything on the agenda tonight, I guess, so she's sitting in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| So having been the former Director of Community Development, I understand how important this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| is that we receive this recognition from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| It is the letter that you get after they do their consolidated...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| After you do your CAPER, which is the Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| And this is where they look back and see how you did with all the money that you got in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| And HUD officials were pleased to announce that there were no findings or concerns with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| the City's HOME program, which is our affordable housing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| The report also found a number of noteworthy accomplishments, including significant progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| to provide safe, decent, and affordable housing, grants being used to support agencies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| assist the homeless, and the completion of nine new façade projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| So congratulations to Becky for your leadership and to all the Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| So a lot of good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| That is the end of my report, so reports from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Councilman Dallivante.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| I have two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| One is, I know I speak for my colleagues when we extend our thoughts and prayers to former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| City Attorney Sharon Boyce and her husband, Jack Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| They lost their daughter this weekend up in Lexington in a terrible, tragic accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| A fine young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| The other one is a happier note, but I'm still choked up from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| I learned today that Apple has now approved the Knoxville app, and it's already available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| on Google for downloading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Can I Google it right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| I think Apple might be tomorrow or the next day, but they have approved it for downloading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| from the App Store, so you'll be able to navigate our fine city with your phone and know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| you are, and know what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=714)|

| 0:12:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I just wanted to announce that the assigned task force, instead of meeting tomorrow, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| meet next Tuesday, the 18th, same time, same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| That will be December 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Also, Mayor, I just wanted to make a comment that I thought we had a terrific parade for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| Christmas, and the crowds were great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| The parade ran very smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| I want to thank everybody from the police to the fire to all the city employees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| were involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=748)|

| 0:12:37| for that, Cumulus, WIVK and the Cumulus Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| We appreciate all of their effort towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Let's go to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| 8A is the resolution electing Kathy Hamilton and Celeste Herbert to the Knoxville Utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=770)|

| 0:26:50| I'm just curious, this sounds like a neat way to get our police force mounted on motorcycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1610)|
| 0:27:00| and patrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Do we ever buy the vehicles or just lease them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Is this a traditional thing we've been doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| How about we can get the chief here to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Keith, either you or I can handle it, but yes, we do this, it's an economical way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| We do not buy the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| We lease them, and it's an economical way as well as the repairs that get done on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| are at a lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| It's a two-year warranty, so it ties in nicely with the lease agreement we have with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Do you keep them after the two years, or do you just turn them back and get a new set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| In this case, we've got a one-year renewable option, and at the time comes, after two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| we'll get with the chief and decide what they want to do, much like we're doing with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| But you've done a comparative over the years in terms of cost of keeping up the vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| and this is a better way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1668)|

| 0:27:50| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1670)|

| 0:28:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Councilman Bellovopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Yeah, I guess I know the answer to this based on the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| But, Cindy, this kind of blew me away, just leasing tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| I never thought of doing that myself, but it's an interesting idea and a way to save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| I gather you've been doing it for a lot of years, according to the AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Could you tell us just briefly how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Cindy McGinnis, general manager of CAT 301 Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| This is a customary practice in the transit industry to lease the tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| We only pay for the value of the tire that we use, and we end up saving a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| doing it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Plus, we end up not going through a wholesaler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| We can deal directly with the manufacturer of the tire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| So it's served the transit industry well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| So you save money by doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Yes, over $100,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| And does your maintenance staff decide when it's time to switch out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| If you get too technical, I'll have to get our maintenance director to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| How long do you lease them for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| What's the duration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| This is a three-year lease period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| But depending on the size of the tire and the type of vehicle that the tire is used on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| will depend on the wear that you get from the tire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| You've got some small buses and big buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Thank you, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1797)|

| 0:30:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| We had a question about Joe earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| I don't know if he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I guess my question, Joe, is can we use any of those dollars to actually build the greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| or we're just going to assess them and figure out what it's going to cost to build them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| and then move from there and digging into our own pocketbook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| Joe Wall, Sparks Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| These funds are strictly for planning purposes, Council, not for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| But hopefully they would lead us to the next step which would allow us to get funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| future greenways after we've had time to assess costs and feasibility of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Do you use the studies to apply for grant money or whatever from the feds or the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| We certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| The information we'll gather will go a long way toward the application that we would put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| together that would identify the exact route and the preliminary costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| How do you identify the corridors that go into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| In other words, which ones are you going to study or any corridor you think you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| potential to develop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| We'll sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| We'll do an RFP and select an outside firm to do the analysis and we'll sit down with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| them and we'll look at what we consider maybe the 10 or 15 top priority corridors connecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| greenways with greenways or greenways with parks and then we'll let them maybe pick the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| top four or five or six that they think are most feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1903)|

| 0:32:47| But anyway, I just want to recognize the great work that Carol Evans does and Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1967)|
| 0:32:56| and all the folks that support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=1976)|

| 0:34:22| I realize it borders the downtown as well as that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| But we're going to turn an empty factory, sort of abandoned factory, if you will, into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2063)|

| 0:34:50| Forty-two residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| The proposed developers are in the audience here tonight too if you have any specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| But it is very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| We are going to the Magnolia Warehouse District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| We're moving out to Central Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| So a lot of this whole strategy from the inside out is paying off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| And we're going to get more people living downtown and that increases the activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| that goes on downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| I, as well, am very excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| The one sort of concern I had is the pedestrian access from the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| Are you working with engineering on that, or does something need to be done on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| We've had several conversations with a couple of folks in engineering, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| We recognize the situation crossing railroad tracks between Depot and Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| It's not a great situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| There's plenty of asphalt to walk on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| There's not a designated sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| We're thinking maybe there's a way we can do some striping that might help us in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| As a part of either an old city improvement project or a north central improvement, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| a chance we could do something there, but when you deal with the railroad, you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| have to take it slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| But yes, sir, we're aware of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| All right, now, before we go on to the ordinances on first reading, I just want to remind everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| that our next meeting of city council, normally it would fall on two weeks from today, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| would be Christmas Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| For some reason, you all chose to not meet that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| So instead, the meeting is a week from this Thursday, which is December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| And so as a result, all of these ordinances that are on first reading, the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| will not be until the January 8th council meeting because we have to have two full weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| by, I guess, our charter in order, you know, before you can read it a second time, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| weeks has to have passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| So that will be January 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| However, we will all be back here on December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 17, Articles 2 and 6, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| allow car-sharing business vehicles to be parked in designated spaces for long periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| and to authorize the removal and impoundment of non-car-sharing vehicles parked in such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| designated spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2231)|

| 0:38:05| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| That completes the agenda, but we have a person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2286)|
| 0:38:15| David Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Is David still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| Mr. Howard, if you'd come forward and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| And according to our rules, you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| I'm going to try my best to comply with that five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| My name is David Howard and I reside at 346 East Moody Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| I attended and spoke at the December 6th public hearing held by TDOT regarding the plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| solve the problems plaguing Chapman Highway through construction of the James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| Comments made at the hearing by Mayor Rogero, Vice Mayor Pavlis, and other speakers who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| oppose the parkway have compelled me to present this question to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Where is your problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Where is your plan to fix Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| There were numerous reasons offered for altering construction of the parkway, ranging from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| the so-called rebranding of South Knoxville as an urban wilderness to the let them eat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| cake approach, which was a little less clearly defined, but the gist of it was this let them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| go around South Knoxville or let them suffer because we do not appreciate the burden of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| their traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| There was a litany of speakers who expressed their desire to see Chapman Highway fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| while opposing any impact on businesses and homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| We all know that's unrealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| The majority of the comments offered by the opposition demonstrated that few, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| had even bothered to look at the draft EIS which was being discussed at the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| The draft EIS Executive Summary, which is laid out in the first 14 pages of this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| succinctly lays out the possible impacts of building the parkway and the probable impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| of not building it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| As most of us know, if we build it, we must sacrifice homes, businesses, and undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| tracks along the project path to connect high-growth areas along the Knox-Sevier County line with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| downtown and our interstate system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| This is clearly a priority for a majority of the traffic on Chapman Highway since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| data collected for this project and presented at the meeting revealed that two-thirds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| the northbound Chapman Highway traffic continue on to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| If we do not build the parkway, we continue to burden a growing population in our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| with gridlock and unacceptably dangerous conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| The draft EIS even touched on some of the more mercurial offerings made at this hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| like mass transit, but as the document points out, none of these offerings are considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| reasonable alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| There was also discussion about the economic impact of the project on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| with one speaker going as far as to take a virtual walk down memory lane listing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| numerous businesses that have come and gone over the last several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Interestingly, this speaker opposed the parkway because he felt the businesses in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| needed the traffic, while wholly ignoring the fact that the businesses were struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| and failing before the Henley Bridge closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| Some of the speakers objected to diverting through traffic to the parkway, only to dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| it back on the Chapman Highway at John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| TDOT representatives indicated that improvements were already being implemented along that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| corridor south of the road, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| There was an even individual who identified himself as a math professor at UT, certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| not mathematically challenged, who made much ado about previous TDOT traffic projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| which proved to be inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| This individual totally ignored the actual, unacceptably high number of vehicles which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| are currently, not projected, currently, traveling this deadly section of Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Additionally, I pointed out during my speech that those same flawed TDOT projections from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| the 60s and even the 80s wholly failed to forecast the westward population explosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| which has consumed so much real estate between the city of Knoxville and the western boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| That's the problem with projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| They're really just best guesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Vice Mayor Pavlis gave a rousing speech to the faithful, even pointing out that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| put a man on the moon so we should be able to fix Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| That was great style without substance soundbite, but there was no plan offered to solve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| deadly problem our citizens face daily on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| Mayor Rojero, who I voted for during her election, voiced her opposition to the extension without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| the euphoric man on the moon rhetoric, but again, no plan, no solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| I'm appalled at the irresponsible positions advocated by our City Mayor and Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| Furthermore, I fail to see how this administration can support the Cumberland Avenue Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| Project with its stated goal, and I quote, to chart the course for a more attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| economically successful, vibrant, and safe Chapman Avenue, unquote, while encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| a head in the sand approach to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| South Knoxville needs a safe corridor, and we have been promised one, for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| The reasoning for the parkway has changed somewhat, but the necessity is greater now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| So, again, I ask, where is your plan for Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| Okay, there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| We'll see you on December 20th, 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121211?start=2593)|
