| 0:03:42| engaging neighborhood leaders for coming out and supporting the 2019 Neighborhood Conference last Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| As always, this free event is a great way for community leaders to network, to learn from one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| to gather new ideas about what works best, and to be proactive in solving problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| Neighborhood coordinator Debbie Sharp, who's here with us tonight, her staff and the volunteers did a really tremendous job with this year's conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=240)|

| 0:05:21| So this week is National Public Works Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| It's a perfect time to thank the city employees who pave our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| manage stormwater, build sidewalks and greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| clear ice and snow in the winter, and maintain our parks and playgrounds, just to mention a few of their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| This week our Communications Department will be featuring Public Works employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| on the City of Knoxville Facebook page and on the city blog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| which you can find at www.knoxvilletn.gov slash city blog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| Look for posts and anecdotes highlighting the great work being done by folks in city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| fleet services, parks and rec, plans review and inspections, and public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Actually, I've seen some of those. They're really well done, and more will be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| Look for the hashtags Public Works Week, and it starts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| And by all means, when you see the crew out working in your neighborhood, give them a run in the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| Please let them know how much you appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| All right, here's a ribbon-cutting to mark your calendar for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| This is, we will be dedicating a new half-mile soft-surface trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| at the Cumberland Estates Recreation Center tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| That's Wednesday, May 22nd at 4 p.m. The address is on Silver Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| We're thankful for the really great job that our Public Service Department greenways crew did in building that trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| And we're proud that the after-school children who used the rec center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| opted to name the trail in honor of Recreation Specialist Yolanda Crow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| who has been working at the rec center for the past eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| Fittingly, the kids selected this name. They want it called the Crow's Nest, in her honor, which is pretty nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| Also to put on your calendar, Nikki Giovanni is coming back to Knoxville this Thursday, May 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| for a very special unveiling of a Mulvaney Street historic marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| Ms. Giovanni is a world-acclaimed author, educator, and poet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| a Virginia Tech distinguished professor, and a Knoxville native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| She was born at the old Knoxville General Hospital, grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| but spent summers with her grandparents at their home at 400 Mulvaney Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| which has since been renamed Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Nikki and her sister played at Cal Johnson Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| and she studied at Austin High School before graduating with honors from Fisk University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| One of Giovanni's best-known essays is called 400 Mulvaney Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| It recounts her grief at the loss of her grandparents' house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| and the surrounding African-American neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| Cal Johnson Park is all that remained of the cherished Mulvaney Street of Giovanni's childhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| So I look forward to unveiling this marker and hearing her read her Knoxville, Tennessee poem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| So again, the unveiling will be at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Cal Johnson Rec Center at Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| Also remember that Monday, May 27th, is Memorial Day, and the city of Knoxville offices will be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| However, the Waste Connection crews will be following their regular schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| for residential trash and recyclable pickups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| So if you have your normal collection on Monday like I do, then remember to put your carts out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=518)|
| 0:08:47| Also, full details about holiday closures and services are available on our website at knoxvilletn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=527)|
| 0:08:57| And one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Council has at their desk, and I assume we've got some extra copies if anybody wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| Do you have any extra, Erin? We can get some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| Okay, so this is a set of new goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| As you all know, we've made significant progress towards the sustainability goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| that were set more than a decade ago under the Haslam administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| There were some skeptics, and we said we would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 20% by the year 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| for both municipal operations and the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| The good news is that in just a few months, we will exceed our municipal goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| when we complete our LED streetlight retrofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| With 2020 just around the corner, it is time to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| what the next generation of sustainability goals might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Tonight, I'd like to formally introduce these proposed goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| which we hope will inspire continued leadership toward reduced carbon emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| and a more sustainable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| First, a city government should lead by example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| with the goal of reducing municipal greenhouse gas emissions 50% by the year 2030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| This goal is ambitious, but we think it's realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| With steady leadership, the city can make smart, fiscally responsible investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| and operational innovations that achieve significant emission reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| while still maintaining high-quality services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Second, we must aspire for deep community progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| and here we aim to reduce emissions 80% by the year 2050 for the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=631)|
| 0:10:39| This is a bold, aspirational goal that requires changes to many systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| outside of city government control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| But the city is an agent of change, and our commitment can motivate leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| from many other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| In proposing these goals, we are very aware that it will be up to future mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| and council members to direct specific projects, programs, and policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| that allow Knoxville to make progress towards these targets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| The goals themselves don't spell out any specific investment or action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| But just as we inherited the aspirational goals for 2020 set by Mayor Haslam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| and have worked to achieve them and will achieve our municipal goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| the next mayor and council will inherit the goals we set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| By setting our compass on a drastically lower-carbon future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| we can unlock a continued spirit of innovation, collaboration, and leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| to ensure a more sustainable and equitable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| This is a future that protects our environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| while creating inclusive economic opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| and improving the quality of life for all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| So our sustainability director, Erin Gill, has met individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| with all council members to prepare these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| She will now work with council to bring a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| by which city council can formally vote to endorse these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| In the meantime, sustainability staff will continue to discuss these goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| with council as well as with any community members who are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| We've posted additional information about the proposed goals on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| which is knoxvilletn.gov slash sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| So I do want to thank our sustainability director, Erin Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| and project manager, Brian Blackman, for their focus, drive, and their creativity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| which have helped guide us toward reaching our 2020 goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| So we will hopefully bring that back for you all to formally vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| And I know you're familiar with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| You've all talked with Erin, but we're pretty excited about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| and look forward to further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| That is the end of my report, council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| I just wanted to thank my colleagues for their endurance, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| and their good humor, and their preparedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| in the numerous meetings we are having this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| This is the fifth meeting of council this month, and we have one meeting left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| That's May 30th, Thursday next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Not this week, but Thursday next week at 3 p.m. here in the main assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| to continue to consider the recode proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=798)|

| 0:13:26| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Mayor, I just want to thank you and Erin for putting these goals together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| I think it's really something I look forward to developing that resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| for the next council and the next mayor to achieve those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| I think it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| You had them, and you could work on them and tweak them as you like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| and send them to the next administration and do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| It's outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| This is our biggest asset that we have here is our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| and protecting that is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| So I'm really, really proud to be a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| and I look forward to that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| I just want to make a quick comment about the recycle center fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| that happened a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| The city was notified by multiple neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| from within the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood about Fort Lowndes recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| potentially bringing additional materials to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| The city fire marshal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| and neighborhood codes personnel responded to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| and issued a stop work order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| I believe that was yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| I'll let David Brace make a comment if he has some additional words to add to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| but the city is aware of the concerns from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| and is addressing those issues as allowable under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| So I know a lot of people are upset about what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| especially this recent behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| but there's a hearing, I believe, next Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| and those concerns will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| And I don't know if the administration wants to add anything to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| but I just wanted to state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| I think Fire Chief Schor was going to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Yeah, we've heard those concerns, and like you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| we have followed up the fire marshal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| or one of the fire marshal's representatives has been there almost on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| They're out there again today, along with the building codes official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| to make sure that no new material is coming to that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and that they're following the orders as put forth by the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=918)|

| 0:15:48| so we'll all try our best this year, and we'll see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| We'll put a repeat before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=953)|

| 0:17:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| I wanted to continue the discussion that Councilman Crampton had started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| with asking Chief Sharp about the environmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| if there are any environmental issues to be concerned of due to the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1047)|
| 0:17:35| That's something I do know that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| the only thing we've followed up on that is we've done air monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| occasionally just to make sure that there was nothing still being put out in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| And our results have come back positive on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I mean, everything has come back negative with, you know, nothing detected at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| Stormwater, I know, has been also monitoring the runoff from that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| and they would have to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1080)|

| 0:19:13| Ms. Avery, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| And, as you know, there's a timer up above my head here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| My name is Constance Avery, 301 North Trew Howie Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| Yeah, I already said that, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Okay, so let's talk about this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| This budget is foolish to me, in all honesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| We're talking about spending roughly $20 million on a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| There's been a commitment of roughly about $4 million towards the homeless project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| But if you look in detail to what the homeless project is actually stating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| it's a reality of roughly about really $2 million going into homeless projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| And then you look at, like, the community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| things of that necessity that are given to the nonprofit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| There was once upon a time a commitment of an increase to that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| However, that has also been reduced about roughly by $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| When I look at this budget, I look at it as rule number one in business is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| the business bank account is never your personal bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| This is people's money, taxpayers' money at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| So this is the people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| And when I watch people sit here and make decisions with a budget that's supposed to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| the mass population of 800,000-plus people in this city, I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| $20 million in a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| Insane, when we have things that are in much dire need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| I said, you know, it's crazy, if you take $20 million and actually used it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| and dispersed it across the city for the good of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| it would probably do quite a bit of improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Our children like to play in gymnastics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| They like to do karate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| They like soccer and other activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Why not invest in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| The city's always talking about figuring out ways to drive down crime and gang interactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| and violence and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Well, that's one of the ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| We make our children so active and so busy in other activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| that they don't have time to be recruited by the gangs or involved in crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Or the next one, you talked about the city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Okay, we just went to the downtown, to the water park down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| and there's a tire swing that used to sit on one of the pieces of the park equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| Well, the swing is gone today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| You know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Because the chain broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| For some reason, the city doesn't feel the necessity to put the swing back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| even though my kids love that swing, and it's not there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Another thing that we could invest into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| We have a serious drug usage problem in our homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| We're always talking about rehabilitating these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Why not create a real drug rehab facility that they could actually enter into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| and really get drug rehab assistance with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| I mean, there's so many ways we could spend this money other than calling ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| quote, unquote, e-commercing our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| I talked to downtown Knoxville business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| As a matter of fact, I talked to one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| He's a tech guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| When I was talking to him about the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| and how this budget was supposed to increase revenues for the businesses in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| he flat out told me, I'm not going to get any increase in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| because it doesn't cater to my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| He's like, the only ones that have a real advantage to the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| are your bars and restaurants, because obviously when the people come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| they go to these facilities to drink and participate, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| so they're going to make the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| But people like my dude who has a tech company down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| what money is he going to make off of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| That's the answer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| When I sit here and I watch these city officials that once again are elected to this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| and I sit here and watch y'all make these budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| and how y'all going to spend our people's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| it makes me once again remind the people, foolish us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| We voted the wrong people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Because look at what they're doing with our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| How we could have better our communities in multiple ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| yet these are the ways they think are best in the betterment of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| When I watch the poor people suffer day in and day out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| And some of y'all have the audacity to want to run for farther positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Some of y'all want to be mayors next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Some of y'all want to try to pursue the Congress and Senator seats around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| Well, it ain't going to happen, because I'm going to tell you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| As long as I sit here and watch people and keep track of these track records that you are performing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| I'm going to make sure to let the people know they do not get our vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| because they're not in the interest of our people at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| Their interests are selfish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| That's why we got an out-of-state California contractor here in the first place doing all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| We are in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| I know there were multiple in-state contractors available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Or even for that matter, you could have stayed in the southeast region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| I would have even been able to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| But I am very confused why we went all the way west to California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| to bring out-of-state contractors in here that cost more money to do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| that we're asking for to be done in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| As well as the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| I just went to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| We just talked about body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| $20 million will definitely cover the body cameras that we need in our police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| because currently the video footage that they offer only goes up to 100 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| That's not useful for anybody, because once the camera disappears out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| it's my word versus what the cop says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| And we already all know that's not dependable in any of these storylines we've been watching on national news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| So I'm going to be honest with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| I am disgusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| I am disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| I don't know who's supposed to be fully held accountable for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| but I will admit, if you make this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| then look forward to the next election campaign and not be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| because this is something that will not be forgotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| and we will remind the taxpayers of your actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Council, just to clarify, there is no money in this budget for baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| There is not $20 million or zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| There is no money in this budget for baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| The next speaker is Mr. David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Mr. David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| As you know, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Yes, my name is David Hayes, 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| I'm glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| So how is this budget failing our communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Four reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Lack of human rights and democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Inadequate funding to social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Inadequate employee salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| And inequality and gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| So the lack of human rights and democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| I talked about that a lot last time, just briefly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| So there's been no community engagement or participation in the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Open meetings are not enough to engage and participate with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| That's insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| And the budget is not even meant to meet the needs of people in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| And there are no accountability measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| or real community oversight for the budget or city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| And because of no human rights, there's inadequate funding in social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| The total spending for the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| which includes park, neighborhood, sustainability, community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| which includes affordable housing, parks and rec, CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| grants to community organizations and the community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| that's about $37 million, 8% of total spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Meanwhile, the police get $60 million, 14% of total spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| And if you add in the money for the police station that y'all reserved for them last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| they're getting $100 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| compared to the $37 million social services are getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| Full-time staff for social services, admin, community development, parks and rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| that's 101 people, only 19 in community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| So that's about 6% of the total employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Police, 519.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| One-third of all city employees are police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| The city is not addressing the root causes of crime or harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| The city does not adequately address poverty or its effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| Let's move on to another point, inadequate employee salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| So despite the increases in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| this budget still pays poverty wages to workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Every city worker deserves a living wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| especially public service workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| The mayor was just talking about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| So they essentially run the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| They include garbage collection, brush and leaf collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| ice and snow removal, facility and street maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| horticulture services, so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| I talked to a public service manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| He's been working for around 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| He's only making about $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| Now police officers right out of the academy now are going to be making $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| He's been working for 15 years around then, only making $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| In his team of around two dozen folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| none of them make over $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| So police shouldn't be the only workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| who start with living wages and good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And addressing poverty reduces crime and harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| So paying poverty wages is actually the opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| of addressing the root causes that your city is trying to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Inequality and gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| The city was recently ranked third in the U.S. in growing inequality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| A poverty rate is 27%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| A poverty rate for kids under 18 is 37%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| A poverty rate in the black community is at least 41%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| And there's an inadequate response to energy burdens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| that families are suffering from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| So it's clear that black and brown and working class communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| are getting exploited and displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| When I say working class, I mean those in poverty, low income, no income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| and also folks in lower middle income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Because, you know, it's people who are making an all right amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| but still can't afford the rising rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| At the last State of the City's address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| the mayor said our strategy has been to invest from the city of Knoxville out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| and said this model has been tremendously successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| It's been successful at displacing black, brown, and working class people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| Very successful at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| This ballpark, instead of saving money, which you said you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| you said you've reserved space and money in borrowing capacity, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| So instead of saving money for an adequate of, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| so actually instead of where you've actually saved money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| in borrowing capacity for a ballpark by smokers in the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| you could have used that money to actually fund an affordable housing trust fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| which you don't have in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| You have a rental fund but not an affordable housing trust fund, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| So in this ballpark, communities are fearing that we will continue to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| gentrification and displacement and inequality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Knoxville College, last year the city said you would invest in Knoxville College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| in exchange for a police station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| When the community spoke and the police station wasn't an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| the city refused to invest in Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Knoxville College deserves funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| The urban building is a South Knoxville investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| investing millions of dollars in trolleys and bus shelters for new condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| It's becoming a middle-class playground at the expense of working-class folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| So in conclusion, I just want to reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| this budget is failing our communities because of its lack of human rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| and democracy, inadequate funding to social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| inadequate employee salaries, and its promotion of inequality and gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| I just wanted to let everyone know that a grant that is in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| is for community schools, which is a strategy that is done in partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| with Great Schools Partnership and Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| Community schools is under an organization that I run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| The funds will go directly to staff who are in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| and will in no way affect my salary or compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| or go in any way towards my pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| So I will be voting on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| I just wanted to disclose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| And for the record, we have funded them before you became a city councilperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| My wife, Sarah, works as the development director for the Sertoma Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| I'm disclosing this as there's a grant in the budget we're considering today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| for the Sertoma Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| The Sertoma Center has made similar grants to the Sertoma Center in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| over the past five years and actually beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| My wife's income will not change as a result of this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| and I disclose this out of an abundance of caution with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| who found that this does not present a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| As there is no conflict and I have made this disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| I intend to vote on these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| And, again, we've supported Sertoma Center every year I've been mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| and prior to that for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Singh Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| In pursuit of accurate information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| I wanted to ask about in the budget about why we chose not to do an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| Affordable Housing Trust Fund this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| And I'd like to direct my questions to Becky Wade, if you wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| We actually do have an Affordable Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| We've had one for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| but it's funded through the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| But we have chosen, I'll answer this for Becky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| because it's a policy decision that we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Instead, we invested the Affordable Rental Development Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| We have CDBG and home dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| We actually have, plus we invest in KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| So we invest over $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| This year alone we will invest over $10 million in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Is there anything else to add to that, Becky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| No, I wanted to say that the City of Knoxville has an Affordable Housing Trust Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| that was established in 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| It's the oldest in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| It's implemented by the East Tennessee Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| and there is funds in this budget for that Affordable Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| They do not focus on the development of rental housing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| Their mission is focused on affordable home ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| and it has been since the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| And since the need in the community we recognized several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| was to help develop new affordable rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| that is why the Affordable Rental Development Fund was established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| I misspoke a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| What I'm asking about is what Justice Knox had requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| that trust fund where it would be dedicated funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| I know that they didn't approach you this year, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| but they had approached the mayoral candidate seeing if they would work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| I'll answer that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I've met with them numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| I went to one of their meetings, public big assemblies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| and we agree on the need for more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| We disagree on the way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Their strategy is through an Affordable Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| We had already established an Affordable Rental Development Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| and, of course, we had our existing fund, Affordable Housing Trust Fund, as Becky just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| We also had for years been investing at KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| and have upped what the previous administration's commitment was in order for five points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| This budget has the beginning of Austin Homes redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| and we have our CDBG and home dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| So we already had a very full plate and strategy for how to achieve affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| You may recall in my budget address I mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| and just since during my administration between us using city dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| working with nonprofit housing partners for profit and public such as KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| together all of us have spent about $230 million in the last seven and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| of which $42 million was directly from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| Affordable Housing Trust was leveraged through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| and over something like, I don't have the numbers in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| but 4,700 or so units have been impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| or some of which are completed in 800 or so are in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| So we agree with Justice Knox on the need for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| We have been very aggressive in pursuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| We just disagree on the way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2117)|

| 0:35:21| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Can I just ask Mr. York a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| We spent an entire day going through the budget, the collective whole up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| In addition, some of us were able to attend the mayor's budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| and were able to vet it there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| Just off the top of your head, because you're very good at citing things off the top of your head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| how much of the city budget is, because I don't have my binder in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| how much of the city budget is wages and benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| On the general fund side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| It depends on whether you include transfers or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| But if you exclude transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| the total amount devoted to salaries and wages in the general fund is roughly 75% of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2163)|
| 0:36:12| And it's going to vary by department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Some departments have a little bit more, but probably the lowest in a single department is probably 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| So that includes benefits as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| That does include salaries, benefits, including pension, health care, dental, a whole variety of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2184)|
| 0:36:33| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| So a large portion of the budget is for the staff and the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| And as we say, we are a service organization, and that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2206)|

| 0:47:17| and they have to mill and pave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| So the light at the end of the tunnel is growing fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| End of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2849)|

| 0:47:33| We will be done by end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2853)|

| 0:47:39| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Last time it was for council, we talked about the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| Has he still been working on the project all this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| He's that far behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| He's still working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| He didn't give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| He didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| And you're pursuing him for liquidated damages for the amount he's been over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| And the chances of collecting on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| We just don't pay the full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| So that's easy to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| It's not a matter of collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2895)|

| 0:48:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| with Charles Bailey Lock and Sons Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| for an amount not to exceed $3,317,355.40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| for the construction of the Knoxville Urban Wilderness Gateway Park infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| I know this is in our packet, and we've heard a lot about the Urban Wilderness Gateway Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| but I'm just wondering if Mr. Hagerman or Mr. Brace could just give us a real brief update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| about how this is being phased and the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| I am obviously very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| So just a little update would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| I'm sorry I didn't bring a timeline with me, so I'm not sure how long it's going to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| but I can get back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| This part of the project lays the framework for the new park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| that will be the takeoff point for the whole trail and park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| This is the first of two bid packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| This one will build parking areas, bring in the utilities for hooking up restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| They'll happen in the second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| Lighting comes in in this phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| We're widening the street decatur somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| and building half a mile of greenway to hook it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| So parking, street improvements, greenway, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| This phase, 180 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| I could have looked in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| 180 days on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Of course, usually we get started about six weeks after it gets passed by council as a rule of thumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| So 180 days after that, whenever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| Second phase, we'll put in the restrooms and the other real amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3015)|
| 0:50:23| Thank you, Mr. Rankin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Jim, it looked like you only had two companies bid on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| That's in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Were you surprised by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| They were pretty far apart in their bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Is it hard to find somebody to want to bid on a $3 million package?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| We did do an hour engineering estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| This was well within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| It was not an uncomfortable situation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| Sometimes when we get one or two bids, if they're above the estimate, it can be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| But if they're within the estimate, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| So it was within your estimate, your preliminary estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| And maybe even a little less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3076)|

| 0:54:14| There was another pilot in front of us a couple weeks ago, and looking at that, I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3254)|
| 0:54:33| not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| I spent a lot of time with the developer in the last couple days, and we had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| good conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| There's some things about this project that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| There's some things that I don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| What I do like is that the profit margin is at 6%, which to me is much more reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| than what was going on with, not to compare and contrast, but with the previous pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| This is something that it said that downtown still needs our assistance, and I'm feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| that that's not true anymore, but I also know that we've gone through a couple different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| opportunities with the Supreme Court site, and that nothing has panned out, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| not property that should be sitting there, and it really takes somebody who will be dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| to doing redevelopment work well, so I see all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| Where I still, and I gave pushback with the conversations that we had over the last couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| days, is it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| It's got a good profit margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| It's not that by giving a pilot, suddenly there's going to be tons of money being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| It's pretty minimal, but I would like to see these pilots somehow do something more for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3344)|
| 0:55:54| working class people in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| In talking about this, there were 300 jobs that were being created in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| There were also about 80 jobs that would be continuing forward through the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3364)|
| 0:56:12| and the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| We had conversations about raising the minimum wage on these jobs, making, there were a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3375)|
| 0:56:25| of allowances, and I know that there's so many ways that our hands are tied by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| We cannot require any affordable housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| We cannot require that there be a certain population that's local that you must hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| There are a lot of restrictions made, but even with all of this, I feel that this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| this fits more of the purpose of what a pilot is created for, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Bill, just help us break it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| This is, this property is pretty unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| It's been, had no tax basis to begin with, right, it was zero, and we had to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| We broke out into two parcels and assigned a price or value on one and then the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| and then just kind of walk us through that and talk us through the pilot structure and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| how you structured it and how it came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| As you mentioned, this has been producing zero taxes because it's been a public building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| It was a state, obviously a state building, a state Supreme Court, and we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| three efforts to try to get it redeveloped, which this is the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| The other two with the substantial pilots, they still couldn't work economically because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| of the difficulty of the site, especially with the requirements we put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| So with this, and once we did the request for proposals, all the proposers indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| they would need a TIF or a pilot to make this work, and we understood that when choosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Where we are now is because of the properties being divided into a hotel portion, or actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| an Airbnb type hotel, along with a residential portion, apartments, we've had to split these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| into two properties with two pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| And more of the value is on the apartment side, so the pilot, though it's 25 years for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| both, you will see that the taxes, that once they're apportioned, more of the taxes will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| be coming in from the apartment side, more of the value there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| So what we're doing is freezing the taxes at the purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| The purchase price is $2.6 million, which is what we had paid the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| So the city has now made whole on this, and we'll freeze it at the purchase price, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| then we'll have a payment of taxes in place for 25 years, a portion between the two properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| and we're hopeful that this will be the final leg on the journey, and we'll get out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| wilderness with this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| So they get three years for construction, and then 25 years after that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| So they'll pay the taxes on the $2.6 million that they're paying for it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| Yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| And then the increase, the value, so all total, I think, all total, he's got it at the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| investment a little over $72 million, almost $73 million, so the taxes on that is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| what we're waiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| And we're waiving, we're setting it aside for his, and helping his investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| So we're getting a little bit, we're getting more than we were before, even at $2.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| We're getting more, we're being made whole on our investment, and the four of us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| the five of the others were voted on that, whatever, a few years ago to acquire that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| for this very reason, to really be able to direct and influence and have some say in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| how this property's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| I mean, that was the whole reason behind it, to make sure it didn't turn into a blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| property forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| I mean, it is a sizable pilot, 25 years, it is the longest pilot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| And that does require state approval, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| It'll go to the state comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| Right, so it is one of our longer term pilots, and I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| So I just, I think it probably warranted that kind of conversation, and it took a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| while to unwind all that when it was split out in two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| But anyway, thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| I don't know if this question goes to you, Mr. Lyons, or to Mr. Dover, but just two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| to refresh for public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| So there have been other pilots awarded to this site in the past, and those developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| failed to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Technically, Council approved one for what was called Met Plaza back in around 2008 area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3648)|
| 1:00:57| and that one, it took a while, but the developer, even with the 25-year-old pilot, wasn't able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| to make the project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| And that was going into the market crash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| That was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| That was prior to and following the market crash, and obviously that had a major impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| Then we did, at that point, we transferred, we were working with the state and with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| IDB in a rather convoluted model at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| At that point, we decided it would be a lot simpler if the city just purchased it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| did our own pilot, because we had to go through some governmental gymnastics to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| do the pilot with the state owning it, because the state can only do auctions, which is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| we get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| As Councilman Wallace said, we wanted to be stewards of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| We put out another request for proposals, got another series of proposals to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| We, in staff, prepared a 25-year-old, 25-year pilot to present to Council, but prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| our presenting it, the developer said, we have to withdraw, we just cannot make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| work because of the site and the expenses and the difficulties that we put on through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| our constraints when we issued the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| So this, yes, this is the third go-around with the pilot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| The first two, even with the pilots, just couldn't make it work economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| Third time's the charm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| You sure can say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| And just to clarify, I met with Mr. Dover, and this is the most expensive investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3731)|
| 1:02:22| in downtown, or third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| I believe this is a substantial, I'm trying to think of any, how much, this is more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3745)|
| 1:02:32| the Farragut, I believe, is that not true, Mr. Dover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| So yes, this is up at the top, if not the greatest of any that we've been involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| projects we've worked with, or any new construction I can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Well, it'll be great to see the site developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| I walked right past it going to the Convention Center the other day, and it's really been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| you know, a dead block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| It's a full city block that's been dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| It needs to be activated, and I hope this time around we get to that ribbon cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| and see it move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| And I will add that the developers have included working with public art along Church where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| we have a challenge in the streetscape environment, as well as addressing Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| So that enlivening the block was key to what this was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| We talked about that in a workshop on this project many moons ago, or maybe a year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Thank you, Mayor, and I want to thank my colleagues for your comments regarding this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| As I always tell my children, a little bit of something is better than a whole lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| nothing, which is what we have gotten from that property over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| And so I'm personally very excited to see this project finally moving forward and excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| about the possibilities of having more residents downtown, increased revenue downtown, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| increasing a strong workforce downtown as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=3833)|

| 1:07:07| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| My name is Barbara Bridges, 4536 Everwood Oak Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| I wanted to speak about the tips and the pilots going forward in the next budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4034)|
| 1:07:23| Knoxville is not the ghost town that it was 20 or 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| Knoxville has changed a lot in the past 20 or 30 years and it used to be they rolled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4051)|
| 1:07:38| up the sidewalks at 5 p.m. on Friday night and didn't roll them back out until Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| morning but now the city is thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| The downtown area is thriving, Gay Street is thriving, Market Square, the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| the campus, and the development is spreading out into other parts of the city like Happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| Holler and South Knoxville, East Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| The idea that corporations need the same type of tax incentives to invest in our city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4086)|
| 1:08:18| really disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| If people are telling you that it's not costing the city anything, that it's costing the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| nothing to give out these tax incentives, I think that's disingenuous too because you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| losing the revenue, the difference between the higher tax rate and the lower tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| for the duration of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| That's money that the city, those are opportunity costs that the city really can't afford when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| we have over a quarter of the city's population living in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| To continue to pour money into incentivizing developers I think is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4132)|
| 1:09:02| Developers have their agglomeration economies now that didn't exist 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| Developers have an economic incentive to invest in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| So I would encourage all of you to ease up on the TIFs and Pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| We need that tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| It's time for Knoxville to start realizing the tax base that was promised with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| early investments years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| The second thing I wanted to talk about is Sierra McCauley, who is in some ways a manifestation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4169)|
| 1:09:37| of the city's priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| I hope you remember who she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| She was a young woman in her 20s who was having a mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| Someone called 911 and the first responder was a police officer who ended up shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| and killing her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| From what I understand she was naked in the street cutting on herself with a knife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| Now I don't even want to get into whether or not the cop was justified or negligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| That's a whole other discussion for another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| I would hope that everybody in this room can agree that she never should have been in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| situation in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| That this woman had fallen through the cracks so many times that it cost her her life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| The police officer shouldn't have been in that situation either for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| There's no way to justify why this woman had no other recourse than to find herself there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4229)|
| 1:10:41| The city's priorities are such that a quarter of the budget goes into the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| That's not including the capital, the $40 million worth of new municipal bonds to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4248)|
| 1:10:57| for new headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| That includes all the equipment and all the technological improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| The police officers have recording device on their belt that sends a signal back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| a receiver in the car and when they pull the car into the headquarters it automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| uploads the data to a server and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| All of the hours and the money that's spent on maintaining this whole system is a waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4281)|
| 1:11:31| If the incident like the one where Sierra McCauley lost her life wasn't recorded at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| All of that money, all of that equipment, all of that time is out the window if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| not capturing the incidents that the whole system was designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| I would like for you to consider what justice for Sierra McCauley would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| This was a systemic failure from the mayor's office and the city council all the way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| to the cop who pulled the trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| This whole system failed that woman and she lost her life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| It's your job as city council people to make sure that you address the systemic problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4331)|
| 1:12:20| and fix them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Thank you ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Justice for Sierra McCauley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Dr. Duthie, please state your name and address for the record and as you know you have up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4345)|
| 1:12:39| to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| I don't know if it's a good thing if they know my name or don't know my name but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| getting to learn a lot of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| Greg Duthie, 4501 Plymouth, 30-year resident of Knoxville, taxpayer, numerous properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| I've been involved with city politics in past administrations, I've been re-energized and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| I like what you said mayor about the city being an agent of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| Some might see it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| My experience in the last month in particular says otherwise and thank you for being an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| agent of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| Mr. Brace, I'm not sure if your colleague Chad Weth is here tonight or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| I was hoping he'd come up to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| I want to personally thank David Brace and Chad Weth for their efforts in being agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4407)|
| 1:13:36| of change in the West Hills neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| What started as a passion and continues to be a passion in cleaning up the three historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4420)|
| 1:13:48| African American cemeteries has also changed into improving the neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4428)|
| 1:13:58| In particular, Councilwoman Seema Singh and Ellen Adcock who has had a long history with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4438)|
| 1:14:07| this city have been mentors to me, colleagues, and have worked very hard with me and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4447)|
| 1:14:15| to tackle this problem of the blighted cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| I want to thank also Chief Thomas and in particular I hope you extend our thanks from the Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| Association to Officers Grantham, Jordan, Chandler, Roberts, and Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4469)|
| 1:14:40| Often we hear a lot of negatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| I acknowledge some things that frustrate me and a lot of things in life including the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| But I can tell you those officers are committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| They have come to our aid when there's been questionable activity in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| And as Chad Weth told me in a recent meeting, he said, if it looks terrible, people will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| treat it terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| That means city lots, businesses, and cemeteries to name just a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| So this cleanup effort that I've spearheaded and have gained some assistance with neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4513)|
| 1:15:21| and with the city is really appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| We continue to work with Holly Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| I have a meeting with her tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| Historic preservation includes non-buildings like cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| I've also had some recent conversations with some politicians state and federal wise who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| are supportive of the efforts and there's been some talk about a National Historic Registry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| or something to that sort for the cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| There's also been some effort on part of the city of Knoxville to help us with securing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| the cemeteries to keep the garbage dumping and other illegal activity including drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| activity out of the cemeteries and out of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| We recently have had some efforts in what I'm calling partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| Home Depot helped us recently with securing some of the gates in the neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| they'll continue to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| There's also a landscape company, an ecological landscape planning company in Knoxville who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4585)|
| 1:16:33| volunteered to help us with some ideas for these three cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| As I've mentioned in the past and I'll add again, if anyone from the neighborhood is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| interested or in the city in helping with these cemeteries or improving the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| overall, we are re-energizing the neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| It is called Westview Community Action Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| It was spearheaded years ago by Ellen Adcock and she and I are re-energizing this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4620)|

| 1:17:47| listen to your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4667)|

| 1:18:12| I just wanted to bring attention, obviously it's already been brought to the attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| of the city council with the 4 Loudon Recycling Facility, but I just wanted to kind of make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4696)|
| 1:18:22| a face and put a little representation, also invite you all to our neighborhood meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| which happens on Monday the 3rd at 7 o'clock at the Clubhouse on Shamrock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| And now a lot of you that aren't in our district may be wondering why you would want to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4717)|

| 1:18:41| we need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| The fire department did a phenomenal job handling that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| I saw it from lots of different angles and perspectives, and it was pretty frightening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| for a lot of people in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| And I know that we have special meetings answering questions and things like that, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| a presence at the neighborhood meeting, especially maybe the upcoming meeting, especially what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| been going on with that facility with neighbors finding out what's been going on with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| of the trouble that's been happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| I've only lived in the neighborhood for a year, and from the first time that I moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| in there, I knew that that place was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Anytime we walked around there or did anything, it was just piles of garbage and just no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| ever was, it was, it's never been an asset for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| It's never, I don't see how it could be an asset as it goes right now as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| And that's really what Oakwood Lincoln Park needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| And I think just attending and letting those people know that you're listening to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| concerns because one of you guys are going to have it happen in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| Something's going to happen, some sort of tragedy may happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| And the way it was handled from our emergency officials could not give them more praise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| But on this backside with all of the, you know, the owner and the property owner going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| behind, you know, the backs of people to do things that they shouldn't be doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| I mean, it's just, you're kind of setting up an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| We all do from the neighborhood understand that there are illegal procedure that needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| to happen and needs to get followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| But I think that there are certain circumstances where, you know, the city needs to show the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| neighborhood that something's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| And after the fire got put out and people walked away, the tapes just flapping in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| gate and trucks are still driving through because nobody's really paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| So the follow-up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190521?start=4819)|
