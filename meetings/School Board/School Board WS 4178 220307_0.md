| 0:02:45| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=165)|
| 0:02:55| So do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| A motion by Ms. Horn, a second by Ms. Henderson. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| So our priority report in foundational academic skills, Dr. Ryslick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| Superintendent's report first. Sorry, superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| That's okay. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Board members, I'd like to begin by highlighting our virtual skates and plates fundraiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| which is sponsored by the Partners in Education Foundation and launched last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| In the 2022 school year, proceeds from the campaign will be used to provide scholarships for Knox County high school seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| help provide recreational equipment for schools, and fund identified needs for schools across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| The short campaign video is available at knoxschoolspie.org slash skatesandplates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| and I hope you will consider learning more about this important fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| On a similar note, I'd like to say thank you to the generous donors who helped purchase a playground at New Hopel Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| This was a project that held a ribbon cutting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| This initiative was supported by a $50,000 grant from the Boyd Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| a $17,000 donation from the Knoxville Academy of Medicine Alliance, and several other gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| I'm so grateful for all our community partners and especially those who helped make this project possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| I'm also pleased to announce that Knox County Schools will once again offer a free summer learning camp for eligible students this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| The elementary summer learning camp will run from May 31st through June 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| And the middle school summer bridge camp will be held from June 1st through June 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| Again, June 1st through June 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| These camps are an important chance for students to continue sharpening their skills in English language arts and math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| and eligible families will receive more information beginning this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| And finally, I want to remind everyone that our schools will be closed for spring break from March 14th through the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| Certainly hope that our students, teachers, and school employees are able to rest and relax during the break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| and we look forward to welcoming students back to class on Monday, March 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| Madam Chair, that concludes my report for this evening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| Thank you. Dr. Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Dr. Murphy and Ms. Shannon Jackson will talk about our second priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| today from the ESSER funds. We'll talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| And I assure you, they're more prepared than I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| I thought I could beat the rain today, and I lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| So, they are more prepared than I am. So, Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| All right. I don't think we've got an umbrella allocated for you in ESSER funds, so we'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| Good afternoon, guys. Thank you, Madam Chair and the Board, for giving us this opportunity to share this month's reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| of our ESSER implementation plan and monitoring plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| So, we'll jump right in and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| But first, I just want to recognize that part of our reporting out is to report out to a lot of the community stakeholders as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| So, just giving you an update since we last met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| We've met with the MCC, Knox County's Minority Community Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| We've met with Principal Advisory Council also, and we have an upcoming meeting with the Minority Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| as well as County Commission and the Teacher Advisory Council also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| which they've all provided very helpful discussion, very healthy discussion around our priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| and that's just an avenue for us to get some more dialogue and discussion on our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| So, just some great work that's happening already. Just wanted to report that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| And also, just pushing us back to our vision here, our ESSER vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| As you can tell, we have three major words that I love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| They're underlined in bolded, and to me that really is twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| It talks about, you know, how do we provide, use our ESSER dollars to provide equity and equality for all of our students across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| Not just one particular subgroup, one particular group of schools, or one particular school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| but all students across all schools and all student groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| So, that's what our focus is with these dollars and thinking about how we can be intentional with that through our priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| and how can we do that to accelerate the learning from the learning loss with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| Okay. The next slide here, I put this back up as well from last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| because it really talks about twofold what this work is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Really monitoring the implementation for the next 24 months, two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| and talking about how we can accelerate the work that we're doing and the strategies that we have in our ESSER plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| to make sure that we're meeting the learning loss of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| And also, twofold, the second part is how can we sustain any of the initiatives and all the priorities and strategies that we put in place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| So, just think about that as acceleration and also sustainability of the programming and the strategies that we'll put in place with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| Okay. Once again, here you got our four priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| You have priority one, which is foundational academic skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| which talks about the strengthening of our foundational skills, K-2 literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| which you'll hear more about tonight with Shannon Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Also, we have strengthening math skills, six through eight, which algebra one is an indicator as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| And then also we have priority two, effective educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| talking about how we can create a strategic approach to building a teacher and school leader capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| And then secondly in that is creating a plan for recruitment and retention of high-quality educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| And then our third priority, which is post-high school readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| We updated you guys about that one last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| And lastly, we have priority four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| which really talks about the interventions that we want to put in place to make sure we're supporting our students academically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| and also socially emotionally and also creating a safe and healthy learning environment for all of our students and staff across our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=509)|
| 0:08:41| Okay. So, right here is our board reporting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| Okay. So, as you can tell, we're on March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| So, today we'll be talking about foundational academic skills, which is priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| And Shannon Jackson is our priority owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| She's our executive director of teaching and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| So, she will give more in-depth knowledge of the updates with that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| And next month we have up is our overcoming obstacles to learning, which is priority four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| Okay. I want to put this in here just to push us back to the why around priority one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| So, if we think about, you know, the graph here, if you look at the left, I pulled up the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| And if you look on the left there, you have our third grade ELA TCAP trend data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| As you can tell, we've historically over the past five years been hovering around an average of 40% proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| But also you see that 2020 is missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| So, due to, you know, the events during 2020, we took a huge dip there to 34.7% of our students being proficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| So, that shows the urgent need for us to really push in with kindergarten through second grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| thinking about how we can really be strategic and have some strategies that we'll talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| and explain to you guys that we have in place to make sure that we're moving the needle to accelerate moving the needle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| and closing that gap there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Also, we understand that third grade is a key indicator to make sure students are ready to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| and are ready to learn by fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| So, we know that K through three, they're reading to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| And then also once they move to fourth grade, they're more hopefully ready to learn with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| And also to your right there, we have our KCS ninth grade algebra one trend data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| As you can tell there, we've been hovering historically over the past five years at 14% algebra one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| This does not include eighth grade honors algebra one, just to kind of give you that caveat as a reminder there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| But we took a pretty significant dip there in 2021 due to our, you know, experiences during 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=624)|
| 0:10:32| with only 7% being proficient there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| So, that shows the need for priority one, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| And I want to go a little deeper and dig a little deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| and just kind of show you some of the subgroup data as well that I pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| As you can tell here, there is a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Dr. Murphy, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| And it was talking about the algebra when you talk about we don't count the eighth graders in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| So, to me, that probably skews the data a little bit because just from my experience of having middle schoolers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| the eighth graders that take algebra are usually your higher performing kids in algebra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| So, we're kind of totally taking out your higher performers when we're looking at our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| I mean, why do we not include the eighth graders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| That is, I believe, a state reporting record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Gotcha, gotcha, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| And also, we're looking at that indicator because it is our lowest performing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| And so, that's why we're looking at that indicator with that understanding, like you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| that my daughter's in eighth grade algebra one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| So, like you're saying, they're honors students that are taking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| And so, we're looking at the lower performing to see where we need to move the needle with those lower performers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| But I do think sometimes with the public, it's good to sort of point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Kind of your higher performer math students are not even considered in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| And I totally think it's a concern and we've got to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| But I do think it's good, like when we're talking to the public and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| that they realize there's a whole set of kids that are not even being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Not even included, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Yes, and that's why I wanted to bring that caveat there, but I appreciate you bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Thank you so much for elevating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| And also, if you look at that, this right here is talking about the KCS third grade TCAP subgroup data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| Understanding just that there is still a gap, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| You know, you have another between the white students and other subgroups here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| I think Ms. Horn had a question too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| It was along the same lines because I'm curious, you know, really two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| I would like to see both numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| I would like to see because I think we need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| I'm curious just what the proficiency rate is specifically for eighth graders and then what it is combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| Because I feel like we're not looking at the whole picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| And same thing, we absolutely need to be focusing on that number, but we need to see the whole picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| So if we could add that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| We can absolutely add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Yes, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| And I totally agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| We can add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Just letting you guys know, this is the indicator for the ones where we're showing the need for us to push in with more support, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| But I can get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| And the next one, as I was mentioning here, just clearly shows a gap that exists that we need to really make sure we're intentional with providing supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| So that gap has not closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| So we have some work to do with accelerating the work with our strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| And you'll hear a lot more about what we have on deck with our priorities from Shannon as she comes forth here in a second with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| Also, just a quick, just showing you an overview, just like last time, of how we are intentionally monitoring the work that we're doing on a weekly basis with myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=807)|
| 0:13:36| This is what I live and sleep, so this is every day for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| But just making sure we're letting you guys know that we have a laser focus on how we're monitoring each of these strategies at the granular level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| But specific to today, this is a huge strategy, as you can tell here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| So this is how it's spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| We have Priority 1, foundational academic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| The priority owner is Ms. Shannon Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| And it's twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| You have K2, foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| And the priority lead is Ms. Janet Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| And then underneath that, you have Strategy 1, Strategy 1A, 1B, 1C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| 1A is instructional expectations, which is what you'll hear about coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Strategy 1B, PD opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| 1C is tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| And then over to your right, you have 6A, math and Algebra 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Mr. Gary Petko is our priority lead there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| And we have Strategy 2A, math tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| The tutoring aspect, again, instructional expectations regarding math, 2B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| And also the math talent pipeline in 2C, which is a strong need that we recognize also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| And I just wanted to let you guys know that we have 127 action steps for this priority alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| So that is a lot of work that our teams are doing a great job with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| But just to let you know the granular level, how we're looking at each of those action steps, 127 of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| and making sure that they're on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| If they're not on track, we're having discussions on how are we thinking collectively on how we can move the needle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| to remove any barriers that are causing them to not be on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| No lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| So in terms of success flow chart, this is how we're measuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| We have created an implementation goal and an outcome goal for each of our strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| which you will hear about here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| And the overarching goal is to make sure that we are keeping, like I say, a keen focus and a keen eye on moving the needle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| with each of the strategies and making sure that what we're doing is actually working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Are we meeting the deadlines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| And we're pushing back to every outcome goal is student-driven as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| So we're making sure we're targeting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| And the ultimate goal, obviously, is to have student success on grade level and post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| And, again, this is we reviewed this last ‑‑ I showed you guys this last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| But this is our status evaluation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| I made it a little clearer for you guys this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| If you look at the four, that's 80 percent of the current action steps are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| And also there's some criteria to the right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| And level three is 60 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| Level two is 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| And then level one is 20 percent on track as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| So this is our, you know, success criteria, if you will, for the work that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| This is kind of guys that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| And so you'll hear throughout the reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Up next you'll hear that we may be at a level four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| This is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| We may be at a level three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| This is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| And so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| And so next I'll hand it over to Ms. Shannon Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| And, once again, she's our executive director of teaching and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| So she has been doing a great job with her team, guiding the work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| And then she'll explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| And then I'll come back and give you the overarching report out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Thank you, Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I'm excited to talk to you about the work that we are doing to address our academic priorities within this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| We were able to bring to you a lot of the data that we collected during the needs assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| which was both student academic data but also a lot of teacher focus groups, principal focus groups, parent focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| and to really get an understanding of all the different tools we needed to bring to bear on these two initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| So the first one that we are going to talk about today is on instructional expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| As most of the state, we had a curriculum change this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| So our teachers are going through that curriculum shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| But we also are helping them very intentionally and strategically in a different way than we've helped with curriculum implementation before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| So for this case, we have really well-trained teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| They come to us at this point knowing how evidence-based reading, we've given them a good curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| and we are getting to assessing where our students are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| So this is about really helping us to look at what's working and what's not working as we're trying to work through the new curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| and understand where our teachers need a little additional help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| or where we need to help them think about making adjustments in the curriculum so that our students are reading on grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| So we talk in this one about the walkthrough tool that helps us to identify where we need to provide additional professional development support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1087)|
| 0:18:17| or additional resources for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| So it's helping us to see both cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| It's also geared towards providing help to families to be able to interpret the data that come to them with those home literacy reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| so that when they get a literacy report about their student, they know both what it means and there's a place for them to go for resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| So part of this is to build out a landing page on our website for families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| so that no matter where their student falls within that home literacy report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| there's a place for them to get some next steps or some resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| So our outcome goals here are that we will increase the effective use of the curriculum with integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| and we've been intentional about shifting our language here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| It used to be fidelity to the curriculum, and fidelity feels like I'm going to read the script.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| I'm just going to follow what's in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| We are talking more about integrity and understanding the evidence base behind the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| and then helping teachers to make good instructional decisions with the materials in order to meet the students they have in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| So if they're understanding how it's structured, then they can make changes and adjustments that make sense for their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| Making sure that our parents, again, are able to speak to their students' home literacy reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| and know where to go to get support and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| And all of this is to increase students' ability to read grade-level text by spring of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| So where we are with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| Right now we're at a level four, which four means we're on track with the action steps that we have started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| We developed a district literacy vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| We actually developed it as a literacy and numeracy vision because our K-2 teachers teach both numeracy and literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1194)|
| 0:20:02| so we did one vision for both, but called out specifically what are the actions that need to go into that vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| so that we can make sure we're aligning all of our resources, whether that's time, effort, energy, funds, to support that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1210)|
| 0:20:19| And then we've also been piloting a walk-through tool to see how that feels with teachers and school leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| and if we get the right information from it to be able to then provide support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| So meeting with our teachers, it started with a focus group with the two schools where we're piloting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| We're going back there tomorrow and the next day to get some feedback from them too on does this feel like support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| are we understanding what we're seeing so that we're bringing the right supports to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| Our key accomplishments here is that we have shared the literacy vision at teaching and learning days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| with all of our school-based instructional leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| We're piloting the walk-through tool at two sites and we're tailoring our support at those two sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| based on what we get from that walk-through information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| The next steps for this one are to share the vision district-wide and then to obtain some baseline data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| so that we can use that tool and see where are we across the district as we use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| and then to continue that feedback loop with our two pilot schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| Professional development opportunities is another strategy and this is where, you know, again, our teachers...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Yes. Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you, Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I'm not real familiar with the term walk-through, so can you say a little bit more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| in terms of how it functions and what the benefits are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| So a walk-through tool in this case is a tool that we use to go into a classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| and you just go in and spend about 15 minutes and watch the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| and see how are the students responding or not responding, how is time being spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| and then calibrating on that with the group that's going in and out of the classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| to make sure we're all seeing things the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| and then thinking through what are the next steps based on what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| So, you know, we can look at how time is spent, we can look at how students are answering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| and getting feedback, those kinds of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| So it's used mainly at a classroom level, not at individual student level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| It's used at the classroom level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| So 1B is focused on professional development opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| and this is where I do want to reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| I think we're very fortunate in our district that our teachers know the science of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| There was a law that passed last year and I think we were in front of you in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| talking about that we were already in compliance with that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| We've been focused on evidence-based reading for quite some time in this district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| and all of our teachers have been through a reading course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| and now we're partnered with the university and our teachers come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| with a good foundation in knowing the evidence-based behind teaching reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| And yet there are always opportunities to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| and there are some need for growing within this priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| One of them is making sure that all of our teachers are able to meet the new state compliance law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| for recertification if they teach in the K-5 classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| They have to be able to recertify through professional development opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| and pass a test on the science of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| So we have been working with the state department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| to craft our own professional development on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Our teachers can participate in the state's version if they want to, which is Reading 360,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| or they can go through what we're calling a micro-credentialing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| It's number three up here, the Job Embedded Professional Development Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| where they can choose multiple ways to learn that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| or if they already know it, then they can capture some evidence from their classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| and submit that for us to score and be able to sign off that they have indeed mastered that content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| and then they're eligible to take that assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| and to recertify for their license with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| We also are continuing to do foundational skills professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| There's always new research and new evidence out there of what is proving to be successful with children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| and so we continue to do that through our district learning days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| and through our teaching and learning days, through our literacy coaches and our department chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| But then adding into that, number two, is something I'm very excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| We have decided to invest in our teachers who are already in our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| and have each school, each elementary school, will have a literacy specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| So we've started our first cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| We started it on January 24th with 17 schools represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| and so they are going through a five course sequence with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| and at the end of that they will have their literacy specialist certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| So each school will have somebody in their building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| and we asked our administrators to work with identifying teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| who would remain in the school for three years to be able to share their expertise and their knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| and they're really focused on identifying reading difficulty, assessing reading difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| and then intervening on reading difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| So their job is going to be, they'll still be in the classroom but they will have this endorsement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| and they will have the knowledge to be able to guide their peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| in terms of getting into some of those more difficult cases to diagnose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| and diagnose in the informal term, not in the formal term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| Outcome goal here is to really increase our ability to provide targeted intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| based on what we're seeing in the progress monitoring data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| We already make sure that we're assigning interventions by deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| but the more specific we can get, the more effective that intervention will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| And again, our goal here is to increase our students' ability to read at grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| So where we are on this one, we're at level three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| So we have our first literacy specialist cohort launched on January 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| These funds were not approved until November and we were able to get 17 teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| who were able to apply to UT and go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| They've given us a lot of feedback on how we can help with that process moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| and UT has been a great partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| So we'll be helping people with that process as we launch cohorts two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| We have completed the reading, the reading department has completed the reading 360 course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| and has been partnering with the state to make sure that what we're putting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| for our professional development that is Knox County focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| aligns with the state's professional development as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| so that our teachers are well set up for that recertification assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| So our next steps are to identify literacy specialist cohort two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| and for our K2 teachers to be able to begin reading 360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| For our teachers who do the micro-credential through us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| if they complete that job embedded professional development and they do that one through us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| we are going to pay them a stipend of $1,000 to complete that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| So we're trying to make sure we're compensating them for that extra step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| of doing that learning and recertifying because it is quite extensive in the ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| Ms. Jackson, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| So is our goal to have one of these reading specialists in every single elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| That is our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| How quickly, I mean do we feel like in the second cohort we could get to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| or is it going to take several cohorts to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| We will run three cohorts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Our second cohort begins in the mini-term that is between the spring semester and the summer semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| and our third cohort begins in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| So the third cohort will really finish just six months behind the first cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| So really by mid-next year we should have every school having one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Ms. Jackson, another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| So I'm assuming we're paying for UT to do this for each teacher in the cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| And I think I heard you say this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| we're also compensating our teachers in addition to that, to their regular pay to go through it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| No, we're paying for the certification, it's not a degree, it's five courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| And then we are paying for those who complete the micro-credential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| So the job embedded professional development that everybody has to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| either reading 360 or our micro-credential to recertify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| we're paying those who do our micro-credential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| And the state has an opportunity this summer that they'll pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| if they choose to do the state's process instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| Okay, so then strategy three is focused on tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| Tutoring is a strategy that works very well with your economically disadvantaged students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| I think it's mostly effective because for those with the ability to get tutoring for their students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| they get the tutoring for their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| But economically disadvantaged students may not have either the means or the access to tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| We have some rural communities where there are not tutoring centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| and so they may not have access to tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| And so this is a strategy where we are looking at the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| who are not receiving formal intervention services but are in that below the 41st percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| So 41st percentile on one of our screeners means that they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| if they hit that 41st percentile, they're 70% likely to be proficient on our TCAP tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| So what we're looking at are identifying those students who are below that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| but not receiving other services and pairing them with a tutor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| In K-2, we're looking at 1 to 3 ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| We're hiring tutors for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| They can be full-time, they can be part-time, they can be time card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| And they work with the teacher, so the teacher gives them the materials from their own curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| And the tutor comes in and tutors them during some of their independent time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| So in elementary school, that could be during core extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Or it could be during small group, when their small group is not working with the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| So it's replacing some of that independent working time with another adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| who is focused on those skills that the students are lagging behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| It could also be used to accelerate students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| So if the tutor and the teacher agree that the students would be better off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| getting some foreshadowing of what's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| so then when they hear it with the whole group, they've already had some foundation in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| So this is what we're doing through Tennessee All-Core Tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| And so our goal here is that by spring of 2023, the percentage of students receiving tutoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1842)|
| 0:30:50| will significantly increase their ability to read at grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| So we're again focusing on those K-3 foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| Okay, so with this one, we're at level three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| We have created the vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| I actually, when I realized we were going to be doing this last semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| I hired Christine Pope to be our tutoring coordinator through our Title II-A funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| which gives us some sustainability in this initiative as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| This is a pretty big lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| So we've developed training modules for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| We've had partnering conversations with local universities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| They are shifting their practicum experiences next year so that they can be tutors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| and get their hours for their practicum experiences by showing up and tutoring our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| And many universities are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| They've been reaching out to us to make that offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| and we've been reaching out back to get those agreements in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| And then we also have shared the vision with four pilot schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| to organize and pilot the tutoring after spring break here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| And then all of the elementary schools have been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| with additional tutoring hours before or after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| So right now they have two different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| There's the all-core tutoring, which is the one-to-three ratio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| using the curriculum materials, partnering with the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| And then there's also the before and after school tutoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| that all elementary schools are offering to their families as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| So our next steps here are to partner with public affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| to develop a marketing plan for recruiting tutors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| recruit and train our newly hired tutors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| and to share the vision with the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| So I'm actually presenting this with our principal advisory committee this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| and we're looking at some different ways to partner with maybe some civic organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| and some different possibilities to recruit people in to be tutors for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| So middle school math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| You'll hear a lot of similarities with this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| but we have a couple of additional steps with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| Also working on math tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| So when you get into middle school, tutoring is effective with mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| It becomes less effective with reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| So we are really honing in here on those middle school math tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| We're looking to hire approximately 96, or the equivalent of 96,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| to tutor in grades 6 through 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Our implementation goal here is that by spring of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| we have the tutor training modules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| We've got teacher-to-tutor communication processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| So Christine Pope and Gary Petko, who is our strategy lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| have been out talking with department chairs and math teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| asking, what does this look like in a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| and how do we figure out that teacher-to-tutor communication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| And also talking about, you know, is this a helpful tool for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| And then we're looking at developing the quality of implementation metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| so that we know how to look at whether or not this is being successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| and where we need to adjust or change what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| By spring of 2023, our goal is to be operating with a minimum of 10% of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| in grades 6 through 8 receiving tutoring services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| That would mean that they are participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| at least two times a week for 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| And then, of course, what we're looking to see on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| is that our students score in the proficient performance categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| on benchmark assessments, and we'll see that number increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| as we refine our tutoring process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| So this one is at a level 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| We're mostly on track for where we anticipated being at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| Recruiting tutors is challenging in both initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| and I'll talk about that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| But it's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| It's in a similar place with the reading tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| We're also working on instructional expectations in middle grades math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| We ended up with a curriculum shift in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| with our middle grades math curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| very much focused on the Algebra I readiness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| and on the inquiry behind math learning that needs to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| in that 6 through 8 grade band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| So what we're looking to do here is to set up some demonstration classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| because what teachers are asking for is to be able to see it in implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| And we're not looking for perfection in the demonstration classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| We're looking for people who feel comfortable having folks come into their room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| and are able to articulate their decision making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| so that they can have those good conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| around how they are planning and implementing their curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| We want to start in grade 5 because there is a lot that happens in grade 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| that sometimes we want to reteach in grade 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| because they're not in the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| So letting them see that grade 5 to 6 and grade 8 to 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| is really important for them to have those cross-building conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| In this one we're also piloting a walk-through tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| which also helps us to know where to put our support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| and we're looking to increase our students' engagement in math inquiry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| And I have to say in some of the classrooms where I've gotten to see some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| it's very exciting to see students getting excited about talking about math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and really thinking about how they think about that inquiry with their math content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2174)|
| 0:36:23| So Gary Petko sitting over there, I'm sure he would love a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| to walk you through one of those inquiry experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| So spring 2023 we expect to see that alignment between the teaching standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| and the classroom instruction increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| as we use that walk-through tool as the measurement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| So here we're at level 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| They have the district vision created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| They've identified the walk-through tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| They've been meeting with department chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| I think they've met five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| And they're looking on that professional development plan for the demonstration teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| and then developing that communication plan for the district vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| so that everybody knows really clearly what the goals for proficiency in middle grades math is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| So their next step is to share that with the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| and to identify the next set of schools for the walk-through tool implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| Okay, so this one, 2C, will cover some of what I've talked about with the math tutors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| but also we're looking at math teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| So our goal here is to attract, recruit, and retain highly effective middle grade math and Algebra I teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| So math teachers are hard to come by in the secondary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| They're also hard to come by in the university for introductory math classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| And so we need to get creative in how we start finding people who have the passion and the talent to teach math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2261)|
| 0:37:50| and just don't realize that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| So we are looking to identify a cohort of mentor teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| And these are teachers who are veteran teachers who have been great math teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| and would be willing to take on an apprentice or somebody who is not yet certified in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| And then we'd like to identify some apprentice math teachers who could work with those mentors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| These are people who are not yet certified or people who are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| So one of the things I'm looking to do is to figure out how I work with public affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| and human resources essentially to build a bunch of math teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| so that we can, right now we can't make a hire if we don't have an open position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| And right now everybody's looking for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| So if we don't have an open position we'll lose math teachers to other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| but we know we'll have positions come open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| So this is a way for us to start getting creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| and we've had some initial meetings to think about what we can do in order to hire as many math teachers as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| even if we don't yet have positions for them because we know those positions will come available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| But also using our tutors, identify those who haven't finished their degrees yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| may not be thinking about being math teachers but fall in love with teaching math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| and convince them to work with us as a tutor and to get their math certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| their math teaching certificate and come be a math teacher for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| And we've put some funds in place to be able to support them through that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| so that hopefully we can get a really stable math teaching population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| So this is hopefully with those mentors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| The research behind mentorship is that a new teacher with a mentor accelerates his or her effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| within the first three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| A new teacher with a mentor can generate the same impact on kids as a fifth-year teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| if they have a good mentor who's helping and supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| So in this case, I wish we could do that for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| We don't have that amount of funding but math teachers, I think we're going to invest there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| We're also trying to increase the number of high-quality math candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| that are applying to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| This one's at a level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| And this one's at a level two because it is a recruitment strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| We're working to try to identify personnel who are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| A lot of people have left the workforce through the pandemic years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| but also we have a smaller population right now of people in the workforce than we used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| So we're having to really look carefully and get some good recruitment strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| on how do we find people to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| And so we're looking at tutoring in a position while you're in a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| paying tuition for a teaching degree while you're tutoring and getting job placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| hiring math teachers on an early contract above and beyond our identified vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| and attaching new teachers to experienced mentors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| Looking at this mentoring program where we can hopefully retain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| Teachers who are mentored also have a higher level of satisfaction with their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| And so we're working through that process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| And then also growing your own pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| So continuing to look at those creative paths for getting people through licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| In this case, we are working, like I said, with human resources, with public affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| to look at some new strategies for how we might attract and retain talent in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| So some marketing campaigns, some collateral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| We've talked about possibly getting in front of as many different civic organizations as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| to see if they have some idea of how to help us to recruit tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| And then through that recruitment, identifying people who maybe want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| and do really meaningful work teaching middle grades math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| Okay, so I think this is where I turn it back over to Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Yes, Ms. Saxon. One question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I've heard the, we've been hearing the phrase grow your own in a lot of different contexts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| within Knox County schools and education as a whole recently, even at a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| I mean, the idea of grow your own seems like a pretty long runway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Can you speak some to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| So I can speak a little bit to grow your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Human resources can probably speak more to grow your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| But yes, we do see that as a long-term strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| So when we talked about the 12 to 24 months and the 3 to 5 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| grow your own, we see the benefit of that in 3 to 5 years in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| That's where we're looking at some of those shorter-term strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| If we can identify some people who are, they have a college degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| but they want to come in and tutor for us, turns out they love math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| We've got a partnership with a graduate school that will allow them to tutor for us full-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| receive a salary, and then go through the graduate school program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| and be ready to teach in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| So we're looking at a balance of, and then also just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| I'm trying to think of some different ways to recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| So we're trying to think of a balance of immediate recruitment strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| and then also those longer-term strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| Yeah, well, I appreciate the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| And the reality is even if you have a long runway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| you'll never get to the end unless you start, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| And so I appreciate the focus and the energy on looking at some of those longer-term strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| and not just getting sucked into the urgent, but also looking at the longer-term gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| All right, thank you so much, Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| And also, like you said, I appreciate it, too, because it talks about, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| going back to how do we not put a bandage on, but how do we meet the immediate needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| but also think about sustainability also with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| So I appreciate that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| I know our math supervisor is here, Gary Petko,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| and he ran the numbers for you guys on the eighth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| So if you guys want to hear those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| So we're trying to be proactive here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| So you want to come up, Gary, and talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I didn't mean to call you out, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| Thank you, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Yes, and I want to introduce Janet Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Janet, can you stand up and raise your hand also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| She's key to our team also, so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Did you have to do math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Really, did you sit over there and do the math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Oh, that was my next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| I was going to say, Madam Chair, we can also do some math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| Ms. Jackson talked about discovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Really, it's some exciting stuff going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| The whole concept of we used to just give, for example, give a formula or give a rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| and then give examples to it, and now we're trying to go the opposite direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| and let the kids discover the concept and discover the rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| and then with real-life examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| and then let them come up with the formula themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| It's really kind of exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| So I welcome you into the classes if you want to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| What we've got for the last year for our eighth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| we had about 24% of our eighth graders take an eligible one across the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| and that varied from school to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Some had more and some had less, anywhere from maybe 40 to down to 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| Out of those that took the eligible one in the eighth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| about 61% were on track or masters for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| But since that's a smaller percentage when you consider all the eligible one-takers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| that drew the average down, skewed it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| So that's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Gary, do you know, you just mentioned it's a fairly small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| Do you have any sense of what the percentage is of total eighth graders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| versus total number of eligible students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| The number of eighth graders, we had 1,032 eighth graders take eligible one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| out of the 4,000 eighth graders in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| So if you throw that in, probably about 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Normally we have about 4,000 ninth graders in high schools take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| so probably about, again, 20% of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| About a fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Still, 61% is not what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| We want higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| But we're going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| My seat is at the wrong height and I keep hitting the button, so sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| Okay, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| I spoke with one of our great eighth grade algebra teachers who I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| like every kid in his class, is proficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| And one of the issues that he brought up was kids knowing multiplication facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| and obviously they learned that, what, in third grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| Yes, they start in third grade, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| So, you know, by the time they get to eighth, ninth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| if they haven't been reviewing those constantly, they get to eighth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| or they get to ninth grade algebra and they, you know, have to reteach or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| So are changes being made to increase the repetition throughout the grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| so that that doesn't need to be retaught when they get to algebra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| I think it, yes, the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| We're trying to reintroduce it throughout the whole third grade through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| I think we ran into, if I ask anyone, if I'm in a social setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| they ask what you do and I tell them I'm a teacher, they all want to talk about math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Or they want to talk about teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| When I say I was a math teacher, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| the two things that come out of people's mouths is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| well, I'm not a math person or I hated math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| And then the next question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| why can't we just memorize multiplication tables like we used to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| And I want to say, well, if you didn't like math, you weren't good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| How did that memorization work out for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Because memorization is kind of a chore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| And there is a need for rote automaticity after a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| But I think we went through a phase where early on when third grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| fourth grade is when students gain their most powerful impression about mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| And that's when we're having them doing straight memorization first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| I think about the old Barney Fife show on Andy Griffith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| We tried to memorize the preamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| I can memorize the preamble, but that doesn't mean I know anything about democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| But if I understand the concept of democracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| then I have a better chance of putting it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| So the changes that are being made over the past years is having kids visualize the mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| What is 8 times 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Rather than memorize 8 times 6 at first is 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Can we understand that 8 times 6 is 8 groups of 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| And see an area model, see it, visualize what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| so then we get to contextual problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Now it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| By doing that and then continuing to review that over the course of the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| and I think with this new middle school curriculum we're doing, it's really doing that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| I think it will help when we get to the Algebra I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| I do think, again, I don't want to say that we shouldn't memorize multiplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| That's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| That shouldn't be our default way to start doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| I think we've done that in the past, and that has led to less retention over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| So are you saying that they're not expected to memorize multiplication facts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| I'm saying that's not their initial way to learn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| So I understand they, and it makes sense if they understand the concept behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| So they are then required to memorize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Because to me you have to, like you understand the concept, but you have to memorize it at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| Otherwise when you get to Algebra you're trying to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| it takes you five minutes to figure out the multiplication before you can get to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| Yes, absolutely it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| That's a road to get to memorization, but not straight starting with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| I think that's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| And so when do they actually memorize those now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Is it third grade, fourth grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| By the end of third grade they're supposed to be fluent in their multiplication 0 through 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| And when I think of fluent, I think of the word fluid in there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| So I think of water being fluid doesn't have to move fast to move, to be fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| It just has to move, and if it hits an obstacle it knows how to get around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| That's what water being fluid is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| So in third grade when we say they have to be fluent in mathematics, it's not quick recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| It's just can they understand what 8 times 9 is and get the answer, maybe not quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| And then by the time fourth and fifth grade finishes up, that's when we should have rote automaticity by that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| So one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| So when we get to TCAP for third grade math, are they, I'm assuming that it reflects that so that they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3011)|
| 0:50:20| when they're taking a timed test, they're not being, it's not going to reflect negatively on them because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3020)|
| 0:50:28| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| And I think that's why we're giving, we're teaching them the skills so that if they don't get it quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| they have a way to get that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| And it's not, I guess the way I look at, like my son, if I ask him what 5 times 7 is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| he's going to tell me very first, when he first learned multiplication, he's going to think to himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| well, I know that 5 times 5 is 25, and I know that, what can I do from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| 5 times 7 is, 2 times 7 is 14, and I can add those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| So he's starting to find different ways to get that answer, and I think that's helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| So when they do have TCAP and it is timed, if they don't get it quickly, they've got another way to get around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| So bottom line is they are, by coming at it from the conceptual direction first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| I think it helps with the memorization, and it doesn't hurt them on the TCAP by the end of third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| Fourth to fifth grade, we want them to try to have more rote automaticity and memorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| And we are trying to review that in the middle school's grades as well, because it builds up their self-efficacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| Anybody that can do their multiplication quickly, you know, they feel better about themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Can I have one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| And I think this kind of pairs a little bit with what she's asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| and I know you've struggled with me since my kids were in middle school on math, and I was a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| I've been calling Mr. Petko about math for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| but it kind of goes along with probably what I was dealing with back when my kids were in middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| is I think a lot of this is such a different way than we learned math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| I mean, I had my flashcards, and I learned it, and I still don't know my sevens and my eights timetables very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| But that was kind of the way we learned it, and it sounds like there's new concepts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| but I think what I hear struggled a lot of times, and I'll see people posting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| is the parents are just like, why are they doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| And so I do have that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Are we trying to educate parents at all to help them understand why we're changing the way we're doing math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| And when you explain it to me, I can understand it, but I still see these parents who struggle of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| why are we just not teaching, you know, why are we just not doing the flashcards and sitting down and memorizing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| So I do think there's some parent education that can help, and I don't know how well we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| And so that's a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| What we're attempting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| There's a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Every one of our math lessons in elementary school have a parent page that can go home with their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| We have on the Aspen page, you can actually find the math Aspen page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| and it has every one of those same letters already on there in a PDF form that a parent can access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| That goes for when we're learning multiplication or we're learning division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| it says this is what the student's going to learn this week, and it has a step-by-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| In addition, on that Aspen page, along with on our math website page, we have a math YouTube channel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| that we have close to 216 videos produced by our coaches and our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| and they're anywhere from four to ten minutes long, and it's broken down by grade and by topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| So if you're not sure how to do multiplication by the area model, you can look at that video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| Now, just having those out there is not the final solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| We've got to continue to get that message out that they are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| That's a challenge, but we'll continue to send that message anytime we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| We have parent meetings. We're getting our teachers to get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| If a parent calls and asks, how can I help, we can direct them to the math YouTube channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| We can direct them to the Aspen pages, the math Aspen page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| We also have ways to help your child with math homework on that math Aspen page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| and all the parents do is just access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| So getting that message out is just continuing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| I don't know if we've talked about the department chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| At one of the previous meetings, as we start building in elementary department chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| that's one of their tasks is continue to make sure our teachers are all aware of the math resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| that are out there for their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| And that YouTube channel is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| So it sounds like we've got some good resources out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| Sometimes it's just communicating out to people that it's there and that type of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Okay, well, that's good to know. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| Thank you so much, Mr. Petko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| So hopefully that kind of provides some more clarity around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| And like you say, this is a team, so it's a team effort with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| So we meet weekly and kind of dialogue around these things, so that helps us out at all as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| So I wanted to touch base right here, just letting you guys know overall where we are with this priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| We're at Level 3, specifically looking at the data that I pulled, the strategies that are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| We're at 83%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Five out of the six are on track, and like Ms. Jackson mentioned, Strategy 2C is at Level 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| just based on the breadth of the work that we have to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| We'll find those tutors and recruitment and retention of those tutors in that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| Also, the action steps that are completed are 32%, meaning that's 24 out of the 75 action steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| that have been started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| So also the action steps that are on track, 65%, 49 out of 75, action steps with minor delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| and that's also, again, in 2C, there are two with minor delays there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| And overall, the action steps not started, and that's based on timelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| because a lot of the work is forecasted out this summer with professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| things of that nature that just hadn't started yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| And so those are 52 out of 127, which is 41%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| And also we kept these three barriers in here from last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| because these are things that, you know, obviously you can tell that we want to elevate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| and make sure we keep our eyes on this, just managing the change on a critical timeline that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| and also planning ahead with procurement and hiring and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| and also the staffing challenges that Shannon Jackson has alluded to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| Did you want to speak more into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| So the two strategies dealing with finding the tutors and also with the math teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| the staffing challenges, it's finding the personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| so getting creative in ways that we can tap into people who we don't normally access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| because right now the way to find a job posting for us is to go to our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| You have to be looking for a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| So how do we pull people to us who haven't thought that working in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| might be a great, meaningful job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| For anybody who's listening, it is the most meaningful work you will do, so come to our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| And then also just planning ahead for procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Because these are all purchased with federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| there is a higher bar for getting through the procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| and so we are being very intentional about planning that out and working with procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| to make sure that everything that we do put out for bid is available to be purchased with federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3430)|
| 0:57:21| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Any questions from this slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| Practicing my wait time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| That was two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| So the next slide, just always finishing with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| understanding that we're talking about acceleration, yes, but also sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| Because we don't want to just focus on accelerating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| spending the allocated ESSER dollars and then just dropping the ball with sustainability for our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| because we want to make sure we look at the bigger picture of this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| So our next board share-out will be next month with priority four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| overcoming obstacles with Mr. Jason Myers to learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| So we're looking forward to that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| So just giving you an understanding of how it works is this past February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| myself and Shannon's team prepped and planned for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| So in March we'll be planning with Jason and his team for April share-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| So we meet weekly with all the strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| but we kind of put a laser focus on the strategy where we're really honing in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| And I like our model because it really, A, it helps me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| and I'm just going to give a testimonial just being out the principal seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| freshly out of the principal seat, I guess, six or eight months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| When I'm looking at the strategies and looking at the work, it's promising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| and I'm beginning to visualize how it's going to look at the school site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| I'm beginning to visualize my former students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| So it's good stuff that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| So we just have to make sure we're keeping our eye on it and keeping a laser focus on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| So any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| It doesn't look like it, so thank you, Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Yes, Mr. Chan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| I'd just like to say that from what you all have talked about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| it sounds like you all are doing fantastic work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| and I'm really appreciative of all the hard work that everyone has put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| because I do feel like this will really, really help students moving forward in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| not just recovering from what the pandemic has caused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| but also improving those proficiency levels into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| So, again, thank you for all the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Yes, and thank you so much for that compliment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| because I do believe that with our outcome goals and our implementation goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| we develop those with our REA department, being really strategic with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| and making sure that it's driven by student data also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| So we are looking at that, and like I said, I'm living and breathing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| so I have that pulled up on my computer every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| This is what I'm living, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| I just want to say that I appreciate the intentional shift from fidelity to integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| I think that is a very important way of looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| and I think our teachers will very much appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Integrative implementation, I think, is what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| So that really focuses on sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| and it pushes back to, you know, are we doing the right work for our students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| This is what this is all about, which is what we're very passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| So thank you guys so much, and I will get out of your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Thank you, Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Mr. Petko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3619)|
| 1:00:31| Okay, so moving into the discussion on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| Under 8C, Item 1 or 2, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| I have a question on the Department of Education-Tennessee School Climate Survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| If somebody could speak to that and whether that's a replacement for what Steve Rutter usually does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| for school climate and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| Is that Dr. Cox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| I'll be sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| I didn't want to jump the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| So I will say Ms. Cook is here, so she can answer maybe more in depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| but basically this is for students who have gone through the state trauma-informed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| This was a requirement for them to do that for this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| So we had seven schools that previously had been done that we've approved this for in past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| and so we have three additional schools that need to take that survey now in order to get the state certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| Okay, so it's only that small segment of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| So item three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| Items five or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| Seven or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| Nine or ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| Okay, moving to board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| Items A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| Item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| Under grants, item A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| First, I just appreciate Knox Ed Foundation and their continued support of what we're doing through Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| and notice that in the funding, there's actually money allocated for all of our schools across the district at different amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| Can somebody speak just a little bit to some of the different types of things schools might be using some of these funds for from Knox Ed Foundation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3764)|
| 1:02:53| Is that you, Dr. Raswood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| It is. Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| So the way that READS, so those haven't been turned in yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| I'll give you breakdowns on how the funds are distributed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| but funds will be awarded to promote school-wide or targeted student support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| high-quality professional development for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| making sure they have what they need to support student learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| So that was sent out to the schools as kind of the parameters for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| and so they're sending in individual school requests for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| So the way those dollars are allocated, if you are a current community school, that those schools get $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| If you are one of the seven high schools involved in the Ford NGL work that we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| then they're getting $2,500, and then all other schools are getting $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| So within those parameters to support the teachers and or the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| So any other questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| Item C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| Or item D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| So contracts 11, any questions on item A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Yes, could somebody just talk about the mass notification system and what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| and how it compares to whatever we're doing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Ms. Harrington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| So our contract with our mass notification provider expires at the end of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| so we initiated a bid process, and ParentSquare was selected from a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3873)|
| 1:04:42| And so ParentSquare is very similar to what we're using now in the sense that it's a mass notification system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3882)|
| 1:04:52| but it's different in a lot of other ways because it will provide two-way communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| through not just mass notification but classroom communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| so teachers could communicate with students and parents through this platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| There's also a language integration platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| and there is also some other features that we'll be getting through this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3916)|
| 1:05:26| such as a mobile app and an opportunity for forms to be digitized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| So we're real excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| And have you talked to any high school teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| I mean, I know when mine were in high school that a big thing was like group me's that the teachers had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| and I didn't know if they had been talked about this, if they thought it would be a good addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| We did have some administrators on our committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| but that's probably going to be a discussion that we're going to have to have in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| because it's not just high school, it's across all of our schools in terms of some of our schools use Remind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3957)|
| 1:06:05| some of them use ClassDojo, so those are some conversations that we're going to have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Will there be any consolidation of other services that we use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| I know our other contract is running out, but I remember the board last year, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| approved another service that had some language translation capability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| and I know this new software does as well, so is there any consolidation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| So right now, it's not through the district, but it's through Knox Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| They have a pilot program through our 16 community schools with talking points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| and so with this new contract, we're going to not use talking points for this school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| but we'll take a look at how ParentSquare is working with those communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| and if we need to reevaluate that, Knox Ed Foundation has been very open to having those conversations again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| So have we already implemented talking points, and now we might be retracting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| Talking points was implemented this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| There are some ELL teachers that have been using it even before this school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| but yes, it was implemented for this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| And the new software would not go into effect until this coming school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| It would go into effect July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| So moving to regular agenda items, 12A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4056)|
| 1:07:44| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| I dug into the balance designation in letter B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| and I noticed there was funds in there for some data aggregation software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| and I know Chief has talked about that several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| I'm assuming this is something different than for CAS V,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| and I know the initial implementation is around $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| Do we know the ongoing costs for that software?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| What we're looking at would be about $30,000 a year ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| for our dispatch and report management system is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| Can you speak to some of the types of data that we'll be able to aggregate using this platform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4109)|
| 1:08:38| Sorry, Russ, I didn't prepare you for these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| No, I can't, as a matter of fact, because all of my security experts are somewhere else right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4121)|
| 1:08:50| But we have the foresight to ask them to provide me some bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| So what we're looking at is it's a computer-assisted dispatch system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| It will help manage our dispatch records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| It will help manage text-to-tip and community reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| all integrated into a central system where it comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| and will link the reports to dispatch and will help us maintain those reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| and go back and pull them up electronically so that we have a long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| and a quick, easy way to capture our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| It also integrates cellular devices and speech-to-text within the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4174)|
| 1:09:47| It will also support and execute the management of simultaneous events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| We have talked about data aggregation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| but this is more of a dispatch management and an information management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4199)|
| 1:10:08| for our calls that we work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| It is not necessarily the system that we will need to reach out and pull information in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4211)|
| 1:10:20| to help us make broad assessments of what our security posture needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| or what the security threat needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| This system will help us with some of that, but it is not the end state for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| There are other systems that we need to look at over time to bring in to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| So this is more of a replacement system with additional functionality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| And then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Well, right now, our system is what I would call analog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| It is guys with spreadsheets and logbooks maintaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| This will help us get away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| And then my last question is, I think I read this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| this is also asking for 20 additional SSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| We are asking for 20 additional SSOs in the upcoming budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| What we have found this year, particularly with COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| is that we have struggled on days when we have high absentee to get our bases covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| We've also found that over time, particularly when we do things like random searches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| or we need to plus up our presence in some areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| we have to pull down in other areas, and we don't really want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| We want to build in a little bit of flexibility in the force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| So we have asked, we will be asking for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| or we've asked for that in the current draft of the FY23 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| That, of course, has not been approved yet, but should it be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| we will need to put those individuals in academy classes this summer and this fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| and we'll need to have the equipment on hand to provide to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| So this will allow us to plus up our equipment reserves, like in firearms and radios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| and vests and badges and all that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| so that we'll have what they need to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| So the additional SSOs are primarily, from what I understand you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| to handle our existing coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| It's not necessarily new designated deployments at different schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| Well, there will be new designated deployments at different schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| but what it will do is it will give us more depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| so that on a daily basis when we move people around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| we're not having to pull down our staffing at certain schools too greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4364)|
| 1:12:53| or to lean more heavily on law enforcement as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| who has the same challenge we do on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| keeping their folks in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| So my last question then is if there's designated deployments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| do you have a sense already in terms of are these additional deployments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| within elementary schools, middle schools, high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| Do we have a sense of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| It will depend, and that goes back to we want to have the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| to when we do our analysis of what the threat is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| that we have the flexibility to change our posture and reassign people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| in order to make sure that we have the right people in the right place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| to address any threat that we've designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| So what it will do is it will allow us to flow people from one post to another post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| without pulling them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| So you'll basically have two categories of officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| You'll have officers that are assigned to a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| and then you'll have officers that will be temporarily assigned to places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| based on what the threat may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Thank you, Mr. Rhodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| So any more questions on those two items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| So item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| And item D, and before we discuss item D, just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| I think Gary is going to give us an update on the current situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| since there were some developments today, but also before you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| I would just like to say that when we moved to this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4472)|
| 1:14:41| that this resolution was not presented to county commission by board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| That's a false assumption out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| that this resolution was written by Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| and presented to county commissioners by Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4494)|
| 1:15:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| So, yes, you've requested a status update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| I'm happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| There's been quite a bit going on in the mask mandate case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| MB et al. versus Governor Lee et al. since the board's last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| But I will talk about the legal end of it, starting with last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4519)|
| 1:15:28| So a week ago, we received a motion from the plaintiffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| to modify the mandate to what the new CDC guidelines are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4535)|
| 1:15:43| which had come out a short time before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| After that, we had been working hard, have been working hard throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| but we're working even harder to comply with this board's request to file our own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4551)|
| 1:15:59| what you called a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| It's actually legally called a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| And so we've been working on that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| and we had to then respond to what the plaintiffs filed on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| So that's been done at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| We, on behalf of the board, are asking for, obviously, the mandate to end, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| No, not tied to the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| So then some other things went on last week, reported in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| Our office has always maintained that we welcome parent assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4594)|
| 1:16:41| particularly through things like amicus curiae briefs and that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| Well, that has finally come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| What we've seen in the past week is that a new case has been filed involving the same parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| but new plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| That's the unmasked Knox County kids case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| That was first introduced by Mayor Jacobs and Representative Zachary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| We've also seen, as of last Friday, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| some parents intervened in the existing case through local attorney Andy Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| So obviously things have been occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| And then today, this morning, late, late morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| we received a motion from Judge, I'm sorry, an order from Judge Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4647)|
| 1:17:36| It's fairly short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Ordering that the parties in our case that I've been discussing go to mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4659)|
| 1:17:46| And that's the federal mediation process is what he ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| And that's to occur within 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| However, there was some confusion around some language in that order about a stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| And I believe media outlets have already reported on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| stating that, I mean, it did not stay the actual injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| And frankly, I mean, it can be read more than one way, but it talks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4691)|
| 1:18:18| I mean, with the order talking about going to mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| we felt like our office felt like we needed to, well, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| matter of fact the federal rules required that we ask for clarification from the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| So that's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| I mean, so we've already asked for clarification from the judge on that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| And lastly, another thing that's developed today and, well, I mean, let me say this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4720)|
| 1:18:50| This board had designees to negotiate this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| That has been ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| And Chair Christie and Jason Myers have been involved in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| We've also been talking to plaintiff's attorneys about a proposal to unmask during negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4746)|
| 1:19:20| during mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| So I can probably talk a little bit more about that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| in case the board wants to go ahead and have a resolution on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| Do you want to talk more about that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| Yeah, I think a resolution or anything we can do to get masks off kids quickly I think we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4777)|
| 1:19:46| So I don't want to misspeak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| So let me refer to the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4788)|
| 1:19:55| And, again, it's just a proposal, but it's something we could be working on with the board's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4795)|
| 1:20:04| I had it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4809)|
| 1:20:33| I think I just found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Okay, so the proposal we're working on, I mean, obviously the board disagrees with the plaintiffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4837)|
| 1:20:45| as far as the reasoning to take off masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| So the plaintiffs have made it clear that they are requesting the court adopt the CDC guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4848)|
| 1:20:57| the new CDC guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Our counter is that we don't agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| that state law wouldn't allow us to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| And so what the proposal would be from both the plaintiffs and the board would be to the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4868)|
| 1:21:16| I mean, assuming the judge were to agree with it, that while, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| the parties do not agree as to why the lifting of the mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4881)|
| 1:21:28| that we would agree to lift the mask mandate while mediation is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4888)|
| 1:21:35| So that's the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| Yes, I want some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| So I know the plaintiffs put forth to the judge about following CDC guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| We put forth some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| The judge is basically, from my understanding of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| not coming back on either of those and telling the two parties to mediate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| And if the judge tells us to mediate it, is it required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Which we could have started a while ago, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| I mean, not for y'all, but, I mean, this board had not wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| I mean, so we're thinking we're going to be mandated to mediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| This board is mandated to mediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| It doesn't mean that you have to settle the case through mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| but you are now mandated to mediate the case through the federal mediation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| So what that means is it has to be a federally approved mediator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| It can't just be, you know, just any old mediator, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| And this could be a long, drawn-out process for mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| or could it handle pretty quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| Because, I mean, I'm hearing from everyone, and I think we all as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| basically as a community, we are not under CDC guidelines any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| Basically, Knox County Schools is the only people wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| not right now in Knox County, out of mandate, not out of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| I know there are people who are choosing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| So following the mediation, which we're going to have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| if we don't get something else to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| how quickly do we feel like this could proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| Just from your experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| I know you don't have a definitive answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| The judge has ordered mediation to occur within 60 days, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| So it has to be done in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| I guess my concern is 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| we're getting close to the end of school by that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| Does that mean to complete within 60 days or to start within 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| To complete the mediation within 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| And I'm assuming if mediation, when mediation begins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| that would also make any negotiations that we're doing moot, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| You would not do both at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| Well, we're currently negotiating with the plaintiffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| and my assumption would be if we're entering into formal mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| that would probably cease negotiation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| It would seem to be moot to do the two things at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| or am I not correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| It's all part of the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| I mean, since we're already negotiating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| I mean we have to take that into account when we go into mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| One thing that this board needs to consider for Wednesday is do you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| continue with the same designees for mediation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| And frankly, I think the plaintiffs have expressed a preference for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| because otherwise, you know, mediation ceases to look like what we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| normally see as mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| It would then be a public meeting similar to what we're sitting in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| So I spoke to Mr. Sanders before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| and he was saying there's something in the rules that seems like it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| limiting to us because you have to mediate in good faith and have people who can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| actually make the decision in the mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| but this board can't make a decision outside of the whole groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| So what's the – I know you all met after he and I spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| so what's the – can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| I mean, this board has to mediate in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| so that is required by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| And if you are giving authority to your designees to mediate in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| then that's – we feel that that, you know, satisfies the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| I mean, again, the only other alternative to designees is going to be a public mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| which would not look like anything like a traditional mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| And so the board would need to take action to approve those designees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| and you're suggesting that we approve the same designees that we've been using for negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| I'm saying you need to approve designees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| and, I mean, you have designees that have been negotiating in good faith already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| And then the proposal that you mentioned, who generated that proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| I didn't hear that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| That was – that's been – it was proposed to be a joint, you know, proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| so it's been discussed on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| That's what I was asking, if one side or the other put it forth and the other hasn't spoken to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| or if it's something that's been being worked on together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| Yeah, that's a joint proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| And then my final question is for Chair Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| I appreciate your clarification that Mr. Beeler wrote the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| but I'm assuming that a board member or board members prompted him to submit a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| or did he do that completely on his own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| From watching the commission meeting, he seemed to indicate that he was approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| He was, by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| I asked him because that was not an option at our previous board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| and as I have said many times, it would still have to come back to the board for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| and it was nothing more than to give us something else to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| And since we spoke at that county commission meeting, just keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| we have had how many other motions filed and lawsuits filed against us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| Obviously, it was building up to that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| But it was just to give us another option or avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| And he knew that and I knew that, and it was just if we had the consent to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| we could bring it back to the board and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| No guarantee it would even pass, but just another option or path forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| because we don't have a lot of paths, avenues right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| So that was my intent in approaching him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Approached him in my individual capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| And, you know, I think Ms. Coney can send you the communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| It was not sent on board chair letterhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| It was sent as the ninth district, so that's how that came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| I think we have a point of order issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| I think this is getting into the hearing issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| and probably shouldn't be discussed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| We're discussing the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5297)|
| 1:28:28| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| I just have a question back to the joint proposal that Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| So basically that has been worked on, but has it been submitted to the court yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| You may have said that and I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| No, thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| No, so you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| You know, this board would have to approve that proposal first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| So there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| And then obviously the plaintiffs would then have to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| And then the next question would be if, let's say we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| what would the time frame be on an answer back from the judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| And I'm assuming he would have to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5363)|
| 1:29:31| Say that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| So if we do approve that and if it goes to Judge Greer, would he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| I mean would the expectation be that he would give us a ruling on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| So we can't guarantee what Judge Greer will do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| but the thought is if it's a joint proposal, both sides are agreeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| that he would hopefully rule on that fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5400)|
| 1:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| I guess what I'm asking and I want clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| because I know my big thing is I want these kids out of Mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| And I feel like what we're trying to ask for that would match what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| board voted for as a majority back in the fall is we don't want anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| tied to the CDC, even though right now the CDC would let us get out of Mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| And it seems like the plaintiffs have put forward about tying it to the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| but we keep being told by our lawyers that we can't do that because it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| But I have had some people tell me that this statute is subject to an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| injunction by a Middle Tennessee case, and so it's basically stayed right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| that we do have the ability to ask to follow the CDC guidelines for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| which, if they would agree to it, would, while we're trying to mediate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| move us forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| But you're thinking we can't do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| I mean, I keep hearing from you all that we cannot follow the CDC guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| because that's going against state, but then I hear that there's a stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| through the Middleton C case that allows us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| Because I would just like to see us move forward as quickly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| while we're trying to mediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| Can I say something, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| I've been told the same thing by several other attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| the exact same thing you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| But I'm not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| So, yeah, different attorneys have different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| I know that someone reached out to the plaintiff's attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| and they have different opinions than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| Big shocker there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| But, you know, so there's a state law that only allows mass mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| in very limited situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| And there is a federal court in Middle Tennessee that's issued a preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| injunction against that state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| So if you agree to the CDC guidelines based upon that preliminary injunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| and then that preliminary injunction goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| then you are now in violation of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| So that's why, you know, our office has been consistent in saying that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| agree to the CDC guidelines, you will eventually be in violation of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| Maybe not right this instant, okay, because there is that federal court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| But, I mean, you're running that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| And here, again, we're saying that plaintiffs are willing to a joint proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5558)|
| 1:32:47| to, regardless of the reason, take away the mass mandate while we're negotiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| and mediating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| They are willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Or we're proposing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| That's what I've been talking about is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| we're talking about a joint proposal to the court to take, regardless of the reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| because we disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| We disagree with the plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| But regardless of the reason, take away the mass mandate while we're mediating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| Okay, that's where I was confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| So they're agreeing with us to both put forward that proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| It would be a joint proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| I was thinking it was just from us, so thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| Well, this may not be relevant right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| but I would just like to remind this board that the CDC is not a lawmaking body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| It's a regulatory body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| And if we agree to the CDC, as the plaintiffs have suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5622)|
| 1:33:50| that that could become a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| and we would have to follow CDC guidelines wherever it might lead us next fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| with their numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| So I would just caution the board against doing anything that would concede to the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5640)|
| 1:34:08| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Mr. Dupler, if I may, I'd like to say this in a different way that maybe you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5652)|
| 1:34:20| So if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| what you're telling us is that the most expedient thing we can likely do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5662)|
| 1:34:29| that does not involve the CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| and does not involve the potentiality of a stay for some other part of the county being overturned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5671)|
| 1:34:39| would be to accept a joint proposal with the plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5679)|
| 1:34:49| Yes, I think that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| And to be clear, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| I didn't hear in the proposal that it's based on CDC guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| The joint proposal, it's based on the duration of mediation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| Because right now the CDC guidance, because we're medium, it's off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| but let's say next week it went high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| if we agree, the judge agreed we're in mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| it's not based on the CDC guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| It's based on the time frame of mediation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| That's the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| Up to 60 days, because that's what's been mandated, 60 days for mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| And based on the guidance you've been consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| and the law department has been consistent with around the case in Middle Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| you've obviously been a part of, or the law department's been a part of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| Are you saying as the law department that you don't feel like this proposal will get us into issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| because it's not based on CDC guidance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| Because it seems like the law, if the stay is removed, would still impact it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| I mean, that's the reason for the joint proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| is that both sides recognize there's a disagreement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| But for the time frame of the mediation, we can agree to take off the mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| And also notice that Director Buch is in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| and we're speaking specifically about this Resolution D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| I don't know, Director Buch, if you want to speak to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5776)|
| 1:36:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5784)|
| 1:36:41| David Buch, Knox County Law Director, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Number one, the resolution that went before commission was drafted by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| Richie Beeler did not even see it, nor did I, until five minutes before that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| So that's just a clarification that the mayor is the one that drafted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| I have no idea what went on and who talked to the mayor or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| With regard to this, I think I had said that if the school board wanted to hire its own expert or lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5831)|
| 1:37:19| or whatever to give advice, I'm not dead to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| I said publicly I'd welcome anybody's advice who wants to give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| So if that's what you want to do and it's limited to giving advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| because we're handling the lawsuit as we're required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| whatever this board wants to do, it's out of your pocketbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| And the way I read the thing from commission, we'll recommend to you a lawyer that has ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5865)|
| 1:37:52| ADA education experience, not just any lawyer, but an ADA-experienced lawyer, education lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5872)|
| 1:38:01| And we recommend that to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| And then this board looks at that resume or whatever and decides whether or not they want to hire this particular person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| If not, it bounces back to us and we'll come up with another name of some ADA education lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| There are very few of them in the state of Tennessee, very few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| And we have the best there are in the state of Tennessee in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| But if you want to hire somebody to, say, advise us, we're not going to turn down anybody's advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5904)|
| 1:38:32| So it's up to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| But keep in mind, whoever, if you adopt this resolution and you all hire somebody, they're not taking over the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5917)|
| 1:38:47| We continue, we're required to, and we'll continue to do the litigation in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| And we are dead set against any judge telling us what we must do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5933)|
| 1:39:00| I don't know why it gets out in social media that our office is not, is in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5940)|
| 1:39:08| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| We raised the constitutional issue about separation of powers, that one judge shouldn't come over and take over what the legislative bodies are to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5949)|
| 1:39:19| We've raised that issue, and it's up in the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| We have raised every conceivable issue could be raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| And it's up in the Sixth Circuit on appeal now, and it was before Judge Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| Director Boock, I understand that county commission, through the resolution, gave the board the ability to ask for outside counsel to advise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5971)|
| 1:39:40| Did you have that ability before, like if you chose to, did you have that ability to do that before county commission gave us the authority to ask you to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5980)|
| 1:39:50| We could hire under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| If we have a conflict of interest, we can hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| Or if we need additional help, yes, we would have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| Is there a reason why you chose up until this point not to hire outside counsel for this particular case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| Number one, because we've got the best there are when it comes to ADA education, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6008)|
| 1:40:15| I've been practicing for 40-some-odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| I've been doing education law for the last 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| We had Susan Crabtree, who was without a doubt the best in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| Many of you may remember Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| Susan retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| We have right now in our office two people that worked and learned under Susan Crabtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| They are the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| So, no, we didn't consider having to go to the taxpayer's expense to hire somebody else that was going to tell us the same thing that our own staff was telling us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6036)|
| 1:40:46| So I appreciate you saying that if the board asked you to, you would certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| But it sounds like, in your opinion, you have not felt like it's needed up until this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| That's very accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| And then the last question that I have is, given what's happening in the case this week and the potential proposal and the other suit that's been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6061)|
| 1:41:12| do you think those additional movements in the case and the additional complications now might shift your opinion on the need for outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6072)|
| 1:41:21| or does that remain the same in light of the new facts that Mr. Dupler raised tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6081)|
| 1:41:28| No, I don't think we need outside counsel to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| That's my honest opinion, I think, with our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| And keep in mind, out of our staff of ten attorneys, eight, eight of those attorneys, all with federal practice out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6095)|
| 1:41:44| I've been federal 40 years in front of the Eastern District Federal Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| With all that intelligence and experience coming together, no, I don't think we need any extra in view of what's happened this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6109)|
| 1:41:58| Thank you, Director Vick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| Chair, Director Buick, I just have a couple questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| You said eight attorneys have been currently working on this case, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| So what have those eight attorneys been doing before this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| You had eight attorneys to just focus solely on this case, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| I didn't say solely on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| We operate in our office as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| When we have any issues that come up or lawsuits, we meet together in a conference room and we discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| And everybody's got their experience and they bring to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| So, no, I haven't had eight attorneys doing solely this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| We've got some 65 lawsuits out there, several involving the schools, in addition to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6159)|
| 1:42:47| How many suggestions have you made to this board to strengthen our case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| It seems like everything that's been filed has been reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| So how many suggestions have you brought to us to strengthen this case that's been going on for five months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| I don't understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Number one, you said something about reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| When you are a defendant, you react to what's been filed against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| How many medical experts have you talked to before February on this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| We had no chance to prior to that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| The lawsuit, if you read the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| I've read the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| If you read that transcript, you will find that we had a total of, what, three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| Three days to prepare for that hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| Three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| Back in September, I was told that we had a solid case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| We have a slam-dunk case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Now, all of a sudden, we were ambushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| Which one is it, Director Butte?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| I've lost you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| I don't think we ever said we had a slam-dunk case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| That was mentioned back in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| By whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| By Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| By who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| Mr. Who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| David Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| Oh, no, it's not a slam-dunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| And David Sanders wouldn't have said it's a slam-dunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| What we have is a strong, strong case on appeal that, with regard to that, should be won on appeal whenever the Sixth Circuit gets around to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6244)|
| 1:44:15| Last month, Director Butte, you didn't even know the basic facts of this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| You thought we were still peaking in Knox County when the peak was, in fact, a month before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| I've lost you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| What about the facts of the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| Last month, at County Commission, you didn't know the basic facts of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| You thought we were still peaking in Knox County, but we had peaked a month prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| I said because it was peaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| That's what I said, because that's what the judge said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| It was peaked when he came to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| Now it's peaking down, and that's why we've changed and filed these motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| What more can I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| The facts of the case are that it had peaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| That was the facts before the judge and in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| You also thought we have 800 kids with speech issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| That's 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Yeah, 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Oh, you're mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Okay, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| I made a mistake when I said 800, because it's 8,000, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| When I said 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| Yes, it is 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| I apologize if the 800 misled anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| I don't think it misled anybody with regard to what's happening in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| So you don't think that the fact that our kids have been in masks for five months, we don't need all hands on deck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| I don't know any company, Mr. Buick, that has in-house counsel that handles every case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6336)|
| 1:45:42| They always hire outside experts to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| We are not a normal outside business corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| So you're fine with our kids being masked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| We don't need all hands on deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| We don't need to do everything we can to get these kids out of masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Ask one question at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| Which one are you asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| You don't think we need all hands on deck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| You don't think we need extra tools in our toolbox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| We don't need extra what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| Tools in our toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| What's an extra tool in a legal toolbox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Thank you, Director Buick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| If you'll refine that for me, I'll answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| I'm going to direct my question to Mr. Dupleur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| You're also equipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| Mr. Dupleur, I just want clarification because once I finally understood about the joint recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6382)|
| 1:46:29| what do we need to do to move that forward as a school board body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| Or what would be your recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| So, you know, to be able to file something with the court, you know, as a joint motion or recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6399)|
| 1:46:49| I mean, both sides would have to agree upon it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| So it would require a vote of the board to go in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| and then obviously the plaintiffs would then have to follow through and agree as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| and then we could file that with the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| And is there a way for us to vote on this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| And, you know, when I look at the policies, this board can have a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| and normally the special called meeting has to have 48 hours' notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| but it also talks about in case of emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| and that's defined as a sudden, generally unexpected occurrence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| or set of circumstances demanding immediate action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| So with a court order coming out today, then this board might consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| So could a member of our board call for a special meeting to take place after this meeting tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| It would either have to be set by the chair or by a vote of the majority of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6464)|
| 1:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| Ms. Chair, the ball's in your court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| So we can have an emergency special called meeting immediately after this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| If you feel that this is an emergency, that is allowed under B161.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| So let's proceed with that then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| and we'll just vote on whether we are going to enter into that agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6493)|
| 1:48:21| and you can read it again at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| Enter into a proposal to end the mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| a joint proposal to end the mask mandate while mediation is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| And Mr. Dupler, could you, since that meeting will be directly after this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| could you work on language for that motion, given that you have the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6522)|
| 1:48:49| Yes, but I think it would be very similar to what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| I mean, I don't know that we want to get into, you know, super precise wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| I just want to make sure that we have good wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6541)|
| 1:49:11| Anything that will help get this thing resolved immediately is an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| So, yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| So there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| We will have an emergency call meeting immediately after this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| I just want to be clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| We're going to deem it an emergency meeting and meet right after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6573)|
| 1:49:41| But the public is not going to know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| Do you realize that we're going to take action before the public ever has notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| that we're dealing with it, unless they're watching?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| Yes, I asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| You know, I agree with what you're saying, and in the vast majority of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| it calls for a 48-hour notice before a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| I'm just pointing out to the board that there is this exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| and I gave the definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| and the board chair and the superintendent feel like it's an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| so that's the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| Well, I understand the rationale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| but I don't know what you can accomplish in a day or two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| except to make the public informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| and I would feel better about it if the public were informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| before we actually voted on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6645)|
| 1:50:51| My personal preference would be that we do it Wednesday night as opposed to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6651)|
| 1:50:58| I don't think anything can be accomplished tonight that would speed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6658)|
| 1:51:10| So can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| So my understanding from talking to you, Gary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6673)|
| 1:51:19| is that if we proceed with this tonight and agree to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| that would allow us to approach Judge Greer with the plaintiffs jointly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| possibly tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| and ask that the mandate be lifted while we're mediating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| and the judge could actually potentially respond by Wednesday even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| That's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| I mean, you know, that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| So, I mean, Mr. McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| if you're asking about what would speed up the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| that would be the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| I just want to be sure as to what we were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| and what we intended to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| These chairs are at the wrong height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| Mr. McMillan, I appreciate your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| but I don't think that it will come as a shock to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| that this board wants our kids out of masks as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| So, for that reason, I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| I would concur that we should do a vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| So, for that reason, I think that this is a special circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| Ms. Hillen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| I feel like we have already given our attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| and our negotiators the permission to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| So, I think this is just making it more official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| that they can make this specific proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| So, I don't feel like it's out of line with what the community is expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| I mean, that kind of crossed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| I mean, we've already given Ms. Christie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| and the law department and Mr. Myers the ability to negotiate on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| So, this is really, I mean, they could technically do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| without the approval of the board, could they not, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| No, because, I mean, the negotiation is non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| So, if a settlement is reached through Chair Christie and Jason Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6807)|
| 1:53:35| it would still have to come back before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| So, this is, if you want to be expeditious, this would be the way to approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| I think there might be more public backlash to not do it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| than there would be to do it, but that's just my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6827)|
| 1:53:54| Okay, so, do we have any more discussion on Item D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6834)|
| 1:54:07| Okay, so, moving on to Item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| Ms. Henderson, I believe this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| I'll try not to push my button again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| So, with this, you know, we've had a lot going on in the past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| and we have a lot of parents who are beyond frustrated and angry at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| and I just want, in writing, that, you know, just to reaffirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| that we still believe that math should be the choice of parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| You know, even today, we've had three or four different things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| and I also want, in writing, so that the law department just has that document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| just to strengthen any motions they have going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| It's always been our position, but I would like it, in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| in a vote, again, to give it to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| Ms. Phelan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Mr. Dupler, would this resolution change anything that the law department is doing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6901)|
| 1:55:11| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| I mean, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| I mean, I think Ms. Henderson is saying that it would reaffirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6915)|
| 1:55:22| and I believe that would be an accurate representation because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| a specific answer to your question, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| I mean, if you were to vote for this resolution, we would still be doing the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6930)|
| 1:55:37| which is fighting as hard as we can to unmask the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6937)|
| 1:55:46| So any more discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| Item F, I believe this is also yours, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| I've had a very busy week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| So with this resolution, you know, I've talked to several schools last year, also this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| that some schools are doing normal activities and some schools are not doing normal activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| and, you know, some are using the excuse of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| And our children need their childhood back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| and I think that the board needs a resolution to prove or to say that all normal activities need to resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6976)|
| 1:56:24| I've talked to schools that have canceled their Veterans Day program this year, spelling bees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6984)|
| 1:56:31| limited parents for Christmas parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| I've talked to schools that have canceled field trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| and limiting parents and not having events at this point in time is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=6997)|
| 1:56:45| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| I feel like this is an administrative decision and not appropriate for board consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| This is something that has to do with individual principals making those decisions for their buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7014)|
| 1:57:03| and our superintendent overseeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| And I would argue that this is exactly the reason why we need this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| because there is so much confusion, lack of clarity, principals acting on their own behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7033)|
| 1:57:20| even against what this board has said and what our superintendent has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| and for some reason they feel like they have the ability to go against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7045)|
| 1:57:32| And I think it just needs to be entirely stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| and clarified to the administrators at the schools that this is what this board intends for them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7056)|
| 1:57:44| for the remainder of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| And therein is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| It's the individual administrations at each school determining their own actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| and it needs to be unified across this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| You know, I know Ms. Henderson brought something similar last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| It was closer to the end of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| and so at that time my concern was that it was so close to the end of the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| that it could cause difficulties in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| However, we are now a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| We still have issues going on in schools that kids are being limited to various things across schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7096)|
| 1:58:23| and like Ms. Bounds said, principals making decisions on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| So I feel like we are at March, the beginning of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| There's plenty of time for principals to understand that the expectation of this board is that we return to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7111)|
| 1:58:40| We represent the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| So if this is what our communities are telling us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| this is a way for this board to communicate that to the superintendent who will then carry that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7126)|
| 1:58:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| Superintendent Thomas, can you speak to the issue at hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Yeah, can you speak to the resolution that Ms. Henderson is bringing forth around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| what's the title of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| Sorry, I got it rolled down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| Yeah, all school activities should return to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| There's some concern that maybe some schools are not doing that and, you know, kind of going their own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| Can you just speak to that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| Sure, and again, I agree with the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| We've talked about it as a staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| I think the situation now is much better, obviously, than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| And for the benefit of our students and our families, that's what we're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| I support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| That's not exactly my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| So I think we're all in agreement in terms of the intent of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| I'm asking, do you have any information or understanding around what's happening across the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| where maybe schools are not doing normal activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| I don't have specific examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| But the statement was made that principals make the decision at the school level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| and certainly we've authorized our principals to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| But as far as saying that it's consistent across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| I would be surprised if it were consistent across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| So, again, if the board wants to approve this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| then we'll make sure that the consistency is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| I don't have specific examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| Sorry, Superintendent Thomas, I'm not trying to push on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| but the way you just said that, you said, if this resolution passes, then we will make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| Are you not making sure now because we don't have this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| I'd have to, I think I grade level directors, and I don't know if, yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7240)|
| 2:00:47| Ms. Thompson's here, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| I guess what I'm asking is, you've said this is something we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| and what I'm trying to understand is, does this help you do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| or does that make sense what I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| Well, I think it helps, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| If the board approves this, I think it does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| I mean, this is what the board wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| This is what the community wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| And we want to be sure that we do what the board directs us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| and do that with fidelity and consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| And I know we've had conversations about this over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| So, Ms. Thompson, if you, Madam Chair, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| So, we did have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| We've had this discussion a couple times, and I think we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| Danny Trent is my counterpart, secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| He is out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| But he and I both have communicated to our principals that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| effective March the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| then we should be resuming normal activities such as field days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| and awards days, ceremonies, all of those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| Schools should be returned to our practices based on the way they were before COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7313)|
| 2:02:03| Now, I will say that there have been some activities that principals have gotten creative with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7323)|
| 2:02:11| and have learned some things during this two-year time to be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7331)|
| 2:02:17| and just a variety of things that we've learned in this experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| But we do want to encourage parents to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7341)|
| 2:02:27| We want to encourage children to be able to have their parents with them at field days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| if that was their normal practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| We do have some schools who are limited based on their capacity of the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7355)|
| 2:02:43| We have some schools that have really, in these last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| their enrollment has expanded far beyond what it was pre-pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| And so for us to say everybody should allow parents to come and have lunch with their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7373)|
| 2:03:00| and allow that, some schools just do not have the capacity to physically do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7380)|
| 2:03:06| And so we've asked them, whatever limitations they've placed has not been because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7386)|
| 2:03:14| It's because of not being able to seat children and parents together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| Now, some of our schools have outside picnic tables and other ways to accommodate parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7399)|
| 2:03:27| And we just are encouraging principals to get creative as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| But I believe that our principals can make that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| and make families feel comfortable coming and visiting schools and feel welcome without having a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7418)|
| 2:03:47| That's my opinion because I feel like they're, in general, are welcoming to having parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7427)|
| 2:03:55| and getting back to normal as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| I think there could be some unintended consequences of having a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7439)|
| 2:04:04| and taking that authority out of principals' hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| So I'm happy to answer any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| Ms. Selwyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| Unintended consequences is exactly what I wanted to ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| So if I understand correctly, last week you have already asked principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| to go back to resuming normal activities as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| Do you feel like if we adopted this resolution that it might cause some principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7469)|
| 2:04:36| to feel that they've been hamstrung, that they've been asked not to do innovative things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7476)|
| 2:04:42| that they have found over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| So I feel there might be situations where principals cannot physically accommodate parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7486)|
| 2:04:54| I know we have situations where principals cannot physically accommodate having parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| to come and eat lunch with their children, as a specific example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| And if there is a policy and parents bring the policy that says we should let them do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7504)|
| 2:05:11| then that puts them in a situation of breaking board policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| when they physically cannot accommodate parents in the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| So you're saying that if we put this in place, there may be that expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| that because it's happening at this school, the parent is going to expect it to happen at this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| when maybe it never happened here to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| Ms. Thompson, can you kind of help us with some of these examples of the creative ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7539)|
| 2:05:47| that principals have found over the last two years that work really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| that they're doing now in place of what they used to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| What are some of your examples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| So again, I said the picnic table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| So we've had principals that have tried to accommodate parents during the pandemic time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7562)|
| 2:06:10| where they would allow them to come and schedule times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| They've had times where they have been flexible with their lunch schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7573)|
| 2:06:20| and allowed children to eat in the classrooms or eat in the cafeteria or eat in the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7580)|
| 2:06:27| just to try to make those accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| First, I would like to say that I've worked under a lot of principals over 23 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7593)|
| 2:06:39| or over a 40-year span in Knox County, and I have the utmost respect for our principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| But at the same time, I know you and I last year dealt with a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7606)|
| 2:06:51| after the superintendent clearly stated that children were not to be masked on the playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7611)|
| 2:06:58| and yet my granddaughter continued to have to wear a mask many weeks after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7618)|
| 2:07:06| and I came back to you several times, and finally that class was allowed to unmask on the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7626)|
| 2:07:14| So that's an example from last year, but I also know there are examples this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7634)|
| 2:07:20| and Mr. Watson, I can provide you with a lot of them if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| There seems to be a big difference between the elementary and the secondary as far as how that looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7644)|
| 2:07:33| I don't want to create problems for our administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| That's not my intent at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| But I do want the Knox County to realize that when this board directs the superintendent to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7659)|
| 2:07:50| and the superintendent directs the administration to do something, that they should follow those directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7670)|
| 2:07:57| And I think that has, over the past two years, I know in one of my schools in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| that parents were able to come to lunch prior to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| and to my knowledge this year they still were not allowed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| but they were using the spacing as a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| And so I think there's a little bit of, I hate to say it, but I think we can find reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7697)|
| 2:08:25| if we want to, to limit the amount of interaction in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| So I would support this resolution, and I feel strongly that while I respect our administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| they need to all be held accountable for what the superintendent has mandated or stated in his meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7717)|
| 2:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7726)|
| 2:08:47| Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7727)|
| 2:08:48| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| I was just going to point out, again, in the resolution, it says to the greatest extent possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7730)|
| 2:08:55| So I think that does give some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| If it's not a possible, if it's something that's not possible, then you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| So I think the flexibility is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| It's written into the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| Who's next? Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7752)|
| 2:09:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| I appreciate you pointing that out, Superintendent Thomas, because that's what I would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| I pulled up the resolution just to relook at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| It's not a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7761)|
| 2:09:22| It's basically a position statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| And so I feel like that it is important for this board to make this position statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| because going back to what Ms. Bowne said, I don't know how many calls we've gotten over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| that so and such and such school is doing this, even though we had had conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| and we had been assured that principles had been directed otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| So I feel like the whole community needs to know what this board's position on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| and board members can vote on it if they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| But if we vote in the affirmative on this, I feel like that our community will know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| every staff member will know, principals can blame it on us if they have teachers that don't want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| that this is the board's expectation that we're giving to the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| So I intend to vote to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| Ms. Horn and Mr. Thomas, I was going to say the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| that this really is a position statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| It doesn't have the weight of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| And Ms. Bowne, the reason I asked Superintendent Thomas that isn't because I don't know of instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7818)|
| 2:10:24| in our own schools where that occurs, but I thought given that the board gave examples of when it is occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| it was important to give the superintendent the chance to speak to his knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7830)|
| 2:10:35| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| I just want to reiterate what Superintendent Thomas and Ms. Horn said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| I did write this as a resolution, not a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| and I did specifically put in there the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| I wrote in there the greatest extent possible, so it did have that flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| but also gave that clarification of this is what we expect as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7852)|
| 2:10:59| so that our community can go back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| Ms. Bowne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| Just a quick question for Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| I know you brought something similar at the end of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| It was in the form of policy last year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| And so this is shifting into more of a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| Yes, so last year I did write it as a policy because I was hearing many of the same concerns from parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| and I did write it as a policy last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| And last year had some more stricter guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| I would say some teeth in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| And so that's why I'm writing it just as a resolution this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| so that we do have just some clarification and flexibility in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7902)|
| 2:11:43| Ms. Bowne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| And I guess I would say, if this is passed, that as Ms. Thompson talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| we're talking about curtailing events because of COVID, that we keep seeing excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| There obviously are reasons that certain things have changed at schools because of size and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| but we're not wanting COVID to be used as the reason a school is not doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| That's kind of what I think this is being done as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| whereas there might be good reasons where they no longer can have parents come in the same way as before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| just because of the size of the school or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| I've heard from schools that have grown in the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| and maybe you can't have lunch as often with your children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| but I have heard from many, many parents this year that some have used COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| while others, you know, some schools are having spillover meetings, some aren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| and I'm hearing the ones that are not are maybe saying COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| So that's why I brought forth this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7953)|
| 2:12:39| So any more discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| So moving on to item G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7963)|
| 2:12:46| Mr. Dupler, did you want to start with this one or Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7966)|
| 2:12:55| Your name is by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| Well, thanks, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| I don't know that I want to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| Mr. McMillan, do you want to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| No, I want you to start with a definition, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7983)|
| 2:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| Well, I guess I can start with the fact that the Ethics Committee met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| and in that Ethics Committee meeting, the discussion, and it's public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=7997)|
| 2:13:23| but the discussion was are these on their face ethics complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8003)|
| 2:13:29| which require some type of conflict of interest, financially motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| So the consensus in the vote of the meeting, or the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| was that they weren't ethics complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| but these are complaints that appear to be on their face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| alleging violations of board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| So that's why it was then shifted to the entire board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| which the other point to make is even if these were ethics complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| I mean, what would happen is that there would have to be a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| and then the Ethics Committee would then recommend something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8045)|
| 2:14:11| and then it would go to the whole board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| which the whole board would have to vote on this sooner or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| But, again, not ethics complaints as espoused by the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8055)|
| 2:14:22| And so now they're here before the board under B171,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| and there's been some discussion individually about B171.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| Well, that's really the only policy that one can point to from the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| to handle complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| The question has been raised, well, isn't it more for employee complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| or parent complaints or things like that that would then rise up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| and that is what the policy is designed for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| complaints that would rise up from teacher to principal to higher administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8089)|
| 2:14:55| and then eventually to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| But when you've got complaints about board members, well, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| you know, you start at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| So here they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| And then the other question that was raised individually was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| well, what about a procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| Well, I mean, you know, if you look at B171, it's pretty vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8110)|
| 2:15:16| I mean, it just talks about complaints are submitted to the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8116)|
| 2:15:21| and then those have to be seven days before the regular board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8121)|
| 2:15:26| and then the board can then discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| And presumably the complainant would then have to present the complaint before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8129)|
| 2:15:35| So that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| Back to you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| Thank you, Mr. Dupree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| I'll just add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| The three-member ethics committee did vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8144)|
| 2:15:52| and it was unanimous to send it to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| That's all I have to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8158)|
| 2:16:04| Mr. Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| Mr. McMillan, as the chair of the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| and I understand the vote and appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| and to Mr. Dupree's point, B171 is very vague in terms of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8172)|
| 2:16:18| It really wasn't designed for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| Did the ethics committee discuss some type of process for the board to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| on Wednesday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| Because what it probably should not be is a free-for-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| So is there any recommendation from the ethics committee in terms of a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8188)|
| 2:16:33| to discuss this on Wednesday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| Well, everything that we discussed, we discussed in front of Mr. Dupree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8200)|
| 2:16:49| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| We thought that we would pass it on to the entire board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| and then see what they wanted to do with it, how they wanted to pursue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8217)|
| 2:17:05| So, I mean, the ethics committee has done about as much as we could do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8225)|
| 2:17:14| Mr. Watts, and we didn't discuss in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8234)|
| 2:17:20| We talked a little bit about what might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| But I'll just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| We're into a situation now where we're getting complaints right and left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| We're going to spend more time dealing with that than we do on the business of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8256)|
| 2:17:43| if we don't bring it to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| And I think this was part of the hopes that we would be able to bring it to an end on Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8267)|
| 2:17:59| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| Yes, Mr. McMillan, and I completely agree with your sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| And I guess my thought is maybe the one thing that the board should discuss tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| in relationship to this is how will this be handled on Wednesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| because I don't think we want to make it up as we go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| since there's not really any guidance in terms of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| Well, other than Mr. McMillan, I think I'm the longest serving board member on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| and Mr. McMillan and I have had opportunities to watch a lot of different compositions of boards over the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8311)|
| 2:18:40| me over the last eight years and him longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| And what really concerns me is the board's job is about educating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| So based on that, I will be bringing a motion on Wednesday night, and I would like to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8330)|
| 2:18:58| a motion to dismiss all pending complaints against all board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| on the grounds of the strained political status of the community and officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8343)|
| 2:19:09| particularly around masking, and on the grounds that board policies B-171 and B-220 need revision specification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8349)|
| 2:19:20| on procedure and forms for filing complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| So I think that addresses somewhat of what Mr. Watson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| I think it needs to go back to board policy, which we're having on March 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8368)|
| 2:19:33| and we need to work on these policies as to how these complaints come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8373)|
| 2:19:38| I will be making a motion to dismiss all of the complaints at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8378)|
| 2:19:43| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8383)|
| 2:19:44| Could you have that motion, the wording of it, sent to the board through Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| Yes, I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| Mr. Dupour, did you have something you needed to add or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| I think Ms. Bounds kind of headed it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| I mean, I was just going to say that the Ethics Committee did talk about, as far as process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| talked about that B-220 doesn't set out a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8405)|
| 2:20:11| but previous Ethics Committees have a process for hearings before that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8411)|
| 2:20:18| but specifically this Ethics Committee talked about needing a formal complaint form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8418)|
| 2:20:24| and looking at that for policy review, and that's also something that would benefit B-171.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8424)|
| 2:20:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| In our Ethics Committee, we did discuss the prior process that was laid out for hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8436)|
| 2:20:43| and it was my understanding that that process has sort of already been put in motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8443)|
| 2:20:51| because we have already contacted all of the people who have filed complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8451)|
| 2:20:58| for them to come and be a part of a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| So if we have already put that process in motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| and the people who have made complaints are expecting to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8467)|
| 2:21:12| I'm not sure that it will be a very good look for us to ask these people to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8472)|
| 2:21:23| within this small amount of time to agree to be here for a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| and then tell them, no, you don't get to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| And I know that some of these are against me, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8491)|
| 2:21:35| and I don't think it's fair for us to ask these people to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| and then tell them, no, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| If I can address that, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| and that is exactly why I brought this motion that I will be making Wednesday night forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| so that all of you would be aware and the people that have been contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8512)|
| 2:21:58| will also be aware that there is a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| because I don't want to inconvenience anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| but I really believe strongly that we need to dismiss all of these pending complaints against the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8525)|
| 2:22:12| So I think most of them probably are watching this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8532)|
| 2:22:17| and so they will have the knowledge that this could pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| and if it passes, that would eliminate their coming before the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| So that's why I brought it tonight instead of waiting until Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8549)|
| 2:22:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| I had every intention of doing what Ms. Bounds is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| but it's fine if she brings it because we've got to put an end to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8557)|
| 2:22:49| because there will be people filing here, there, and yonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8569)|
| 2:22:55| If we try to hear them, we're not going to get anywhere, as I said a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| So it's time for it to stop, and I had every intention of us moving on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8581)|
| 2:23:09| just discuss getting and moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| There's nothing really that we could do to Board members except take a censure vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8593)|
| 2:23:21| and that would take five members, and I doubt seriously that that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8601)|
| 2:23:32| So, you know, I think as we speak, and I hesitate to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| but I think Ms. Bounds and myself are the only two Board members that don't have something filed against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8618)|
| 2:23:46| That's how ridiculous it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| I'm sorry. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| No, she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| Well, it was hinted at, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| Did you get what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8635)|
| 2:23:59| It's been hinted at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| Ms. Babb, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| Yeah, I just, I kind of, I think going along with what they're saying is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8643)|
| 2:24:07| I think there's some misunderstanding of school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8647)|
| 2:24:12| We really are who we are beholden to as our voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8652)|
| 2:24:16| and if they don't like us and they don't like what we're doing, you don't vote us back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| and we don't work for the superintendent, and I don't mean that in any way ugly to the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| but the way the structure is is we are elected, the superintendent is our employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| He has no authority over us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| Actually, no employees of Knox County Schools have any authority over us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| and I personally feel like I am a friend of everybody on the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| and we don't always disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| Oftentimes there's different ones of y'all I've probably disagreed with on almost everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| but at the end of the day, I am personally not going to come in judgment of the acts that my fellow board members are going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| That is not where I feel is my job either, and that's where I'm going to have a hard time with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| and actually there was something pointed out about if you have given money to somebody running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8703)|
| 2:25:10| you really shouldn't be in judgment of them, and I have given to somebody's campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| so I actually feel like I cannot judge anybody, so I wouldn't even be taking part in this next Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8714)|
| 2:25:20| because I just don't feel like it's an appropriate job for me to be judgmental of the people on my school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8720)|
| 2:25:27| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| Thank you, Madam Chair, and Ms. Babb, that's exactly what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| When I was chair, I was contacted on multiple occasions asking how we could deal with certain board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8731)|
| 2:25:40| and that was always my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| Board members are accountable to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| The voters are who the board members are accountable to, and that's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8745)|
| 2:25:52| Granted, there are going to be decisions that this board makes that the public does not like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| and that's just going to be the nature of it, but I think as Mr. McMillan said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| we could spend all of our time talking about that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| or we could talk about the thing that I know we all care about, and that we can all agree about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8764)|
| 2:26:11| I appreciated that Dr. Rice pointed that out during the community forum when he was speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| and I think we need to remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| I think that's such an important point that he made is that we're all here because we do care about children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| and we care about our students, and we want the best for every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| So I think we need to focus on those things and not on those places that we disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8787)|
| 2:26:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8793)|
| 2:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8799)|
| 2:26:45| So we will move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| We have one speaker that's registered this evening, Helena Rago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8811)|
| 2:26:58| She's not present, so Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| So we'll move on to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| Mr. Chen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| I guess we will go real quick because I understand that we have another called meeting after this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| but basically with spring break coming up, students, please do take a rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| You deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| We'll be back after one week, but for that one week, take a break, get some rest, relax, do some fun things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| And also, as I believe Ms. Christie pointed out earlier, the application for the student representative position for next year is open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8839)|
| 2:27:26| so please do apply for that if you're at all interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| We recently had a really good opening at the teacher supply depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8854)|
| 2:27:38| There has been a lot of massive organization going on with our staff at the teacher depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8858)|
| 2:27:45| and they have gone through everything in the whole place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8865)|
| 2:27:50| taken out things that are old and kind of disheveled and replaced them with lots and lots of new supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8870)|
| 2:27:59| I can't even tell you how many hundreds of three-ring binders went out the door this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8879)|
| 2:28:06| Lots and lots of very, very happy teachers with lots of supplies to finish out the school year strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8886)|
| 2:28:13| So we appreciate everyone who helped with that, all the student volunteers who helped with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8893)|
| 2:28:19| and especially the item on our agenda for additional funds for the teacher depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8899)|
| 2:28:26| because we have moved from that model where we were just begging for any little tiny used pencil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8906)|
| 2:28:33| to a model where we actually have new, brand-new things for our teachers to come and be able to use in their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8913)|
| 2:28:42| So if you haven't visited the depot, I encourage you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| Thank you. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8926)|
| 2:28:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| I know many of us got to go around the district this past week for Read USA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| and got to go into some of our classrooms and read with our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| I just wanted to say how much I appreciated that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| and also was so impressed with our educators and our young people and our administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| and the work that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| So I appreciate the sentiments here tonight in terms of focusing on education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| and making sure that we're about that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| So it's always good to be in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8953)|
| 2:29:16| And also, too, to echo what Mr. Ginn is saying is that my wife, being an educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8956)|
| 2:29:24| I know sometimes you never take that hat off even when you get an opportunity like a spring break or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| I just want to encourage our teachers and our other folks who work in our schools to find that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| and take some of that during the spring break because you certainly deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| Ms. Beth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| I also got to read at Rocky Hill Elementary to fifth graders and to Green Magnet kindergartners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8980)|
| 2:29:47| and it was a joy to do so, especially those hugs from the kindergartners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| Boy, that makes it worth being on school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| But I would just like to say I'm on the Partners in Education Board as a representative of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| and we are doing our skates and plates, and I would encourage anybody to look at the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| It's a really great video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| It highlights some of the needs in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| and I think actually Larson Jay is probably coming Wednesday to talk more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| But if you will look at the video, and I'll kind of send it out to all the members of our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| and you'll post it different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| It gives people an opportunity to give to some of these causes that are really needed by our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=9016)|
| 2:30:22| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| I just wanted to say thank you, too, for the schools that had me come read for Read Across America Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220307?start=9026)|
