| 0:05:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=343)|

| 0:05:50| Now, let me ask why, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| We have had the same issue that the governor of the state of Tennessee or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| attorney general has argued before the same judge of mask mandates and was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| turned down by this federal judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| This judge was shocked to get one to put this in the hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| They could have done it here in Knox County, but they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| They did it in Greene County because they had some way of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| this judge to stop the county schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| The attorney general argued it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| The attorney general argued the same thing in Middle Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| and the judge turned them down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| In Memphis, they turned them down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| The legislature passed legislation to do away with masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| and a judge in Middle Tennessee, a federal judge, stopped it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| Now, let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| That was the attorney general of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| That was the legislature of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| Now, I have not heard, and I'm using this from somebody else I heard this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| from, no lawyer ever stood up in any of our arguments that was placed to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| to say I can do it or I have a way of getting this passed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| The second thing is no one here has said the person or a name of a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=440)|
| 0:07:35| that can do better than the attorney general of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| Now, we can start right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| It will take at least three, maybe four months for a lawyer to get up to speed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| By the 31st of May, when school is out, it goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| Now, hey, you can start now, and it's three or four months down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| school will be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Gallery, please be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| Allow the commissioners to have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| So I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| I wouldn't have my kids in masks for nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| and I would take them out of school and put them in private schools if I had kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| to where they wouldn't have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| But the problem of it is you're going to go ahead and hire somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| and go back to that judge when these judges will not hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| They have requested more time in front of the judge to argue these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| what was brought up before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| And I even asked, the same issues that you brought up or that was brought up tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| was also argued by the law firms that's here in Knox County's courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| and they would not be heard by the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| These federal judges don't have to listen to any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| They can put it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| Now, what I'm saying is here, I don't want the mask to go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=548)|
| 0:09:16| but you've got to remember one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| There was four people here in Knoxville that said they could control all the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| All we had to do was find a judge that would pass it and would stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| and not hear the case again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| They found that judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| Now, they've gone through the appeals program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| They've done all this here through our law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| We can start it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| We can vote for them to spend that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| but you're not going to have that case heard until after school is out anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| Guys, please, no more outbursts from the gallery or I will clear the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| If a commissioner disagrees with what you've said, that is their prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| You've had your say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| We've listened to you patiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Please allow the commissioners to have debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| What I'm saying, thank you, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| what I'm saying is elections count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| We have less than 30% of the population of Knox County voting during any election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| and even in federal elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| and the federal people are the ones that appointed these judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Now, you can start now and try to get these people that have put this in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=626)|
| 0:10:34| that has put you in this situation, out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| You've got a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Use that voice and make sure that anybody tries it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| that they're going to be heard from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| Now, if I thought 100% that we could have some person that could do better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=646)|
| 0:10:55| and do the appeals better, I would want that person in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| But who is that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Who is that person that can do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Who is that person that can argue it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| And when you find them in any law firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| they're going to take three to four months before they can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| And even if they get there, we don't even know if they'll be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| if they can get to that appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| So I want to say, you know, I'm a lot older than a lot of you people out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=682)|
| 0:11:32| and I've gone through a lot of things, and I've seen a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| But we have not been really active in our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| And the only time we ever get active in our government is when something affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| And I want to take, like I said, I am for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| I want the mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| But why would you go down to a brick wall and stand there and beat on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| when you don't have the hammer to really get it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| And that's my thought right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| You can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| You can spend your money the way the thing reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| And three months from now, maybe it goes away, the 31st, when school's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| But the only other way we can get this done is, I believe, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| Hopefully, I'm talking to Mr. Boyers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| What can we do to hope for to get this thing over with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| Well, let me start by saying, first let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=748)|
| 0:12:36| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Did everybody get the report that the law director booted out over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| that lays out what the law director's office has done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| Some, like, 40 filings, hundreds of pages of legal argument and briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=766)|
| 0:12:55| I want to say that David Boock and David Sanders and Amanda Morse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| who have worked on this case, do not disagree with anything that was said today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| about wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Nobody in our office wants this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| But we were kind of ambushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| We got served by this on a Friday and had to be in court by a Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| And we asked the judge for more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| He didn't give it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| So we've had to work with what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| Now, I will tell you, for those who don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| before I came here this time, I spent about 15 years being a judge myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| And things don't always go your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| I still can't get used to the way they changed the buttons since the last time I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Once a judge makes a decision, he's going to want something that he thinks is a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| before he's going to change his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Because when you go back to the judge, you're saying, judge, here's why you're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| And I can tell you, judges, it takes a bit to get them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| And the thing that was interesting to me when I read this opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| is within the first paragraph of the judge's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| he points out that the county was voting not to have a mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| although it was recommended by the CDC, the American Association of Pediatrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| and the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Now, that's telling to me because it suggests that that's what the judge wants to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| as a change in circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| I think that these organizations are moving in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| because the numbers are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| And I know that we are in the process, without talking too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| about going back to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| But I have not heard, apart from just the general idea that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=908)|
| 0:15:17| well, if we had somebody else, maybe things would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| I have not heard any arguments that a judge is going to recognize at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=923)|
| 0:15:32| that are going to change this judge's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| Now, we are going to try, and we're working on going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| We have filed various motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| They've been shot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| We filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| and we asked for the Sixth Circuit to dissolve the injunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| while we were waiting to get the case on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| and the Sixth Circuit summarily dismissed that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| And as Commissioner Buster was saying, it's not just us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| Next to us in that case in Knox County was, at least in spirit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| the governor of the state of Tennessee being represented by the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| of the state of Tennessee and all of the assets and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| at that attorney general's command, and he lost too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| And he not only lost in East Tennessee, but he lost in Middle Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| and he lost in West Tennessee with all the resources of the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| of the state of Tennessee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| They haven't sought outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| And then the state legislature passed a statute saying no mask mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| and guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Another federal judge in Middle Tennessee stopped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| Again, although it was being defended by the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| and all the resources at his command.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| One last thing, and, you know, this is difficult for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| because I don't disagree, and I know that Mr. Boock does not disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| with the people who find it extraordinarily frustrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| that we are stuck with this at the time being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| and we are taking every prudent step to get it reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| But I want to say one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| There's been a lot of talk today about the school board wants this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| the school board wants this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| The school board has not voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| The school board has not asked this commission for outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| The school board has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| And this resolution gives the school board something that it hasn't asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| And I think that that bears consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| that if the school board wants outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| the school board should say that in an official way by a vote of its members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| which is the only way a corporate body like this body acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| That hasn't happened yet at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| So I'm happy to answer any other questions anybody has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| but that's having listened to everybody today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| and having felt your pain and frustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| those are the things that I felt it was important to say on behalf of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Thank you, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| I believe Commissioner Ward is next and then Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| Well, I thought you were finished when you sat back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| I said thank him for that piece of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| So what we have before us is a request by three individuals, not the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Well, it was by one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| I can't speak for the other two that showed up at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| It's only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| It was by the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| So can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| We're voting on something that's not really been asked for us to do properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| I'll speak to those two comments real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| I don't believe we're giving the school board anything besides options in their tool belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| They still have to vote to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| It's still their call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| We're just giving them power to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| We're not making the decision for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| They're making the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| For all this, I always want to remember I'm elected by people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| and the people are the ones that are coming to us saying that we're frustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| that we're tired of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| We want somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| That's who I'm elected by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| That's who I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| So this is what the people want, and I've had more people reach out to me now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| than I had during COVID two years ago, and we all went through that together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| and we saw how that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| There's more people tonight than there was during that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| And, you know, there's a bunch of us stuck to our guts then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| and we were proven right down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| I feel like we're in a similar position that I want to stick to my guts again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| knowing that I'm doing the right thing, and we'll see what happens down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| But I'm not making a decision for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| I'm just giving them an option, and they, as a collective group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| who are also elected officials by the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| will then have to make a decision for themselves whether to utilize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| or not utilize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| It was up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| I would give them the power at both our outside council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| or our outside council to help the current council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| I would give them every option possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| That's my personal opinion on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| So tonight we are voting on an updated or revised version of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| from last Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| From last week, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| And so I'm currently trying to go through the changes that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| and compare the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| And please correct me if I'm wrong in these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| The one change is that we are voting on to hire an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| to further assist the law director rather than replacing the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| That the Board of Education must vote to approve the choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| of the law director's chosen attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| That is how the resolution reads, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| And then that any funds that will be necessary for said outside council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| or for said advisory council would come from the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| That is also correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Those are – am I missing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| I don't believe there's another change, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Will it go to the Board of Education to decide if they want to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| or will it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| No, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| I believe there's a line in there that says that the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| does not take effect unless and until the Board of Education approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| I was just looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| I just see it where it says it won't take effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| if they don't approve the chosen counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Before that, I believe, Commissioner, I'm going to look back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| I thought I had seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| I just don't see it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| And so that was –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| I'm going to wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| Again, kind of going off of what Commissioner Ward said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| one additional tool in the tool belt for this litigation that's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| my support in this resolution is completely separate from the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| against the Board of Education and the subject matter to which it pertains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| Rather, my support for this resolution is solely based on the basic fundamentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| of governmental operations and the separation of powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| I am of the opinion, and based on my experience working for the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| that Knox County Law Department exists to represent various departments of Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| that the Board of Education is an elected body, not necessarily a county department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| and therefore should at minimum be given the authority to acquire separate counsel in legal matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| if desired by said board and by full board's approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| especially in matters in which the law department may be in conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| And so that's why I will support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Mr. Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| When does this order end, Judge Greer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| It is a temporary restraining order that will end when we have a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| either when the Sixth Circuit reverses it or when we have a full hearing on a permanent situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| which the judge has not yet set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| So it is not unreasonable to think that it could go into the next school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| I don't think that's likely to happen because I think that either Judge Greer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| or the Sixth Circuit is going to act on it before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| But can I say it's possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Sure, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Anything is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| I do note, and really not to sound redundant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| that the resolution we are authorizing outside counsel to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1490)|
| 0:25:05| And it would make sense for outside counsel, if in fact this occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| to be someone that I wouldn't think that the school board and law director could agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| because, after all, they're going to have to all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| So you would hope that that would almost be without saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| But I get that that should be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| I strongly support what our mayor spoke to last week in just the additional bandwidth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:37| Sometimes you just need a little more help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| I can only imagine, with our law department already having their hands full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| with your 10 or 12 attorneys trying to do everything you've done to defend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| and take care of Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| and then I'm hearing and heard Mr. Brooks say last week that all 10 of their attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1555)|
| 0:26:04| have been working almost full time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| So at any rate, it's almost like I would hope that they would welcome the fact that this could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| Also, the resolution does state that if this occurs through these other caveats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| that Knox County schools will, in fact, carry the financial burden of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| So that is another thing that may, in fact, almost encourage our law department to accept other counsel in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:38| So I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| This has been an interesting discussion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| and I'm glad to have heard from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| It was also interesting to watch the school board meeting last time when they debated this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| and almost immediately the school board voted to support the law director's position and team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:10| and then immediately a few people came, and this resolution is by way of the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| who, after their board said go forth and continue on, took a different course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| So it has been interesting to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| I also find it a little ironic that many of the same people that argued a long time in the last referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| that we must elect our law director are the exact same, many of the same groups who are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| we want other options instead of appointing a law director, and that's a whole different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| I have a question for Mr. Moyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Just to be clear, this is not a blanket authorization for all outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| It has to be specific to this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| If they wanted any further outside counsel, they would still have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| In six months, they wanted outside counsel for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| They would still have to come back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Under our charter and under the previous litigation between the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| and this county commission that occurred almost exactly 20 years ago, that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| I think it's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| I think it was Commissioner Durrett that said, that talked about that this is really only in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| if now it goes back and the Board of Education has to approve it to even start the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| and then it is going to go back and forth and back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| So if they do this, if we do this, they're going to do that, then the law director is going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| I mean, it's probably going to be June or July by the time we get to who might be the counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| but that's their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| That's not our decision, so I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| Ultimately, I think it may turn out to be an exercise in futility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| and be resources that the school could be better spent in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| because it may be resolved by the time we get through this back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| but I'm inclined to give them an option to hold their own destiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| and to make those decisions by themselves and be accountable for those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| So I'm inclined to support it, and if the Board of Education wants to go down that path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| and spend the money and go through the exercise, that ultimately is up to their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| We're not the school board, so I'm inclined to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| and as Commissioner Ward said, give them a tool in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| If they decide to use it, great, but what will be interesting is if it goes back to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| and then they vote and they don't pass it to take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| everybody who came to us tonight is going to come right back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| and we are not the school board, and we have to really understand that we are the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| We are not the educational body, which is an educational body for the state education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| It's not a local issue, so I'm inclined to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| I appreciate your time, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| Thank you, Mr. J. Mr. Biggs, you're next, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| I've got a couple questions, and then, well, let's just start off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| Either Director Caldwell or Ron from schools, one of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| I just want something explained to me real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:25| Oh, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| Ron's smarter than me, so I'll probably let him answer, but go ahead and ask your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| It's a BEP funding question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| It's going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Ron or Chris, so we all hear about the BEP funding and things of that nature and students in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:50| At what point does or can it affect our funding for our schools with the 3,000 students and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| that have switched out of Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| If I understand your question, are you saying, well, a reduction in enrollment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| I can't give you an exact figure because the BEP is so fluid with respect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| they don't fund it on a per-pupil level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| I mean, you can do a calculation at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Here's what my funding is versus, you know, and these are my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| You know, this is the enrollment, and this is how much it would average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| So they don't really do it on total enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| They do it on components, you know, within that BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| But I can say, yes, a reduction in enrollment would correspond to less funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| That's the answer I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| And I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| I don't need to explain anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| So here's my, I just wanted that answer, and the reason being is because I have a major fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| We just heard minutes ago that if this doesn't get handled, that there is a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| that it could go into next year's school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| And I do feel like if we see this possibility, that we will have a large exodus of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| go to private schools or go to other schools or go home school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| And we just heard that it could and will affect the funding to our Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| So I'm reading the room, and I feel like we're all in agreeance that we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| And I'm glad that we're all in agreeance that we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| I feel like we've been fighting this fight for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| But there's one thing in the resolution that I don't see that I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| It says, be it further resolved that this attorney shall have experience in cases involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| Is there anything that says that they have had prior federal law experience in federal court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| Well, both of those are federal acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| So it kind of implies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| Well, I guess that's the first part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| If this passes and if the Board of Education passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| if we will work with the Board of Education to find somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| we're not going to hire somebody off of the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| We're going to find somebody who can help if that's what the commission decides to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:26| We're going to find somebody who can assist because that's the spirit in the wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| the letter of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| And the reason I ask that is because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| you have people that are experts in different counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Sevierville and other areas and Nashville and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| I feel like you're hopefully going to get the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| But I said it last week, and I'll stand by it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| that all hands on deck, just like Kyle said, just like Commissioner Ward said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| add another tool to the tool belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Even Larson stated it, too, that I don't think that this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| And from what I've heard you say tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| you guys aren't really opposed to having more help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| Like you're not saying, no, we don't want any additional help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| You are just saying that you want to get to the end of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| and see the light at the end of the tunnel is basically what I've kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| The position of the law director's office is we do not believe that this is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| But if the commission wishes to do this and if the Board of Education wants to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| then we are at your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| I talked to Director Butte last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| and I think we all here know that he is not giving up his case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| So the school board and the parents need to know that this will be an advisory position to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2094)|
| 0:35:04| or to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| It will be advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| They will not be taking over the case because he's not going to give it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| Just keep in mind that it's an advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| It will be an advisory position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Will it help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Will it hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| We'll leave it up to the school board to decide which way they want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| but just keep in mind that it's an advisory position only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| I recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker, and obviously if anyone else wants to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| I would like to make the final comment or two as the sponsor of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| I'm glad that the resolution gives the opportunity now to the Board of Education to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| or not to hire legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| I think that's a smart idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| I had one email that came in to me earlier in the week and very heartfelt comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| And like many of you, I was like, okay, well, who's an attorney that's an expert in ADA issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| So I threw that back to this parent, and she came back with a name of somebody here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:28| But then again, the other name came from an attorney that's in Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| So in a way, that's kind of out of the question because they're not familiar with the way Tennessee law works and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| But anyways, I thought it was interesting that the attorneys that filed the suit against Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:49| Justin Gilbert, who's the lead attorney, he has his office in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| But his co-counsel, what's the second term of an attorney, co-counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Okay, co-counsel, Jessica Salonis, she's from Jackson, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| So they've found somebody still in Tennessee but not in Knox County that was able to help them initially with this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:18| And of course, as a parent of now two grown children, I was really taken by the public outcry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:29| not only what we heard tonight but what we've gotten from texts and emails and phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| And I really hate it that parents who have been big supporters of Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| have now had to remove their children from their classrooms and their friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| And if I'm looking at the numbers, we've lost five percent of our student population now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| that has gone to private schools, homeschooling, whatever, that they're not in Knox County schools anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| And that's a very disturbing number to me because that's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| So I think I'm in agreement with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I think we need to give the Board of Education the opportunity, if they wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| to hire or not hire an attorney to assist the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:22| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| I guess I just feel compelled just to speak on why we'd be voting yes for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| It doesn't mean that I agree with the judge or disagree with the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| but I do believe that people have the right to advocate for what they believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| But I do want to say this, COVID, no one asked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| No one asked for masks. We didn't know this was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| And I'm just ready for us to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| No matter what happens with this, I hope we still focus on our kids learning in a positive environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| and everyone has the opportunity to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| And let's not forget that this situation, we all have lessons that we have learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| And this exposed the inequities that happens in Knox County and the schools and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:23| I just hope that we move on from this, however it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| and make sure that we create a positive environment for all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| In an equitable environment. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Thank you. I just bring this up because Commissioner Schoonmaker and Biggs brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:47| And Ron, you may not know this if you're even still hiding over there, but is that Bob I see over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:57| Have we actually had a net loss of 5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| I know that we lose thousands of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| They withdraw for any number of reasons every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| But we have almost as many enrolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| So I would like some clarification on that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I want to talk about a number I know something about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| And it's not withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| When you look at withdrawals, like you alluded to, you have to look at enrollments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| So you have to look at a net number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| I haven't looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| What we do look at every day is our enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| And I'm just going to use a general number because I don't remember it specifically off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| Our enrollment in September was slightly over 59,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| Our enrollment today, I believe, is slightly less than 58,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| So that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Those are real numbers that we count every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| I don't say that to dispute, just merely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| Sometimes there's another side to the number that is not included in the net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Commissioner Lundy, your light is still on, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Hey, Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Can I follow up on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:38| That number, is that including dropouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| Do we have a high number of dropouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| Would that number include that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| The number includes everybody that is enrolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| And if you're dropped out, you're not enrolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Is that a high number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| I think if you look in previous years, our enrollment, it will drop off a little bit from the beginning of the year to the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2518)|
| 0:42:09| because you'll have early graduates and then we'll have the numbers get cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| And as they get cleaned up, there's usually a drop in that number rather than an increase in that number as we clean it up at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:26| So we may lose, you know, 600 or 800 throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| You generally pick it up and make it up during the enrollment in the next year, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| because of the way kids graduate and leave throughout the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| So, you know, it's a higher number than we would normally see, but it's not 5%, I don't think, of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:54| It's about 1,200, 1,300 students is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| So that's 2.5% or something like that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| But you're asking me to do math in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| Hey, Chris, could I request that information be sent to all the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| I can send you the enrollment from any particular day and the enrollment yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| We run that report every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| Do you keep track of dropouts, the kids actually drop out of school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:37| Do you keep that record, that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| That would be in their files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| It's not a number that we track every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| It's something that we roll up and aggregate at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Well, if it's easy for you to punch a button and send it out, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| I've got an email sitting in my box right now with the enrollment every day from the beginning of the school year until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| So I'd be happy to send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Commissioner Smith, did you have a clarifying question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Yes, Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| I guess my question is, you know, it's easy to get the enrollment number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| but what I'm really wondering is with the growth we've had, are those the same kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Well, I can tell you they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| How many school-age kids have moved into the Knox County area in the last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Because you also have to weigh that against what our enrollment numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| Well, that's what we were talking about with Ms. Hill's question when you talk about withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| We also have enrollments, and then you have to get to a net number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| That is not something that we look at or manage on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| Those are numbers that we can get to and massage over time, but it's not a report that we run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:57| We would have to create several reports and work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| You just mainly do the daily enrollment to send into the state, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| The daily enrollment attendance to send into the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Okay, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Mr. Boyers, I'm going to ask you a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| If you are hiring somebody specifically for a case like this, like I mentioned the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| and all the resources that they have behind them, you would not be hiring one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| You'd probably be hiring a specialist that has a law firm behind them, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| That is a reasonable assumption, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| You want the best, so you want a firm that is completely vetted in this type of litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:48| There would be no point in doing less than that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| Then you would have to have somebody that's maybe not that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| but another person to argue that case before the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| because there are certain lawyers that can argue better in front of appeals court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| Rick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2767)|

| 0:46:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2782)|

| 0:46:41| As you say, not off of a billboard, which you're talking about big bucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| and they'll sign a contract that you'll have to pay for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| even if you don't get it before the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2810)|

| 0:47:13| So that's my concern right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2836)|

| 0:47:39| The purpose of this resolution is simply for this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| to authorize the school board to ask the law director to hire outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| if the school board votes to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Not one penny of Knox County's money is going to be expended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| unless the school board votes to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| And I agree with Commissioner Durrett that the other significant elected body in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| should have that authorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-2?start=2884)|
