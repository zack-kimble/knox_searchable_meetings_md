| 0:17:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I believe that brings us to our addendum items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| And on these items, I would, again, request that we consider 90-day extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| Remember that if they need less than 90 days, they can turn things in early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| First up is Diddy Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1037)|

| 0:17:30| Well, can you give us your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Ramesh Kumar Mange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Welcome to Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Looks like you approved pending final documentation back in October of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| And you still need building, fire, and health approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| Can you tell us how you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| We have almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| After holidays, they start work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| We have to call the building, fire, and health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| So they have to check it, and good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| Because we have done with the approval from the city of Knoxville for the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| They have to do the blueprint and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| They have to approve everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| So we have the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| And after that, we have to call it and do the building, fire, and the health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| It looks like the fingerprints and background were probably done back in October of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| So it's been more than a year since the background check and fingerprint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Mr. Frost, has it been policy of this Beer Board to request new fingerprint and background if it's been more than a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| It certainly can be requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| It can't be compelled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| But likewise, it's within the Beer Board's discretion to grant an applicant additional time beyond the 90 days or past the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1129)|
| 0:18:58| So if no action is taken, then an applicant would have to start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| Would you be willing to go through your background check and fingerprints again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1145)|
| 0:19:15| Do you have a sense of how much longer it will take you to get building inspections and fire prevention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| We need the extension because we have to start the renovation in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| You have not started renovations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| After holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| You'll start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Do you have your building permit at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| We have done the contractor, and they have to pull the permit from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| And after they start the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| But they do not have the issued permit yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Oh, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Because city approved everything good to go, so we have to hire the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| And they have gone to the city, and they pull the permit, and they start work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| So you potentially need another 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| So how do we make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| You'd have to make a motion to extend the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1206)|
| 0:20:16| It's voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| The council or city of New York will need to decide how much longer the applicant's permit will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| The pending will be pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| I guess we could give you another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| Before we get a motion, let me call on the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| So I do want to bring to council's attention that there was one applicant that was over a year or close to a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1239)|
| 0:20:48| and we did require them to get re-fingerprinted and the background checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| So I'm of the opinion that I'd like to see us continue that, but, again, it's open to discussion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1252)|
| 0:21:01| My understanding from conversation with the applicant that he is willing to do a new background check and fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Are you willing to get a new background check and fingerprints again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Is there a cost to the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| There is, isn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| I guess there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| What's the cost for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| It's $3250, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| But, Mr. Frost, you're recommending that we don't attach it to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| It's voluntary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Yeah, I believe it's voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| So it's an honor system request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| There's no way to compel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Well, I mean, for sake of argument, this gentleman agreed to do it, and it was extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| Well, if he didn't get it done, well, if he was completed, then he would go to Mr. Bird, and Mr. Bird would issue the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1311)|
| 0:22:01| But I'm sure this is an honorable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| I can go ahead and make a motion for an extension of 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| I've got a motion to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Seeing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| You've got 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Next up is Lucky Shot Billiards Sports Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1351)|
| 0:22:39| Welcome to Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Kenny Harris, Lucky Shot Billiards, 6021 Chapman Highway, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| It looks like your file needs sales tax registration, building, fire, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| How are you coming along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Well, we're waiting on some stuff to be signed from the city and the state so we can pull the final permit to finish up some plumbing and some filtration systems in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1375)|
| 0:23:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| That's about all we likely have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Looks like we approved your pending file documentation back in July of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| So, like the previous applicant, it's been more than a year since your fingerprints and background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| Would you be willing to get new fingerprints and background checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| I'll move to approve or to extend the permit 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| I've got a motion to extend by 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Seeing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| That brings us to our administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| And I think we haven't had an administrative hearing in a little while, so just to review your board's options, and Mr. Frost can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1426)|
| 0:23:56| but I believe we can accept their plan, take no action, which if they have another violation with a rolling two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| they'd automatically go to a suspension revocation, or we can refer today to a suspension revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| Is that right, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| First up is Leon Enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Welcome to Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Arturo Leon, 118 North Forest Park Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee, 3793919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| And just as a reminder to the Beer Board members, at our November meeting we postponed today to give the applicant some more time to review his remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| There was a citation for sale to a minor in October of 2020, and then another one September 29th of 2021 within that two-year rolling period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1480)|
| 0:24:50| And I believe you passed out some changes to your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Yeah, very big changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| This is one of those second district ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| So I'll open it up for conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| It's Mr. Leon, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Could you highlight for us, since we just got these right before the meeting, what changes there are from the last hearing in your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| I believe last time we talked about getting the information from the Metro Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| Well, we try to be more clear with the employers, you know, more often to remind them what we're doing and to make them concerned about the problem that we have to learn from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1524)|
| 0:25:39| And every week we do a meeting, talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| And also every single server that we hire, we ask for a server permit, a liquor, and we talk to them about the orientation, how they have to work, what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1545)|
| 0:26:02| and we ask them to have the liquor by the drink permit as soon as they can, as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1562)|
| 0:26:11| Yeah, but basically nothing has changed too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| It's just to be more clear with them to do the things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| And since the last hearing in October, were you able to have a conversation with the staff from Metro Drug Coalition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| And did you get their materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| The training materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| And were able to review them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| I don't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| I don't have the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| I need to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Basically, I don't understand very well what is it, what exactly it is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| There are no more DVDs with the Metropolitan Drug Coalition, but they have a video that you can watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1611)|
| 0:27:00| There was an email that was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Yes, and there is someone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| We get the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Everybody has a class already, and that's what we did so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| We'll make sure the two of you connect after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Yeah, we talked to someone about that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Good, good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| And I'd say on the same lines as Council Member Ryder was talking, the thing that I saw that I thought was most significant about the changes was that you're now using the scanners for the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1637)|
| 0:27:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| You said there's an incentive for checking fake IDs for employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Yeah, we buy a scanner to check fake IDs just in case someone has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| But on this list here, number seven, it says, do you have an incentive program for checking IDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Do you offer employees a bonus or a gift card or some type of reward for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| We just talk more often about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| We put signs everywhere to check IDs and a few things around everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| Yeah, but we buy equipment, the little equipment, the scanners to check fake IDs just in case someone has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1689)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Okay, I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Was that yes, there's an incentive program, or no, there is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| I think I understood the scanners, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| That's what I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| So, sir, on number seven, the question is, do you have an incentive program for checking IDs and or confiscating fake IDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| On the questionnaire, you answered yes, we now do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| But you just told us that you don't have an incentive program, which means that if I'm your employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| and I find someone using a fake ID or I'm 100 percent compliant in checking IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| there's some type of bonus or gift card or some type of incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| And so if you don't have it, then this needs to be updated to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| Probably a certificate or something like that for the employer, some gift certificate for them probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| Is that what you're doing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| For employment, we can do a gift certificate for them to the employer if they ask for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| if they found someone with a fake ID or something to confiscate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| So, yes, you're doing that now, or you're going to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| No, we're doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| You just needed to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Yes, we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Also, on number six, where it asks, do you conduct in-house compliance checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| in addition to the checks conducted by APD and TABC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| You answered no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| And so under the circumstances, that's something that you all may want to consider doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| just to ensure as another safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Yeah, actually, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| That answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| On number six, your answer is yes, that you are doing in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| I don't answer somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| I don't answer very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| My English is not too good for the question, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| I don't understand very well the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| So do you guys have someone, or do you employ an outside service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| someone that's underage, to come in and try to purchase alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| But you know that that person is someone that you're not going to allow them to drink it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| but it's just another mechanism for you all to check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| and make sure that your employees are not serving underage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| and that they're checking the IDs to identify that they're underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Yeah, yeah, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| They always do that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| They check the age always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| I mean, have you ever had an underage person come in and try to purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| but you plant the person to do it just to check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| but you know that you're not going to allow them to purchase it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| No, no, obviously not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| You guys are not doing stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| I'm not sure that you're fully understanding what I'm saying, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| It sounds like no, you're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| You don't have anyone else coming in and trying to purchase it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| and you have employed them to test your employees to see if they would check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| Oh, yeah, they try, but my employers, they're very, very nice with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| because they let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| We talk about that very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Because a lot of people try to cheat them with a talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| or whatever they're trying to cheat them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| But they let me know when something like that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| and I come and talk to the person and fix the problem, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| So I think that your answer to number six is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| I had a question for the owner, but first a question for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| Just a reminder of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| When there is an infraction in a certain time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| maybe it's two within a one-year time period, then there's an automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| What is the penalty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| If there – what got this gentleman here is two in a rolling two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| If he picks up an additional one within the same period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| he goes straight to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| And, I mean, if the sale was to someone 18 years of age or younger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| just one of those and you go straight to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| And in that same time period, what do you mean by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| within that two-year time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Yes, within that two-year time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| That's one thing that I wanted to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| kind of bring up to this conversation because I have concerns comparing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| report that you submitted this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| This month you submitted a report that is essentially your remediation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| And last year, when you received the citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| you also submitted a remediation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| And it did concern me that some of the strategies that you were using were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| same as last year when you submitted your plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| the difference being now you have the scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| So it seems like that's a good addition that now you have these scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| I just wanted to encourage you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I believe as my colleagues are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| to think of other ways that you can strengthen protocols in your business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| because one concern is that if you do get another infraction within this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| two-year period, as Mr. Frost explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| you will go directly to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| And, you know, that could result in losing your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| And so we want to make sure that when you come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| we are communicating to you the severity of the situation and that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| concerned and we're looking to you to make changes so that you do not receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| another citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| That's what we're trying to prevent in this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| And so as Vice Mayor McKenzie recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| it may be good to consider some way that you can test your employees and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2089)|
| 0:34:59| if they're really checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Maybe it's a family friend who has an underage child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| I don't even know what's really appropriate, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| If others have suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| I think it's a good idea for servers to talk to each other about what they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| experienced so they can learn from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| But if we could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| maybe we could even offer some suggestions on ways other businesses have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| tried to test their employees because I think that's another step that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Yeah, that's what meetings are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| We always talk about our experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| how the people look like, how the people try to cheat us or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| Some people, the man, the father with the little one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| and they say, it's my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| I give permission to drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| and it's something that we need to talk about again and again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| And trust me, I'm so concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| I lose a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I lose a lot of time with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| And I learn more than what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| And I try to transmit that to my employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| talking again and again, once a week for sure, one hour, once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| We talk about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Hey, guys, please don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| If your friend, whoever, don't let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| If something you don't understand, you're confused or whatever, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| I'll fix it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| It's very important for us to concern for them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Before I call on Council Member Singh, who we're going to rely on next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| I just want to remind the peer board members and introduce Dr. Janetta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| Could you stand up for us real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| This is our translator, so if you turn around, you can see her there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| What I would suggest is after the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| having a meeting with Mr. Byrd and Sergeant Coward and the translator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| so that you can make sure we've clarified everything in our discussions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| I was going to ask for a translator, so thank you for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| I just wanted to make sure that things weren't lost in our communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| so this makes me feel much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Well, that was why my light was on, so I want to thank whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| because that's what we discussed in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| and so Sergeant Coward, the remediation plan, the questions, the prompts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2267)|
| 0:37:56| those are from KPD, they're from the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Are they available in other languages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Because I think we have other opportunities where it's not just Spanish or English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| I understand there's some limitations maybe, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| I don't think we have it in Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| I think that that's a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| Obviously the translator can go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| and then the other thing we brought up in the last time we discussed this in October was getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| we want you to have the training, whether it's video in your hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| or online streaming from Metro Drug Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| and then my question is, is that only in English?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| I believe that was the conversation we had in October as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Either one is just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Next time I can bring someone to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| But we have someone, and that needs to happen when we know this is an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| but I think also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| if it's a matter of us figuring out a way to help the drug coalition to come up with funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| to be able to do other languages, I think that's really needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| because this has carried on to two hearings for that one reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| and I want to make sure that we're accommodating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| All right, so our options are to take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| which means that if he has another violation within a rolling two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| then he'll automatically go to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| or we can make a motion to move him to a suspension revocation hearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| So I'll just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Council Member Saint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| I'm just responding to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Do we have the option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| What I would like to see happen is for him to have some time with MDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| with the translator, if Spanish is your language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| to be able to have these communications before, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| I guess I'm saying no action at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| but that is the action I would like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Yes, and I think that's what we just talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| is getting everyone together after the meeting to make sure there was nothing lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| Translation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| We already postponed once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Let me ask, what's the purpose of postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| Council Member Singh's comments resonate with me about wanting to have a dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| to make sure that the questions are understood well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| that we can see the responses accurately and have a good assessment of whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| I don't feel like I have a good assessment of whether the applicant fully understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| the questions and has been able to give accurate reflection of what the intent is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| and the changes made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| You could postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| I mean, well, I guess postponement is always an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| as well as the other options of accepting the plan as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| I mean, it sounds like this gentleman is willing and wanting to go meet with the MDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| or refer on to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| So, understanding that, it's really either we postpone a month to say we accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| or we do nothing, which means we accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| or we move now or in a month to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| Those are our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Those are the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Right, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Okay, I'm just trying to be clear that I understand what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| Council Member Reier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Can I ask what the impact on the business is by postponing another month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| It can still operate, so it's not an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| It's just a matter of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| My understanding was we postponed another month to make sure there was a translator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| and there is a translator available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| I guess maybe I thought there was going to be a conversation with the translator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| between October and now, so it's my understanding that that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| I mean, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I'm not aware of that occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| Okay, so it's just having somebody available tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| All right, so I'll pause for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Council Member Sands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I'm just putting my two cents in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| I would like to see a postponement because I think he should be able to have all of the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| and then be coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| So I move to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| All right, I've got a motion to postpone the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| So I don't want us to leave this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| I would not like to see him leave without being connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| and fully understanding that when he comes back, is it January, Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| that this is when we will make the decision, take the action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| It disturbs me that it was postponed previously and there was no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| as it relates to connecting with the translator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| and trying to fully understand the scope of what's going on here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| I do feel that that is part of the responsibility of the business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| because what potentially could happen is there could be another infraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| as we continue to postpone and then we're in a totally different set of circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| as it relates to the actions that can be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| But I will go ahead and support it this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| but I think going forward we as a body need to just make sure in these circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| that we ensure that the business owner knows that it's their responsibility as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| All right, I've got a motion to postpone to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| One more comment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Chair, I just would ask that you meet with our translator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| and resubmit this form as part of the next hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| If you all could make sure that you all meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Let's update this form to make sure it reflects what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Make sure we connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| We'll see you back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Next up is the Copper Cellar Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| Welcome to Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| John Woodward, 11308 Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| And it looks like you were cited for sales of a miner in June of 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2675)|

| 0:44:49| Tell us a little bit about what you're doing in your remediation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| As far as the remediation plan, really starting from day one of their employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| we review the standards and policies for identifying guests we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| serve alcohol to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| And then throughout their day-to-day, shift-to-shift, pre-shift rallies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| postings around the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| encourage them to ID correctly and make smart decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| That being said, part of the remediation plan that we've submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| the things that we have done differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| we do post the born-on-date for service on all of our point-of-sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| terminals, so it's right in front of them every time they ring in an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| We also have added a sign-in sheet at the beginning of their shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| Each shift, every time somebody comes on for service, we review that with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2751)|
| 0:45:59| and they sign off on a form with the date that they understand what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| Since furthering that same point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| we are also requiring all of our employees to check an ID that is either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| vertical or with the identifying red stripe on it to bring it to a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2776)|
| 0:46:23| to be verified in addition to table side, regardless of their age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| We have also added a function to our point-of-sale terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2791)|
| 0:46:39| I don't know if you'll be able to see it from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| but we've added a function on there where they can, at any point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| touch that button, and it will print out a chip of the born-on-date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| and what they need to be doing to make sure that they're serving responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| That is also part of their pre-shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| When they do their sign-in sheets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| I've got a pretty sizable stack of them from the last month and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| since I met Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| We require them to do that at pre-shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| When they sign in before they take a table, they print that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| They have it in their server book as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| We have tried to facilitate an atmosphere where it's as visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| and as frequent as it can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| try to make it as efficient as possible for them to be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| Thanks for that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| I'll open it up for any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| The example you just gave, is that one time before they start their shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| or is it for every new customer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| It is every shift, not per customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| We'll gather at 10.15, 10.30 in the morning before we open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| and review all of this information, review the born-on-date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| They'll go to start their shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| They'll punch in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| When they punch in, they'll have that button available right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| on their first screen when they punch in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| They'll hit that button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| It'll print out a chip with the born-on-date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| for them to put in their server book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| It's another level of protection that we're trying to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| So is this where you, question six, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| do you conduct in-house compliance checks in addition to the checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| conducted by KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| It says yes, and then I think it describes something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| that you just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Is that the policy that is a reference to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Yeah, you're pretty spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| I guess my challenge, and we get to see a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| You don't get to see as many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| So just for broader context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| one of the things that keeps coming back to me is that reminders for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| employees at the shift, at staff meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| are the minimum, I think, required for serving alcohol and being safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| This is a personal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| but the next tier up from that are some of these systemic things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| the scanners, incentive programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| the in-house secret shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| All those three things to me particularly are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| in addition to just reminders, because you know better than the rest of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| you have turnover, and so reminders help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| Those are things that we're in the process of finding a way to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| with some financial responsibility over the scope of the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2978)|
| 0:49:46| We're looking at different avenues as far as ID scanners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| and how it could be practical for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| So that is something that we're still looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| My brief experience, more employee check-ins don't always do the trick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| A suggestion is that it's worth the investment to not be back for the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| More reminders of the same people or new people is not extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3014)|
| 0:50:24| To that point a little bit, in both of these instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| we have gotten the ID and looked at the ID and just done the math wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| Both of the guys involved with both of those situations are good guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| They made an honest mistake, which is why we've made it mandatory for any ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| that is either vertical or has the red stripe to indicate they're under 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| that that opinion is taken completely from them and put on the leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| Look closer is not necessarily something that I've seen work for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| So I just encourage you to make the investment in some of these other extraordinary measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| that I think will have a better effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| Absolutely. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| I've got other members who want to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| I just want to remind the beer board of the time and that we have to adjourn at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| So if we've got a lot of questions still that we'd like to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| we could always postpone into January and move on to the last agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| because I want to make sure you have time to take a break before council starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| You want to keep going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Okay. I think Council Member Parker was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3105)|
| 0:51:54| Can you help me understand why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| if you're having the same issue with why the underage person is being served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3119)|
| 0:52:07| there hasn't been an investment yet in scanners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| That's something that if we're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| it's over a larger scale than just putting them into one restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| and at the size of our restaurants would require multiple scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| We are a family restaurant and allow all ages in the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| So to scan every ID, no different than scanning a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| If somebody is paying for a tab, we would need multiple scanners for every location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| which is a sizable investment in finding a product that will do that efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| To the scale that we would need to do it is something we're still actively looking at, that solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3166)|
| 0:52:56| It strikes me that we have had smaller businesses able to make that commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3176)|
| 0:53:05| and we were pretty hard on the previous business with a similar issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3185)|
| 0:53:12| but they've at least taken that step to invest in the scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3192)|
| 0:53:22| I know that we're running out of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| but I would hate for us to not take this matter as seriously as we did the previous matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| I'll pause so that my other colleagues can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| I assume what you mean by other restaurants is all the Calhoun's, anything associated with Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| How many restaurants is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Twenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Twenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| And this is one of the restaurants that got cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| One of the restaurants, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| So our options are—Council Member Singh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Our options here are to take no action, which if they get another finding in the rolling two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| then they'll automatically go to a suspension replication hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| or we can refer them to a suspension replication hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| So what I'll do is just pause for a minute and see if we have any more comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| or if anyone wants to make any motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3266)|

| 0:54:31| I have many of the same concerns as Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| that if a small restaurant can get a scanner and get that working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| I'm of the mind to postpone 30 days and see what you guys can do about getting scanners in at least that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3287)|

| 0:54:57| Council Member Ryder, you had a line on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| I've got any discussion about postponing for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3305)|

| 0:55:15| Chairman Roberto, can I tack on one comment for them since you're coming back in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| One of the things that you answered no to was the Metro Drug Commission's training materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| The January meeting, could you look into that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| We were of the understanding the DVDs were unavailable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| If there's an alternative to that, we'll absolutely take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3342)|

| 0:55:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| It is just not available as a physical DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| All right, next up is FSC LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3351)|

| 0:56:12| Mr. Frost, can you talk to us a little bit about the scheduling and whether or not any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| deadlines were missed in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Yes, sir, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Section 4-78 lays out the requirements within which a revised remedial plan must be received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| and the fine paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| It's five business days prior to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| It was missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| It was filed late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| According to Mr. Johnson, the law department, as required by the ordinance, has filed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| noncompliance complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| So, they will be going to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| So, independent of any action this board takes tonight, they're going to be going to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| I was just going to say, if that's already in line, could we just go ahead and make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| motion to refer for revocation hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| I'd like to make a motion for revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| They're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| I've got a motion to go to the revocation hearing, suspension hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Last up, discussion of penalty structure for underage sales and violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| We've seen a disturbing trend over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| In 2019, of the inspections that were done, we saw 13.7 percent sold to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3456)|
| 0:57:46| That was 38 out of 128.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| In 2020, we saw 15.4 sell to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| That was 13 out of 84.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| And in 2021, we saw 29.6 percent sell to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| That was 26 violations out of 189 inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| In 2019, we had two violations in a rolling two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| In 2020, we moved to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| And in 2021, we moved to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| Also, in 2021, we had one third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| I'm sure all the members of the beer board are as concerned about these statistics as I've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| I've been in communication with Sergeant Coward, Mr. Bird about these, as well as Mr. Frost at the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| Although I don't have very much time to go over it, I'm going to recommend that we make some changes to the penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3507)|
| 0:58:34| Right now, the first offense would be no penalty if you submit a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3514)|
| 0:58:44| What I would recommend is that we move to a $1,000 penalty on first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| And if you submit your remedial plan within 20 days, it goes to $500 with an option to appeal to the beer board within 30 days to contest that violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3529)|
| 0:58:58| Second offense, $1,500 penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| Violator must turn in their remedial plan and appear before the administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| Third offense, violator goes straight to the administrative hearing before penalty with referral for penalty up to $2,500 or revocation of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3547)|
| 0:59:18| I think these are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| We talked about at the beginning of this term of beer board that we were going to be data driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| We were going to be intentional about what we were doing, and I think this data is shocking and it needs a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| I also want us to be transparent, and that's why I'm not going to bring this up until January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| so there's plenty of time for everyone watching and listening today and us to get information out about making any possible changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3578)|
| 0:59:46| That would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| With one minute to go, anyone want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| Do we need to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| There's no motion necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| I'm just going to coordinate with Mr. Frost and the law department, and I'll bring something to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| There's no more business in front of beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211214?start=3603)|
