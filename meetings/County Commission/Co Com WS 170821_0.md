| 0:01:21| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| You have heard the response to calling the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| Six members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| That is a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| We are here today for public input related to paintball, airsoft, zoning regulations in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=90)|
| 0:01:43| Is there persons of the public here wishing to speak to the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=103)|
| 0:01:54| Counselor, could I have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| I speak on behalf of Sam Harabi, and he is very much in favor of the proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| which will be, I think, on second reading at this upcoming commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=129)|
| 0:02:18| Are there questions of the person giving statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=138)|
| 0:02:27| Seeing no questions, thank you, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Mr. Green, do you wish to make a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| You have entered into public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| Gerald Green, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Just a quick statement that the need for this ordinance amendment was brought to MPC by the owner of an existing airsoft facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=163)|
| 0:02:53| who wanted to expand and provide outdoor facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Staff worked with that individual and with Mr. Seymour to draft the proposed regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=176)|
| 0:03:04| which would define airsoft, make it a use on review in the agricultural district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| and establish certain standards for the operation of the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| The facilities would be reviewed and approved by MPC at their regular meetings following a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| And MPC has the authority, as stated in the proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| to allow certain changes in the basic standards for airsoft and paintball ranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| while assuring that they're safe and do not have adverse impacts on neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=212)|
| 0:03:43| Commissioner Daley, do you wish to ask a question of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| No, of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Oh, that's a question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| I just wondered if we're approving or changing this first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| Is that okay at the second reading in a month, or do we have to do two readings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| If you deem it a substantial change, if this body deems it to be a substantial change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| then you will be back at first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| It's kind of up to you all's interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| If we felt that it was a real substantial change, we would bring it to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| But everything is a policy decision based upon this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| If I may add, Mr. Chairman, the change that is proposed is just a very basic one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| which clarifies that the planning commission does have the authority to approve a very minimal standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=279)|
| 0:04:51| and the buffering required for the airsoft and paintball ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| It was in the text, but it was not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| And this just makes it clear that the planning commission does have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| Continuing, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Mr. Green, I believe that this one here and Mr. Seymour, this was an inside airsoft, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| So this really is going to not deal with this one, but it will deal with the ones that are outside in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| I have no problem with the 200, with the fence myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| It will deal with inside and outside airsoft courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| and it will require use on review or review by the planning commission for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=325)|
| 0:05:33| And the standard dealt with an outside airsoft as far as a net protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| and just clarified that the planning commission could work within the parameters to reduce that some amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=339)|
| 0:05:51| And to address then your question and the law department's response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| there is not significant enough change to warrant this being referred to as first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| We will be proceeding with second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| Are there other questions of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| Is there public available to give input on the paintball airsoft range ordinance zoning revisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=371)|
| 0:06:25| Seeing no one else making public comment, we will stand in brief recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| to be recalled at the sound of the gavel or 340.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| We will be back at 340.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=397)|
| 0:06:47| You go to 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| Well, I think this was at 330.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| 345 would give the public 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| That would be more than reasonable to let anybody that's not here show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| but they were on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| They've had a reasonable amount to make arrangements to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| I'd give them whatever you thought was worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| Okay, let me rephrase my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| We will be in brief recess until 350 or the sound of the gavel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| We are in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| I would just request that everyone just remain where you're standing because I need to make the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=448)|
| 0:07:39| Is there anyone present wishing to make public input on the paintball airsoft range ordinance change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=459)|
| 0:07:54| Seeing none, this public hearing is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=474)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=492)|

| 0:08:33| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| Seven members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| The purpose of this meeting today is to receive a presentation, an overview, from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=521)|
| 0:08:52| I would like to recognize that the Chair of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, Miss Rebecca Longmeyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| is here with us this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Also, Miss Laura Cole is a member of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, and you'll have to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=542)|

| 0:09:21| Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Also a member of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| And as we sometimes observe, Mr. Kelly is also here with us this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| and the purpose of this is as a result of a conversation that the Director of MPC, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=572)|
| 0:09:42| has had with me a couple of months ago stating that he would like to have a few minutes to talk one-on-one with Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| to give a brief, in his words, look at the responsibilities and actions of the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=589)|
| 0:10:01| and to be able to have a few minutes to respond to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| I have also asked that he not run too far over past 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| because we would like to have a small break before we get into our work session later on this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| Having said that, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| I've got a brief PowerPoint presentation that I'll go through that provides an overview of the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| and procedures of MPC, especially with regard to how they relate to the work that comes to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=631)|
| 0:10:39| from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| First, just some general overview of what is planning and who does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| Planning is that broad view and look at how the county will grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| and how to manage that growth through the approval of development standards for development that occurs in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| Under state law, MPC was created as the Regional Planning Commission in 1956.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| Upon the creation of the Planning Commission and the adoption of the zoning ordinance by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| MPC was charged with the administration and enforcement of that zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| The Planning Commission makes recommendations on a number of different items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| from text changes to map changes to review of various items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| Many of these come before this board for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| The Knox County Commission is the chief legislative body for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| It's charged with the adoption of all ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| Map changes and text changes to the zoning are ordinances and, therefore, must be approved by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| The Board of Zoning Appeals is charged with granting variances or deviations from the standards set forth in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=703)|
| 0:11:52| That board also hears certain appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| And who is the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| The MPC is composed of 15 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Eight of them are appointed by the Knox County Mayor, seven by the City of Knoxville Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| They serve four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| They're limited to two consecutive terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| They are not paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| They are assisted by the MPC staff, which is now divided into four divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| The Planning Services Division, which handles all development review, comprehensive plans, sector plans, ordinance amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=737)|

| 0:12:30| The Information Services does our mapping, all the maps that are prepared for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| also assists the county school board with mapping, other agencies with mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| They keep the website up to date, provide special reports, development activity in Knox County, an annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| demographic information, working with the Census Bureau and others, and our Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| Unlike the rest of the MPC staff, the Transportation Planning staff works for the portions of five counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=776)|
| 0:13:07| and the municipalities in those within the Transportation Planning Region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| That's Sevierville, parts of Sevier County, Maryville-Alcoa, parts of Blount County, City of Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| parts of Anderson and Roan Counties, as well as Knoxville, Farragut, and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| doing all the transportation planning, whether vehicular, bike, or pedestrian for those local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=804)|
| 0:13:34| Now we'll get into the items that come before you most often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Those are the ordinance or text amendments, map amendments, use on review, and we'll go over subdivisions to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=818)|
| 0:13:46| The text amendments are what you just had the public hearing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Those are changes to the wording in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| They are updates, not quite yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| My assistant is getting ahead of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| She wants to make sure you have the break at the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| Those text amendments are initiated by the County Commission, the Planning Commission, members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| or they may be identified in an adopted plan or policy document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| that instructs the staff to undertake those drafting of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| They're drafted by the MPC staff with input from county departments and often from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| They're reviewed by the Planning Commission at a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| The Planning Commission makes recommendations with regard to those text amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| and may recommend revisions or changes to them as part of that public review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| Following a recommendation by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| they're brought to this commission for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| There is a public hearing, and there may be further revisions based on input from the county law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| the public, or from the commissioners themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Upon adoption, they become part of the zoning ordinance and are enforced by the county staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| and are regulatory for any development that falls under the purview of that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=902)|
| 0:15:11| The MAP amendments are those that you see most often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| They are rezonings, basically rezonings is another name for the MAP amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| They change the land use designation of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| and by doing that, that change in the land use designation may permit different uses of the property or a more intense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| Some of the rezonings that come before you often are possibly from an agricultural zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| to a planned residential where you not only change the zoning designation of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| but more importantly change the intensity of the use or the number of dwelling units permitted on a particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| Those MAP amendments can be initiated by the property owner or their representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| by the county commission, or by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| The requests are reviewed by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| The sector plans guide the staff recommendation, as does the growth policy plan that we'll talk about in a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=963)|
| 0:16:12| As part of the review of those requests, staff evaluates the impact of the potential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| that would be permitted with a MAP amendment on the surrounding uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| Also, we assess the infrastructure ability to accommodate the change in intensity of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| and any limitations placed on the property by natural features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| And as you realize, we often look at the recommended density that's set forth in the hillside development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=993)|
| 0:16:41| or hillside protection ordinance to determine what the density of a property may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| and make a recommendation based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| You have some, I brought you some handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| Mr. Anders, Commissioner Anders, if you weren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1015)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| I'm not going to try to read these from the PowerPoint, but I think that may be useful for you in seeing the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| This talks about how the sector plan is developed and keeping in mind that often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| when there's a zoning request or MAP amendment before you, we have to change the sector plan also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| Some of the conditions for changing a sector plan designation include additional development in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| that changes the character of the area, infrastructure improvements or mistake or oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| and the initial land use designation applied to the property as part of the sector planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| There's also the rezoning process, and a rezoning request, again, is evaluated by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| Not only MPC staff, we receive input from other staff, primarily the Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| We review the request, notify the public, review it before the planning commission at a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| and that recommendation comes before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| If the planning commission recommends denial, that denial is final unless it's appealed to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1093)|
| 0:18:22| for the first level of appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| Use on review, there's an approval required for certain uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Those are uses that are identified in planned districts, again, the planned residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| all the development subdivision residential development and planned residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| is a use on review and is approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| There are certain uses that are identified in the zoning ordinance as needing a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| Again, referring back to the public hearing you had earlier, the Airsoft paintball facilities would be a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| and any development plan for those uses would have to be reviewed and approved by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| prior to issuance of development permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| And there are certain other cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| There are some cases where the planning commission may approve a rezoning and designate that any development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| in that rezoning of that property would be a use on review, placing a condition on that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| Again, the planning commission is charged with the approval of use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| The staff reviews and makes a recommendation to the planning commission with regard to use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| In some cases, there are specific standards for the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| Again, the Airsoft paintball ordinance before you has certain standards for buffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| for size of development, et cetera, that are specific standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| In other cases, there are general standards that are in place for uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Among those are that it be compliant with any adopted plan or policy in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| The appeals for a use on review determination by the planning commission goes to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1202)|
| 0:20:12| This, again, you have a flowchart for the use on review that lays it out a bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| This board does not see subdivision, but it's an integral part of a lot of the work you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| in establishing the planned residential density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| The next step in those planned residential districts is often a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| There are three levels or three steps in a subdivision approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| the concept plan, the design plan, and the final plan for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| The planning commission is authorized by the subdivision regulations and state statutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| to review and approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| The concept plan lays out the general plan for development of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| identifying the road layout, the lot layout, and sometimes the location of utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| although utilities are generally addressed in the design plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| In the subdivision, the concept plan is reviewed at a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| There is notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Following approval of the concept plan, the design plan is presented to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| It's a staff-level review at the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| The design plan sets forth the detailed engineering drawings for the streets, utilities, stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| and drainage system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| It must adhere to the approved concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| Upon approval of the design plan, construction permits can be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| for the construction of the infrastructure, the streets, the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| the stormwater and drainage system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Upon completion of that infrastructure, the final plan is presented for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| The final plan is approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| The subdivision process is largely a technical process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| The standards are set forth in the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| and in the engineering standards of the county for the development of a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| If a subdivision complies with those standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| there is not much room for the planning commission to deny approval of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1343)|
| 0:22:31| You have a flow chart that lays that out for your reference later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| The growth policy plan is probably one of the most controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| and restrictive guiding policies that the county has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| It was developed in 2000 by the city of Knoxville, the town of Farragut, and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| and adopted in 2001 by all those entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| The goal of the plan was to provide a guide for growth and development for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| It identifies three land development categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| The planned growth area, which was to accommodate the development of urban areas for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| I'm sorry, the urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| The planned growth area was to accommodate the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| and growth of unincorporated areas for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| and the rural area was identified as land to be preserved for open space, farming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| recreation, and other non-urban activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| The plan has not been updated or amended since its adoption 16 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| And this map lays out the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| The gray are the incorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Blue is the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| The sort of light yellow beige is the planned growth area, and the green is the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| And there are some mandates set forth in the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| and they guide the zoning and the intensity of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| that is recommended by the planning staff and the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| The zoning must be in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| In the rural area, the zoning must be agricultural, low-density residential, or limited commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| Within that rural area, the commercial development is limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| with the neighborhood commercial limited to a 5,000-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| There's no industrial or manufacturing uses permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Residential density is also limited in the rural areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| with a residential density limited to two units per acre or three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| if it's an expansion of the planned growth area and utilities are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| And NPC staff recommendations are guided by those limitations set forth in the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1494)|
| 0:25:04| That's my quick presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| I'd be happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| And again, Mr. Kelly is here to help me answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| and also some of the planning commission members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| First, I would like to call on the members of the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| If any of those, especially since you've traveled to be here with us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| would you like to make comments of your work in NPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you, Ms. Longmeyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Mr. Anders, I'm Rebecca Longmeyer, chair of NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| I'm actually serving my third four-year term because I got appointed before the agreement for only two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| But when I joined NPC, I was unaware of the impact of the decisions of NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| Knox County is a very fast-growing, fast-changing place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| Many of you, especially those of you in the West Knox County area or the Powell-Karnes area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| houses are mushrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| They spring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| One of the biggest things we deal with is the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| Will the roads, will the water, will the sewers handle what the developers want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| And I'll tell you right now, the roads won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| We don't have enough money to fix all the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| I will tell people, though, that the better you fix your roads, the wider they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| the more cars are going to be on them and they will go faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| So a small road is actually a benefit for many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| There have been questions about why we don't use Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| We use Bob's Rules of Order, which is a more lenient way of dealing with procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| Robert's Rules limits people to one time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| If you've ever been to one of the commission meetings, the NPC commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| you'll see that there are a group of people with many different ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| We have developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| We have people who are really interested in preserving agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| We have a wide variety of thought, and they all are very vocal about what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| But it is a very civil organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| They don't talk over each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| They listen to each other in order to get the best decision possible that we will send to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| or to help the community grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| And I'll be glad to answer any questions if you have any of those also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Ms. Cole and Mr. Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| I want to talk a little bit about the growth policy plan because that's kind of been the thorn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| in the last three or four meetings for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| So it was adopted by three different governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| If one government resoluted to pull out of that, does it null and void that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| The original resolution, it was mediated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| That resolution is presented to all three of the bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| and all three of the bodies set additional changes to the mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| That resolution was sent and passed by, my understanding, all three bodies at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| And that resolution was a sunset date of December 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| And that's where your advice came through the other day when is it enforceable or not enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| The question before the Attorney General is what effect does the non-forced annexation have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| on the growth policy plan because there are some growth policy plans that are enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| If it is still enforced and we want to update or deal with, there's processes to do that with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| That's all we were saying at the time the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| And so we couldn't just have a resolution of this commission to withdraw from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| I think you can after seven, how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Three years was the way that it required a three-year state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| It's so vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| It's terribly vague to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| You can't imagine a lawyer doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| Well, you've got to consider that this was something where the legislature was trying to appease TML| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1757)|
| 0:29:26| because of the Victor annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| But the bottom line is it had to be in effect for three years, mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| Then it said you will meet after that to make changes because you can't tie up 20 years there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| But the key to what we have is the agreement with the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| separate agreement with the town or the city of Knoxville was it expired December 31, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| That says that within that resolution and that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| And so my opinion is you don't have a valid agreement going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| Now, if you want to reinstitute the growth policy committee under the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| and come up with a new one, you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| But it's our opinion right now that that thing is expired in December 31, 2007 of its own terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1812)|
| 0:30:21| And so I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| And with the new state law of forced annexation, or no longer forced annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| I think that cured what the problem was then anyway, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| that the new law cures the forced annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| And so do we need a growth policy plan anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Because we can do better, especially in my part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| we can do better than what the growth policy plan calls for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| because we can't cluster anything with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| That's currently the question before the state AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| And they've called me on it and said that it's very complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| and it will take them a while to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| And so, you know, basically be kind and patient and we'll get you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| But that only deals with the issue of the forced annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| That's what they were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| So we're still saying that some people can only get so many per acre per this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| Is that valid anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| No, that's not what we were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| We were saying that the policy in which we have been operating under as a guideline expired in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| And the challenge for MPC is that we've worked for both the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| Our attorney, MPC's attorney, has advised us that the growth policy plan is still effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| and the city of Knoxville's legal staff have advised us that it's still effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| It doesn't affect the city of Knoxville any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| It has zero effect on the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| So how can that be unenforceable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| They state their party to the agreement and their understanding that agreement is still effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| I'm still waiting, as the county law director is, for an opinion from the attorney general's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Well, let's just agree to disagree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| We'll agree to disagree with your attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| I'm just stating that we have several masters we have to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| I've got to get one more question, if I can, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| There's been a lot of push to make as much as we can plan residential by the MPC staff and by request of you and your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1960)|
| 0:32:56| A development that I wish I could think of the location, but there was a development that was placed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| and they said we can't approve it at such and such per acre or medium density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| but we'll give you planned residential, which is adding a lot of cost on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| and also seems to me those instances where we're forcing planned residential onto folks that are not applying for planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=1993)|
| 0:33:25| and almost saying you can have this but not this, it seems a little coercive in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| It's also more expensive and it also justifies the staff's reason for being there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| If you get the more planned residential, the more reviews you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| Why is that push taking place on certain developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| I was not aware there was a push going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| What would trigger that, you can't have this but you can have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| What would trigger that in your decision making process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| We look at the sector plan designations most importantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| We look at the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| We look at the infrastructure and try to come up with a, and actually also look at the hillside protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| and come up with what we feel is a density that can be accommodated by the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| and recommend that a request in that density range be presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| So if you've got a hillside that you want to try to protect and you can give them four an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| but you can't control where they put that four an acre, you're trying to do planned residential to approve that plot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| And allow them the flexibility of moving the density off the steeper slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| What's the reason and the cost difference on the applications and all that stuff for planned residential versus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| is it because there's more reviews or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| The only additional would be the concept plan and that's required for a subdivision anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| I want to go back to what you said about having many masters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| And I struggle with the concept of the city having basically jurisdiction over land that they don't have jurisdiction over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2114)|
| 0:35:22| That they're able to control our development outside their city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| Does that seem reasonable to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| I will state that's the way the planning commission is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| And the city sometimes has the opposite view that there are eight county appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| and the county appointees have the majority, represent the majority of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| I will state from a planning standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| what happens in one jurisdiction does have an impact on the other jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| And unlike county residents, those who live in the city pay taxes to both entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| and support growth and infrastructure, whether it's in the city limit or the county, outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2163)|
| 0:36:19| Are there other questions or comments by any of the other of my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2179)|
| 0:36:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Just kind of a brief update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| How is the new sign program going to notify residents that there's a rezoning or a plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2199)|
| 0:36:46| I'll answer to some extent and Mr. Kelly may answer more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| What we've heard so far is positive that the public can tell by the color what the request is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| The signs are more noticeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| As far as I know, we've had no complaints from the development community about having to post the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| Do you have anything to add, Ed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| I think what you're getting a lot of is people will immediately leave the office and go out and post their sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| so that you're probably getting a longer posting period than you would had we been the ones to put them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| The only issue that we've had is to institutionalize the process in our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| and we have on occasion not given them the sign to walk out the door with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| but we do have a way to check and balance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| We know, so we have gone out and had to put up two or three signs ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| because we didn't hand them a sign when they walked out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| But we are just 40 years of practice of not giving somebody a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| Yeah, you've got to give them a sign now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| But we're overcoming that pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| People don't like having to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Okay, and then on this past month's agenda where the developer, contractor signs the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| and then they have to have the date posted by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| On some of the documents it said, I think it was July 22nd, 24th, somewhere in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| But on one of the filings it actually said you need to have it posted on the August 10th meeting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2295)|
| 0:38:24| Well, that was incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| If I could see that, I'd know who did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| So we'd certainly have a chat with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I'll send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Commissioner Gill, you had your light on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| This is for Rebecca Longmeyer who was chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| She indicated that she, are you term limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| Explain your first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| I was appointed first by Mayor Ragsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| and then reappointed for four years by Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| During that time period, an agreement was signed by the city and county that there would be a two-term limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| So that would be eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| So Mayor Burchett, when he reappointed me, said as far as he was concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| the term limit began when that agreement was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| So my term ends next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| So, yes, it is a two-term limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| But I would like to point out that a city resident is a citizen of both the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| So that person might be appointed by either the city or county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| I am a resident of the county, but I don't know if the city mayor can appoint a county person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| It's really difficult, and I know you all have come into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| when you're dealing with these two governmental entities and who gets to do what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| But, yes, my term should be ended next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| And I do want to tell you, once we're reappointed, it has to go to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| And sometimes that takes a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| Following up on the signs, I do wish that you would put in the verbiage that the signs need to be picked up no later than a week after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2400)|
| 0:40:10| Because I still have a yellow sign from three months ago that's still sitting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| and that's trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| We have added that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| Have you? I hadn't seen it in this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Are there other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| Seeing none, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2432)|
| 0:40:45| I called it for 11 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| It looks like I could say it one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2452)|
| 0:40:59| We will open today's meeting, the work session of Knox County Commission for the month of August, with a Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2459)|
| 0:41:11| Commissioner Gill, could I please call on you to lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Yes, please stand and salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2486)|
| 0:41:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| Thank you, Commissioner Gill, and if there are roll call votes in either this meeting or next Monday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2503)|
| 0:41:53| Commissioner Gill, you will be called upon first to cast a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2520)|

| 0:42:19| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| The next item is to amend and approve the agenda, normally a two-step operation in the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2546)|
| 0:42:35| Amendments to the agenda, I've been given Resolution 905 by the Property Assessor's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2555)|
| 0:42:45| which is to give us a certified tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| I've also been given Resolution 906, Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| a resolution in reference to the University of Tennessee Outsourcing Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| Are there other items to be added to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| Are there items to be withdrawn from the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| Are there items to be deferred on today's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| For the purpose of this motion, do I hear a motion that all be added, removed, or deferred be set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2603)|
| 0:43:35| Seeing no further discussion, that motion is properly before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| that all be added, withdrawn, or deferred is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| Next, I'm working on a motion for us to arrive at a consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2631)|
| 0:44:03| I would say that we will discuss the Property Assessor's Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| We will discuss Commissioner Gill's Resolution 906, those two that have been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2651)|
| 0:44:20| I would also like for us to look at five other items that are on today's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| and not be on consent but be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Let me begin with item number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| It's on page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| It's Resolution 218, related to recognition of Representative Brooks' contributions to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2677)|
| 0:44:48| Moving on to number 36, page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2688)|

| 0:45:14| It's grade crossings of street crossings and railroad grade crossings here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2714)|

| 0:45:50| The next one there, item 69, also page 11, that's Resolution 801,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2750)|

| 0:46:09| committing and appropriating of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| Those items we will discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Are there other items, my fellow Commissioners, that you would like to see discussed today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2776)|

| 0:46:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| Some of these I just want some clarity on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| but I would like to talk to number 8201, item number 11204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| Hold on, hold on, let's back up here for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| We'll try to write these down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Which was the first item number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2823)|

| 0:47:22| Item 11 on page, Resolution 204, continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2842)|

| 0:48:12| 67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| That's 603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| 603, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2895)|
| 0:48:24| Is that the list there, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=2906)|

| 0:51:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3107)|

| 0:52:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| On page 2, item number 8 is consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| to approve an agreement with Act Aspire LLC for the provision of periodic assessments for grades 6 through 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| at a cost of $14,580, Resolution 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| No, that's mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Commissioner Besseler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| I just need someone from the school system to tell me what this Act Aspire is and what it's going to do for the 6th through 8th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3147)|
| 0:52:40| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| I thought it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| Do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| That's why I didn't add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| Thank you, Dr. Roswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Okay, the Act Aspire is actually an ACT benchmark test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3187)|
| 0:53:16| So what it does is the ACT is just a test that's given once a year to tell students where they come out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| So this is actually one that will allow students to take four benchmark tests a year so that teachers can get immediate feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| and then work on those deficient areas prior to taking the real ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| So what this does is 11 of our 14 middle schools are going to pilot that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| It's a relatively new test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| We used to do the plan test for sophomores and the explore test for 8th graders that were both precursors to the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| It kind of gave us a projected score for how they would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| Those tests have gone away and they've replaced it with the ACT Aspire test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| So in those, we let each school kind of pick to see what they think, what grade level will be best served for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| So grades 6, 7, and 8 will be the ones they'll be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| And they'll have four benchmark tests and also teachers will have access to like 10 quizzes to look at specific skills for the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3246)|
| 0:54:14| So it's getting them ready for the high school ACT test, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| Correct, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| And we've done it again in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| We've used the explore test that was ACT's old test for the same kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| This is just their newer product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is promptly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Item number 11 is consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| approving a host contract with Marzino Research, LLC for the provision of seven days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| of on-site training regarding personalized competency-based education at Vine Magnet Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| at a cost of $42,000, resolution 204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| I need to find out about this kind of test too and what is the purpose and what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| goal for that test, testing or research training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you, Dr. Risely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Thank you, Chairman Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| So this is actually, this one is a no-cost to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| We worked on competency-based instruction as kind of a newer idea that allows students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| to move kind of as they show mastery as opposed to everybody learning the same thing all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| So both Austin East and Vine were involved in a pilot that was funded by the state last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| year to look at this competency-based or mastery-based instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| And the work that was done at Vine Magnet with four teachers was actually, the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| really liked the work that was done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| So again, so you may have a classroom of 25 students, some master that really quick and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| so they're able to dive deeper in, but you're kind of allowed to have other students who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| might need more time to master that work through that content at that given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| So again, the state was, that was set to run out, but the state was impressed with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| work done at Vine and made this grant available to them to continue one more year of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3382)|

| 0:57:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| The reason for me asking that this be reviewed is because I want to make my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| aware of the fact that Representative Brooks will be here at the stated meeting, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| will recognize him again at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3443)|

| 0:58:52| The Sheriff's Department will not be here today, but this grant is basically a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| that we've had for several years now, and it's basically for police equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| There will be a MOU between us and the City of Knoxville and a few others to where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| buy certain equipment, and it's a litany of things, and so I don't know what's on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| agenda to purchase this year, but I'm trying to think of what's been purchased in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| and we've done some technology improvements and things of that nature, certain types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=3555)|

| 1:08:12| designating, committing, and appropriating funds in the total amount of $166,794.79| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4092)|
| 1:08:20| for the fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018 for various funds and departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| Seeing no discussion, oh, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| Do you want to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Mr. Connelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Let me get off the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| Mr. Connelly, I got three here, maybe four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| Magistrate retiring, can you use that unpaid vacation leave, or what is that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4131)|
| 1:08:59| Page, juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| Yeah, they have a magistrate retiring early, so they have to fill a spot for training purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4143)|
| 1:09:11| and be a one-time deal, and so Judge Irwin asked for that to be put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| and so that was part of their designation request for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| So it's basically letting them have two magistrates at one time for a training purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| Republic Plastics, $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| What is that one for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Which one, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| Republic Plastics under non-departmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| Sure, so this would be an amount that we would pay to county IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| It is a project out at Forks of the River that we will improve stormwater drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4181)|
| 1:09:49| and some road improvements as well that will allow that company to expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| and so we'll be doing the road work, and that will be paid through county IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| Do you know which property it is, the big building or the one in front near the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| Do you know a chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| You know it's not necessary, but they own two or three buildings in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| I don't know right off which it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| Cardew, new entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| Sure, so that actually will be paid to the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| We have a couple of projects where we're jointly doing road work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| and so what this is doing is helping with the revision of Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| So the city asked for our help in that project, and we're going to commit $125,000 for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| and likewise we've asked for their help on some other projects where they're doing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| All of them for street projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| And then the last one for Visit Knoxville Film Office funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| What this is for is coming out of the motel fund is we give them so much a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4253)|
| 1:11:03| along with the City of Knoxville, for them to go out and recruit films to be done here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| and I think it's really good for our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| It's an economic driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| The last one that was done that we know about, which has been more since then, was the Burt Reynolds film,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| and I think it's coming out soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| So that is an economic development tool that we use through Visit Knoxville for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| I didn't know if it was for that or if it was for the commercial for the bike race that was produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| I guess that was Visit Knoxville or whatever, but it was awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| Yeah, this would be just for film.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| Yeah, I can congratulate them on whoever did that commercial where they start off with the bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| Devil's Track, it was an awesome commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Mr. Daley, can I ask a follow-up to that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| Is this pass-through dollars then from the hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| or is this in addition to what Visit Knoxville receives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| It would be in addition to what they are budgeted to receive in the FY18 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| And how much did their budget increase this past year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| By code, they get 40% of hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| and I think that number for hotel-motel tax went to $8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| so they get 40% of $8 million, so $3.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| It was an $800,000 increase, I think, from $7.2 to $8 or from $7.3 to $8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| so they got 80% of $700,000, 40% of $700,000, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| Okay, so this is in addition to the $800,000 increase they got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Continuing, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Are some of these pass-through dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| or are these actually tax dollars that are earmarked for these different entities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| For the most part, I think they're all going to be just earmarked for certain entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| So like the Great Schools Partnership, the $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| That is one that would be a pass-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| They will take that money and pay it straight to Tennessee Achieves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| We didn't budget for that in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| They made that request to us, and we failed to put it in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| and we said if we had a budget surplus then we could pass that along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| So it basically helps to fund the Tennessee Achieves program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| and they've actually went to, I think, all 95 counties in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| asking for some funding for that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| And then under Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| that was the loss that they did not receive from the amusement tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| So what will happen is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| We knew as the amusement tax went away, some of those parking and permits would have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| So this year we told, when we did the budget and had a conversation with Doug Battelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| we said, okay, starting with budget FY19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| we will start including funding for park improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| that we'll use some one-time dollars this year just to bridge that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| And that funding has been pretty flat for the last five, six, seven, eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| Was there no option to increase that funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| Actually, the last three years it would have decreased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| because we've reduced that amusement tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| and amusement tax is what funded those park improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| But the total dollars that the Parks Department received has just been a flat amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| Are you talking about the total park budget as a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| On the $150,000 that we do already budget and then this $100,000, the $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| has that not been pretty flat the last couple of years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| It was always basically the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| but what amount we got in from amusement tax we would designate just for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| And so we had to stair-step that down as the amusement tax goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| And then under non-departmental, the emergency tree removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| will that be reimbursed for the expenses at the cove from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| This is not for the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| This is basically a request that we received from risk management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| for the replacement of trees, and I think Mark could talk more to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4522)|
| 1:15:30| It actually helps in areas, and I'm not an expert in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| but that has nothing to do with the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| And then the next one down, grant match, $50,000, what is that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| That is a grant match for a grant that we receive from the state to the attorney general's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| and we choose to put that in the designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| This is the second year we put that in the designation list instead of adding it to their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| We already went over Republic Plastics, and then the Sotomayor Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| was that a request from them to the Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| It was a request from the Sotomayor Center during the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| and this is one of those that we lay to the side to see if we're going to have a budget surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| and it's for they're building one or two new duplexes for their centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4573)|
| 1:16:22| and so they asked for help in funding one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| And the same on the Urban League for $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| That was another budget request during the budget process that we pushed to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| They actually asked, I think, for $250,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| and we chose to fund with budget surplus $100,000 for renovations to their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4599)|
| 1:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| And I noticed in the Sheriff's Department that they've gotten over $525,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| Did we not purchase vehicles in the regular budget that we approved on May 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| What we do is the Sheriff will ask for usually a set number of 50 vehicles a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| We have continuously increased that number to get to a number of 50 to help them with their fleet rotation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| and this is we continue to bridge that gap every year until we can budget to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| And so this is their request for one-time monies to purchase 10 vehicles that helps to bridge that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| because we did not fund 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| We funded 40 or 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| And then the next one down, the Executime Enterprise Workforce Management for $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Is that a clocking in, clocking out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Basically, they are in the process of trying to find a better system for time management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4665)|
| 1:17:53| and this is one option that they're looking at, and this was the first expense of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4673)|
| 1:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| And then one of the positive things I saw in here under the hotel-motel designation, the Zoo Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4683)|
| 1:18:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| And that was to fund the new entrance sign there at, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| No, that's already been funded and paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| The other thing is to get us to we, the mayor proposed in this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| approved a capital campaign contribution of $4.35 million a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| and we said we would pay that over five years but would like to pay it over three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| This helps us to, this gets us to doing that through year two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| and then we'll continue to do that in year three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| So it's further capital campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| Kind of piggybacking on Commissioner Schoonmaker's comment to the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| I would also like to comment that I'm glad to see, as I refer to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| product used in tourism being funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| and there are two or three examples of that in these designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4754)|
| 1:19:22| You can advertise all day, but if you do not have product to show or for people to visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4762)|
| 1:19:30| we're not balancing the teeter-totter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| No further, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Mr. Caldwell, have we received this money now all from the state so we're ready to dish it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| or is this in hopes that in another 30 days we will have the total $4.something million in our hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4782)|
| 1:19:50| This is not money from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| I meant like sales tax return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| No, no, we're still accruing that back, so we have sales tax that comes in probably this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| and we're continuing to close out the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| So we'll have accruals that we will do through the first of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| and so we know at that point of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| We've got to, state law says we have to close our books by August the 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| and so we have to be substantially complete by then, and this is part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| And if we don't get the total amount, do you have a list of which items will be deleted from this list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| We will have the total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4831)|

| 1:20:48| Madam Clerk, I believe it's item 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4848)|

| 1:21:20| Is Mr. Myers available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4880)|

| 1:21:33| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| Under the defined services contract, Article 2, there's performance reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| and it says there's a quarterly performance measures report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Who receives that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4910)|

| 1:21:54| Ben Charble receives those right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| And he maintains those, and those are not disseminated to anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4916)|

| 1:22:02| They're a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4925)|

| 1:22:24| Madam Clerk, backing up to 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| Consideration of a resolution approving an extension of ambulance service agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| with Rural Metro of Tennessee, LP, to provide medical ambulance services in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| for an additional five-year term, July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| as allowed in the current contract subject to Knox County Commission Approval Resolution 604.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4963)|
| 1:22:51| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| I want to make a substitute motion to re-bid the contract, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4975)|
| 1:23:05| You don't have to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| You're making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| You're making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| I want to make a motion then we re-bid the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| In 2013, the contract with Rural Metro of Tennessee, LP, was signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| At the present, only two commissioners that were involved in that discussion are sitting on the desk right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| I requested a copy of the existing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| During my review, I realized there has been a new ownership since 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| AMR, American Medical Resource, became AMR Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| I am also aware on August 8, 2017, a press release indicating Vision Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5040)|
| 1:24:08| the parent company of AMR, is to sell American Medical Resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5048)|
| 1:24:17| The press release indicates that there will be a new company created between AMR and Air Medical Group Holdings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5057)|
| 1:24:27| With that said, I have a question of what will be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| and ultimately how this change could impact the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| In reviewing the existing agreement, I have questions regarding 9-11 calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| and the distribution of ambulance and first responder vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| I'm looking to understand the actual process and procedure involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| Also, within the last three months, I have had many calls regarding billings from AMR Rural Metro Ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5093)|
| 1:25:02| and also the Rural Metro Fire Departments from my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| These appear to be miscommunications between the public and for the double billing of ambulance and first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5107)|
| 1:25:17| In some situations, people are being billed $1,450 for an ambulance and $1,450 for a first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5117)|
| 1:25:27| Of course, this only impacts the county residents who do not have subscription to AMR Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5127)|
| 1:25:36| Unfortunately, in some situations, there was not a need for either service at the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5136)|
| 1:25:43| For instance, a wreck occurred, somebody called the 9-1-1, no need for an ambulance or the first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| I would like to know how we can effectively eliminate some of this confusion between the constituents and Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5151)|
| 1:26:00| Section 502 in the contract indicates that the county shall, upon approval of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5160)|
| 1:26:08| establish the EMS Medical Service Cost Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| This board's authority will be limited to approval or disapproval of all subsequent increases in charges the contractor proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5173)|
| 1:26:24| Per the agreement, and I quote, the county intent is to establish a board of five members recommended by the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5184)|
| 1:26:32| with subsequent approval required by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| It also indicates that one member of the county is a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5197)|
| 1:26:44| Has this board been established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Regarding ambulance staffing, how many qualified personnel do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| How many do we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| What kind of turnover in staffing is being experienced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| Has the lack of staffing impact service of Knox County to Knox County citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| Also, are there any specific identified first responder vehicles other than the fire truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5225)|
| 1:27:16| These are only a few of the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| I still am not sure why we're addressing a request for an extension for another five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5239)|
| 1:27:26| when we have 11 months out to the end of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| With all this, I would ask the county commission to have this re-bid so we can answer some of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5250)|
| 1:27:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| Anyone else wishing to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Since we have the first motion, it is not the stated agenda motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5271)|
| 1:27:58| If this motion fails, do we go back to the original, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5278)|
| 1:28:05| The agenda itself doesn't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| It has a resolution to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| I'll make a substitute motion that we approve the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5289)|
| 1:28:20| I hear a motion and a second to institute the resolution as stated in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5300)|
| 1:28:31| Do you want me to pull that so we can still discuss it, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| You may have a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| In all fairness, he's asked several questions and now he's just been shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| I can pull it, but before we take a vote, I'll have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5324)|
| 1:28:51| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| I don't disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| I think everybody needs to be able to have an opportunity to say what they need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| I'll pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5338)|
| 1:29:08| Commissioner Geale, did you wish to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| The clarification was just made for me because this motion is still on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| Commissioner Anderson, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| Commissioner Bussler, questions that you raised, are you wishing to have Dr. Buchanan address those today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| Like I said, these are just a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5370)|
| 1:29:42| If you want to say you want a 60 or 90 day deferral to where we can sit down and have a public forum and go over these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5382)|
| 1:29:51| I don't know if anybody else has looked over the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| if you've seen any of the other issues that may arise with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| I'm just saying that it's some of the issues we need to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5401)|
| 1:30:13| We really just need to take time and go over it instead of just saying approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| because some of the citizens out there are being double charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| and we have a board that should have been formed when it was first done in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| which was not done to, I guess, look over some of these charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5429)|
| 1:30:39| It's kind of troubling that we're at this stage right there where we're going to try to approve it right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| Maybe this is the best deal we have, but we don't know until we ask somebody else to bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| Do we have a better option is what I'm trying to say, or is this the best option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| If it is, I'm fine with it, but let's just don't blanketly approve it until we see what we do have available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5458)|
| 1:31:07| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| Dr. Buchanan, you heard the questions, some of the questions that were asked there a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| I recognize Dr. Buchanan of Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| Yes, Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| I will try to answer some of your questions, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| I didn't take a lot of notes, so there were lots of questions in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| The one about 502 and the medical services cost review board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| in the past what has happened is when the holder of the contract has wanted to increase fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5495)|
| 1:31:44| then this body approves that board, and that board reviews those requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| It's not an active board that reviews fees regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| but it's only upon request when an increase in fees is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| That hasn't happened in these five years, so we haven't convened the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| Thank you, Miss. I just want to ask this one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| I looked at some of the minimum costs or what they would do for a non-subscriber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5532)|
| 1:32:19| and I'm looking out for some of the non-subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| They said it's a minimum of $750 charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| Okay. Can I ask a clarifying question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| When you talk about subscription, you're talking about fire, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| No, ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Well, I guess it's when you subscribe to rural metro, do you get both fire and ambulance service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5558)|
| 1:32:48| Rural metro, help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Hold on, they're coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Yeah, I think that the subscription service primarily is fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| There is an ambulance subscription service as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| Chris can explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Hi, good afternoon. Chris Blatch, 10140 Gallows Point Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| There are two different charge structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| One of them is isolated to the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| They have their subscription program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| and then they bill non-subscribers for fire requests for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5596)|
| 1:33:23| They don't charge for medical requests for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| On the EMS side, we have a charge schedule, as Dr. Buchanan stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| It's been in place for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| We have not asked for a rate increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| and it's based upon the level of service that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| What I'm asking about, and this is the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| I've had in the last three months some people show me their bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| Okay, one of them says that one of the charges, like for 1450 is for a ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| what shows on the bill sent to them is for a engine or a tenderer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5636)|
| 1:34:04| which is a fire truck that goes out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| and it's a non-transferable type situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| where all they're asking for is an ambulance to take someone to a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| The first responder shows up, which is the fire truck, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| and they get a bill from the fire service for $1450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| They also get a bill for the ambulance service, which is $1450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5668)|
| 1:34:35| That's almost $3,000 they get when they only ask for one service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| My question is, why do we have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| And I understand somebody said you have to have a first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| Is the fire truck the only first responder we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| And why are they being charged twice for that one service they requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5693)|
| 1:35:02| Good afternoon. I'm Jerry Harnish, Fire Chief for Rural Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| 160 North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| Mr. Busler, the fire department doesn't charge the patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| so the fire department charge to a non-subscriber is to a property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| either someone who owns real property or personal property, such as a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| So when an individual calls 911, for instance, for an auto accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| the emergency communications center automatically sends the closest medically trained unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| and typically that is a fire engine, whether it's ours, the city of Knoxville, or Karnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| a rescue unit, and an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| So if someone is treated and transported to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| there is a charge from the ambulance service to the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| There will be a charge from the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| if the property owner is non-subscribed to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Now there is a circumstance where it could be the same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| For instance, the owner of a vehicle who is not subscribed to the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5769)|
| 1:36:15| who also is injured and becomes the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| That would be a very unusual circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| But in any case, the rate structures are separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| The fire department receives no income from the ambulance service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| and the ambulance service receives no income from the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| And the structures that Rural Metro is using are those that are identical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| It just so happens in the areas where we provide fire service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| the company that owns us both is operating the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| Is that helpful, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| In a manner of speaking, but I've also got a bill from a person for a first responder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5808)|
| 1:36:56| that a few months ago we had a storm come through north Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| It knocked a tree down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| He was on the road, stopped, turned around, was going back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| and there was a power line down in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| I think he called KUB or somebody and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Hey, I'm here, I would like for you to get out here, turn the power off so I can go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| He did not call the, as he told me, he did not call 911 for that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| He called, tried to call, I guess, somebody from KUB or something like that to get it turned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5852)|
| 1:37:40| A fire truck showed up, walked down to him, said, Are you all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| He said, Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| He said, I didn't call you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| I just called KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| He receives a month later a charge from a fire truck from rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5871)|
| 1:38:03| I don't understand that billing practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| and there's other issues that I've had with the same billing where it's called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| This may have to do with 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| how they put out their calls for these different instances that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| But I have got some information here and bills that these people are being charged twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| for only one service they've asked for, and I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| I thought first responder and the ambulance service was one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| Is that wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Yes, sir, that is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| Ambulance service is provided by AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| First responder service is provided by rural metro fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| and even though we're owned by the same parent, they are separate operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| and they are funded separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| So if my grandmother falls down at the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| and I pick up the phone and said, I need ambulance transportation for her to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| and the fire truck shows up and the ambulance shows up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| if only I requested one, what did I get charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| In that instance, I would say you would only be charged for the ambulance transport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5953)|
| 1:39:20| because the fire department doesn't bill patients for first responder services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| So there are a number of instances that you're aware of that I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| and I'd be happy to discuss them, but I think it's probably...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| Well, I understand that, but what is miscommunicated here is they needed one service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5975)|
| 1:39:43| but they're billing for two, a non-life-threatening request for ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5983)|
| 1:39:51| They should only get one bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| I would have to know more specifics, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| If it's a non-emergency transport, then 911 doesn't send a first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| If it's literally a non-emergency transport, the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| whether it's ours or KFD or Karn's, is not sent in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| Now, there are instances when we receive requests from the public for non-emergency lifting assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6015)|
| 1:40:24| and up until very recently we did not provide non-emergency services to non-subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| We've reversed that because there are people who would be harmed if they didn't receive a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| But generally speaking, if someone called for a non-emergency transport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6036)|
| 1:40:42| that's not even handled by the emergency side of the communications center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6042)|
| 1:40:51| I've got a list of things that I've covered in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| and the reason why I asked for this particular motion, which I made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| was there's some way across here we've got to get an understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| and also as we talked the other day about the indigent care provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6065)|
| 1:41:13| I've asked people to go out there that have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| do you know about this provision that you all provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| And they don't know, but if they need that service, they will get billed the full service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6079)|
| 1:41:26| And I wondered how we're going to correct that problem down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| because this contract does not get that information out to the people that need that sort of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6090)|
| 1:41:39| And they need to be educated, and that's one of the things I think we need to address in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| It's not a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| It's listed as an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| So that's where I'm from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| And then when they don't pay the bill, which they say they don't need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| they didn't ask for, they get a note saying that you're going to put a lien on their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| And these are people that can't afford hardly even, well, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| They're needing help, and that we need to address also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| May I clarify a couple things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| One is there actually are four first responder groups in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| Knoxville Fire Department, Rural Metro Fire, Carnes, and Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| And as you know, the contract allows for the use of first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| so that somebody can get there quickly when there's an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| and take care of those needs before the ambulance gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| And so that's what the first responders do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| It's silent about billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| It doesn't speak to that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| The piece about the indigent care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| those are very specific people that are enrolled in a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| that the Knox County Health Department pays for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| and they receive their care through Cherokee Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| So they have to be actually enrolled in that program to qualify for not being charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| So there's some communication that goes back and forth so that hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| and Rural Metro and other folks know who's enrolled in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| and that changes periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| So that's a very specific group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| Get off the button again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| I've got concerns as long as Commissioner Boesler does about the way things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6209)|
| 1:43:37| I really believe if I'm sitting at home tonight and I have a heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| my wife calls 9-1-1 and says my husband's having a heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| Rural Metro shows up, ambulance from UT shows up, I'll get two bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| There's no doubt in my mind I would get two bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| So I understand what Commissioner Boesler's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| I've got a concern on the zero scores on Level 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| In 2013 there was $46,000, and I'm going to call them fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6240)|
| 1:44:09| And then in 2016 we jumped to $262,000, and we get a score of a zero there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| I mean, that's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| It should have been the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| It should have been from $46,000 down to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| How do you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| Yes, we gave them a score of zero because during this contract period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| there were some higher-than-usual performance damages assessed because of performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6276)|
| 1:44:44| What we saw was those maxed out in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| We've seen them trending better this year, so they're improving in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| We have seen improved performance, and it even decreased in the number of Level 0s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| We review their performance monthly with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Larry Hutzel and myself and folks from Rural Metro sit down and review that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| and that's when those fines are assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| Chris Blotch can speak to all the things they've done to improve staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| So we are seeing a trend toward improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| We will continue to keep an eye on that, as is our job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| and continue to hold them accountable to meet the demands and keep our citizens safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6324)|
| 1:45:31| Chris, do you want to speak to what you've done to improve performance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| Over the last year and a half, AMR has invested well over $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| We've done wage adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| We've done a nationwide recruitment campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| We've had $15,000 sign-on bonuses for paramedics, $7,500 sign-on bonuses for EMT Advanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6351)|
| 1:45:59| and we've hired a lot of folks from across the country to come and work in the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| and that's why there's been such a dramatic improvement in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| Staffing issues are not isolated to Rural Metro here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| It's a nationwide shortage of EMS staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| EMTs are folks that are not going into the career field, so we've actually had to partner with Rhone State College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6380)|
| 1:46:29| We had their instructors come out, and we held courses right at our location for EMTs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6389)|
| 1:46:36| We put about 50 folks through an EMT training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| We've spent $50,000 this year in paramedic scholarships and just graduated a class of paramedics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6399)|
| 1:46:47| They're just going through their training, and they should be hitting the streets within the next couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| We've paid for advanced EMT training programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| We've invested a lot over the last year and a half to get where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6415)|
| 1:47:04| Dr. Buchanan, number four says the contractor shall consistently demonstrate clinical performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6424)|
| 1:47:13| and you say we do not believe that the contractor met these requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| Can you explain what the requirements were and why they did not meet these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| Let me pull out another piece of paper to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| So the process for requesting an extension, Rural Metro, AMR put together justification for each of these points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6445)|
| 1:47:37| and I will need to find their justification for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| So in their justification for the number four clinical performance standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| they discussed the things they're doing across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| They didn't discuss specific things they're doing here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| and we felt like that didn't really answer our question, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| what are you doing here to improve performance in your clinical performance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| So that's why we scored them zero, and this is kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| I think it's important to point out that scoring is a little weird in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| So in that level one section, you can get a zero or you can get a two, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| You can't get a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| In the next level, level two, we could score them zero, one, or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6502)|
| 1:48:28| So if you dinged them, you had to ding them down to zero in that first section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| You couldn't give them a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| So we just felt like they didn't answer our question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| which is we wanted to know what they were doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| and we are aware of some of the things they've done here because we have quarterly meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| quarterly quality improvement meetings with all the first responders that Larry convenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| Larry Hutzel is my employee who convenes those, and we go over those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| and they're putting different things in place to improve outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| One of the things they've not in this five years but fairly recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| they started using a different kind of breathing mask to reduce intubation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6545)|
| 1:49:10| So fewer people have to get intubated, and that's a really great thing for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6550)|
| 1:49:15| So they are doing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| They just didn't talk about them in their response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6556)|
| 1:49:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| We also have our medical director, Dr. Brooksbank, who's here to support us as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| and our clinical manager is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| We also put together a three-page supplement just to talk briefly about many of the clinical efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| that we have going on locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| Roger Brooksbank, medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| Could I have your name and address for the record, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| Roger Brooksbank, medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| I'm not sure where I'm addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| Last name again, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| Last name again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Brooksbank, B-R-O-O-K-S-B-A-N-K, emergency physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| Been in Knox County for over 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| Been working for Rural Metro for over 15 years as their medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| Although they have changed hands in the last 45 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| we continue to have a presence in this community with local people who help run the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| Again, I've been with the service over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| I'm not sure how many years, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| We've been together a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| We've done a lot of things clinically in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| You heard earlier about Dr. Buchanan talk a little bit about the Narcan use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| and how do we better serve our people with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| We've also been doing things with Lucas devices, CPAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| a multitude of different things that we've specifically instituted in this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| to provide better care for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| Emergency medicine and how we provide that service in the EMS at local locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| changes all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| And we are always trying to look at what's the current way to do the treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| what's the best way to do the treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| We don't want to be on the bleeding edge of making something that's a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| but we want to do what's the appropriate care for patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| Chris, do you want to talk a little bit about some further stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| Chris McLean, 10140 Gallows Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| Just to echo Dr. Brooksbank, we have great partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| I think Commissioner Bussel was asking a question about the first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| Quarterly, and even more frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| we meet with them to provide information on the best and most up-to-date clinical practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6679)|
| 1:51:25| as well as we have partnerships with all three of the hospital groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| whether it's Covenant, whether it's Tenova or UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| We're constantly, and Mr. Daley asked about cardiac care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| we've made great strides in what's called a code STEMI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| which is someone having a heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| where now we take patients straight from the ambulance to the cath lab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| bypassing the ER, saving time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| and that is big when it comes to cardiac care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| as well as stroke management with the code strokes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| taking them straight to the CT scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| So we are really at the tip of the spear here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| as far as clinical evidence-based medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| and that's what the nation is driving us for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| So any questions you may have over other stuff we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6729)|
| 1:52:17| I don't have a question for you, but I appreciate the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| See, this is information that I as a commissioner don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| They're asking me to make a decision in two weeks that concerns the whole county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| and I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| This is probably the biggest decision I will make next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| is whether to vote to approve the five years or send it out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| It's not going to be how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| It's going to be what I think is best for the Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| I don't think that we should be voting for it next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| I think we need more time for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| It might be September before we take a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| because I'd like to have more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| I'd like Dr. Buchanan to provide more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| This is an important decision, and it's kind of hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| and sometimes it's aggravating, and I'll use the word aggravating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| It's aggravating to me to get something a week before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| or a week and a half before and expect us to know everything that's going on about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| or expect me to know what's going on about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| I want to know more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| I don't feel comfortable to not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| If Commissioner Anders wants to change in second motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| I will probably vote no on that motion because I think we need more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| I'd like to thank Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| I'd like for you to come back up, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| All the information that you've got from all these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| can you provide it to Commission so we can sit down and look at some of these meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| Are there minutes and notes taken on these meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| I'm not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| Yes, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| I didn't want to promise something I couldn't promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| Well, if I can, that would be great for my sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| I can see a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| If we change, I can see a lot of things maybe happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| We've got infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| We've got vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| We've got buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| We've got a ton of things that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| I've been in the business world for almost 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| We've signed long-term agreements with extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| and they get re-quoted even though I've got a long-term agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6866)|
| 1:54:32| I'm not saying that I'm going to vote for it one way or the other at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| I'm just asking for information, more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| so we can gather and see what I can gather and see what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| because I think it's very, very important that we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6884)|
| 1:54:50| I might make a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| I may be out of line or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| But one of these county commissioners that when you have the quarterly meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| it would be nice if we designated a commissioner to be there to see what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| because this is, to me, this is the most important issue that I, in my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| I guess this is our 12th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| I think this will be our 12th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| This is the most important decision I'm going to make in 12 meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| and I'm going to take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| I'm not promising you that I'll vote for rural metro AMR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| and I'm not promising that I'll vote against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| I'm just going to do what's best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| I have concerns also like some of my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| and Carson asked, too, the questions that I was going to ask about the Level 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6943)|
| 1:55:49| Another concern is why is it being done so quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| Why did it just pop up within the last two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| And I also feel, as Commissioner Daly, that this is, it's not about how I feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6959)|
| 1:56:06| but it's about what's best for our Knox County citizens out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| This is a very, very important decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| and I was very fortunate to get to go through the AMR Rural Metro Citizens Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6978)|
| 1:56:25| a few months ago, and the people there that are working, our first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6985)|
| 1:56:32| the fire department and everyone there, you know, I just can't say enough about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=6992)|
| 1:56:40| very trained and people that have absolutely dedicated their lives to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7000)|
| 1:56:48| There was another thing that we had gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| and that was about the AMR Rural Metro performance damages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| and it goes all the way back as all the fines that they've gotten every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7017)|
| 1:57:05| and then you come all the way down to June 1st through 30th, and there's zero fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| and then July 1st through 31st, and there's zero fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| And to me, that really put up a red flag of how you can have fines for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7037)|
| 1:57:26| two or three years back every single month, and then come down to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| And then I received another copy of those same fines, and as of June 1st through June 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7053)|
| 1:57:40| there actually had been $7,000 worth of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| That was not on my previous copy that was sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| So I had a question about the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| I just thought that was very interesting, that felt like it needed to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7074)|
| 1:58:02| And then I have some heartburn with it being in the process of AMR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| only being the apparent company for, what, the past three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7089)|
| 1:58:16| and then that it is in the process of being bought out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| And this is my concern for the employees of AMR as well as the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7101)|
| 1:58:29| What this new company plans to do when they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| because we all know that when new companies come in, they can promise everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| but when they come in, they get rid of people, and I have a real concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| And, you know, I just feel like this is being put on us in a rush-rush situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7124)|
| 1:58:52| and it's very important that we make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| And, you know, I'm not saying anybody else is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| I mean, I'm just saying we have to listen to our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| and when they say we want it put out for bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| then I have to do what I feel is right for the best of the people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| And I just share the same concerns that Commissioner Daley just spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7152)|
| 1:59:19| So I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| This is a very important contract with both you and Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| As far as why now, the why now is if you don't vote for this extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7166)|
| 1:59:31| we will re-bid the contract, and that takes a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7171)|
| 1:59:36| So we want to, if you don't vote for the extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| we want to have enough time to get a new service in place by July 1st of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7179)|
| 1:59:46| So we anticipate that we'll need that much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| I don't know if you want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Just to echo what Dr. Buchanan said, this is one that takes several months to complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| not only to get specifications drafted, a document out on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| but also time for the responders to submit back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| They're obviously very lengthy documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| The evaluation of something of this nature takes several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| The reason we are coming to you now is to hopefully get the extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| and progress for another five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| It does take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| And I understand that, and that's why I hope that you all would understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| that when we're making one of the biggest decisions that we could possibly make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7232)|
| 2:00:37| that we need to be informed a little bit more about understanding the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7237)|
| 2:00:43| what we're voting on, and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| I mean, if it takes you all months, months to do a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| it takes us more than two weeks to make sure that we're making the best decision for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7251)|
| 2:00:57| for the employees at AMR and for the citizens in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| With it being up for sale, and that possibly has already gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| that makes it even more important to make sure that everybody is taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| Well, I think as we saw in the first time they were acquired, people are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| People are solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| I know Real Metro would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| AMR would say that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| So they're just solid people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| It looks like a holding company saw a profitable venture, if you look at the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| So they decided to try to acquire AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| And I'm sure they'll operate just as they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| Well, yes, but I just don't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| That's why, you know, I'd like to know a little bit more about this company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| that has come in to acquire what they're planning on doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7312)|
| 2:01:59| Commissioner Gill, as soon as we hear this response, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| So just to speak a little bit about the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| We were purchased or were in the process of being purchased by a company called KKR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| And essentially Envision Healthcare made a strategic decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| They wanted to focus on physicians' practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| and they wanted to divest themselves of the ambulance business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| So they sold AMR to KKR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| and the intention is that they'll develop a new parent corporation that will oversee AMGH,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7350)|
| 2:02:37| which is the largest helicopter program, medical helicopter program in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| They actually service UT and AMR's ambulance business along with River Metro's fire division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7362)|
| 2:02:51| So they're going to join the businesses together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| and have a streamlined pre-hospital emergency business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| The new CEO of the parent corporation is actually someone that's been with AMR for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7381)|
| 2:03:10| He's staying on Randy Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| He'll be the CEO of the parent corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| And they're keeping AMR's executive team in place, including our CEO, Ted Van Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7394)|
| 2:03:21| So I don't anticipate any changes whatsoever on the local operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7401)|
| 2:03:27| The legal entity of Rural Metro Tennessee is remaining intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7407)|
| 2:03:35| Yes, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| You had a question about the fines, and I have to get clarification from Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| The first attachment you received, we had not evaluated June yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7423)|
| 2:03:50| So the second one, June had been evaluated, so it had been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| We haven't done July yet because we're always a little behind in getting that evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7434)|
| 2:04:00| So that's why those were zeros the first time, and that's why they're filled in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| We just caught up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| This is for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| The score AMR received was 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| Here is where I need some clarification because I'm a little confused on the score reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7460)|
| 2:04:28| because under Level 1, you did receive the score of a zero there because I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7468)|
| 2:04:37| understand if it's clinical, your response time, where is the level of performance for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7477)|
| 2:04:45| the score evaluation between the zero and the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| Is it the response time that gets the most points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Is it the level of service points or clinical that's a little confusing under Level 1 for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7492)|
| 2:05:03| number 2 and number 4 where zeros were scored?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7503)|
| 2:05:11| I'm hesitating because I want to make sure I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| So your performance numbers for the damages being assessed are for what reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7514)|
| 2:05:21| Response times or clinical assessments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| Now I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| If you look at the contract, number 2 is based on the Section 705 of the contract that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7529)|
| 2:05:37| assesses fines for response times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| That's what that's based on, totally response times, not clinical performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| So number 4 then is based upon what requirement for that number to be scored a zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| Number 4, we ask them to tell us what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| The contractor consistently demonstrates clinical performance standards which comply with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| county and state rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| And in that section in their answer, they talked a whole lot about what AMR does around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| country, but they did not speak to what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| And they do great work, and we know they do work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| So it didn't satisfy what we were looking for in their response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| And that leads to my question, because he said training, staffing, salary, which I assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| goes to retention and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| But he never made a statement regarding the clinical aspect of what they have done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| improve that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| And that would probably be Dr. Brooks-Banks or Chris who could speak to that better than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| Chairman Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| Some of the initiatives that we talked about as far as the first responder group, through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| those quarterly meetings, we're meeting with CARNs, City of Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| Rural Metro Fire Department, looking for areas to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| Some of the things we've looked at is community CPR, where we go out and train members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| the community to have quicker access to someone that has sudden cardiac arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| And part of that was looking at data from the Lucas CPR device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7632)|
| 2:07:17| If you're not familiar, the Lucas device is actually a machine that we can place on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| someone that goes into sudden cardiac arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| And through our data, through the good clinical evidence-based medicine, we showed that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| had improvements throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| With that data and that information, City of Knoxville Fire Department has now placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| those devices on their fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| So throughout Knoxville City and Knox County, that's one of the major improvements we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7661)|
| 2:07:46| And then we also allocated our other ones, because we had provided devices to CARNs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7666)|
| 2:07:51| Lucas devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| We had provided some devices to Knoxville City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| We were able to take those and now put them out there so we have more around the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| One of the other major initiatives is, like I said, STEMI and stroke care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| It's never been better here within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| We are actually part of the hospital groups, whether it's the chest pain accreditation groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| or the stroke groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| And we're now literally down to saving seconds instead of trying to cut minutes off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| We're far above the national standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| Each one of these facilities this past year, through our partnership with them and their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| towards these programs, have received JCO accreditation in both the STEMI and stroke world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7713)|
| 2:08:40| And that was part of our initiative as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| Dr. Brooksbank, and it's a hot topic for all of us, the opiate issue throughout City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7723)|
| 2:08:51| and Knox County, as well as around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| We are making great strides with that, and that's actually one of the items that's on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| to try to curb that and do our part to hopefully eradicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7739)|
| 2:09:06| It would be a big wish, but we're at least out educating the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| We're making sure this Narcan's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| We have it on each of our units to be able to respond when these people have these overdose situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| Some other stuff we looked at is some protocol changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| Dr. Brooksbank, he's very aware of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| He physically works in the ERs throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| He oversees our RNCC committee, which is also a group of EMS responders here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| as well as our quarterly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| And we've put in protocols to take care and meet the patient's needs in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7779)|
| 2:09:45| One good example is adrenal insufficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| We have a small population that's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| We recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| We made sure we did education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| We had the medication out there to be able to treat those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| And those are some of the core things that we've done throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| Roger Brooksbank again, real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| I could talk about clinical initiatives for 100 days, so be careful with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| A couple things that we've done in 2017 I think that are really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| just the new things that we're putting in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| One is what they call a pediatric sleeve, which is when we walk upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| and we get called to respond to a pediatric patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| all of our units now are given these sleeves that they're able to put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| And what happens is this sleeve goes over the paramedic's arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| It gives the exact doses on the exact size of the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| So we know exactly the correct size in an emergency situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| to give a 2-year-old child, a 6-month-old child, an 8-year-old child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| All doses are differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| So instead of them trying to have to figure out exact doses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| those doses are right there where they can see them, quickly reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| and be able to provide quicker service to those patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| The second thing that we've actually begun to put in place too is tourniquet use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| I would tell you when I was in training 25 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| we were using tourniquets for bad bleeds, bad gunshot wounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| things as some of these mass casualties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| that you've seen across the different parts of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| We have found that use of tourniquets with the military experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| the use of tourniquets is something that's a very positive thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| and we're putting those things in place in 2017 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| So just a couple of examples of what we've done just this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| Just to add on to that, we actually went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| and trained all the school resource officers just last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| in the use of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| It's called Stop the Bleed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| We partnered with the UT Medical Center, the trauma services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| and went out and trained 80, 89 of the school resource officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| to make sure they know how to use these tourniquets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| in the event that one of our kids have a severe injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| So we're very engaged with the different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| That was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7914)|
| 2:11:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7917)|
| 2:12:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| Just two things on the scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| One, aren't some of these fines that were assessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| due to self-reporting from AMR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| So they give us, I mean, we review with them their performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7940)|
| 2:12:27| over the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| Each month we review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| So it's actually all self-reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7951)|
| 2:12:35| We're also able to go in now with the new computer-aided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| dispatch system, the CAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| We can look at how they're doing and how they're responding real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7962)|
| 2:12:47| And then Larry gets notified when certain things happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| So we're able to keep track of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| So there's real-time reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| Later on in the month there's reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| So as part of the contract they have to report their performance to us, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| And then just a suggestion on your little chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| When you don't have data, don't put zero, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| Just leave it blank or a dash because I can understand the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| Yes, definitely never side on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| Because it looks like something's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| And then also I feel the frustration from Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| and Commissioner Carringer about the notice to commission about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8003)|
| 2:13:29| Now it's my understanding that, and Matt, you could verify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| that the procurement office knew about this about, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| July 10th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| July 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8023)|
| 2:13:52| It looks like June 29th is when this official document came into the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| Okay, so you actually had it in the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| We did to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| And I realize it's not your directive to notify commission on something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8039)|
| 2:14:06| even though it is probably the biggest thing that Knox County Commission deals with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| But in the future do you think that, and maybe this is a question for Dean Rice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| that on something that's this important to the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8056)|
| 2:14:23| that the commission could be briefed that this is coming down the pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| and get ready for your August meeting to go over the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8066)|
| 2:14:30| So Commissioner Daley is not sitting here with a dozen questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| trying to get them answered at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| We can certainly, you know, in the next renewal period reach out sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| I mean this renewal wouldn't necessarily take effect until July 1 of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| Correct, but we've got to decide whether that goes forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| So just the advanced information I think would have been helpful to all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| if we'd known about it at the beginning of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| And then the only other thing I was going to say is before next Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8101)|
| 2:15:06| maybe you could, I was trying to have a hard time, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| keeping up with all the questions you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| Could you put those in writing and give it to the contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| so they have a chance to answer those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| and we can see the responses back before Monday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8116)|
| 2:15:21| Commissioner Schoonmaker, that's just a few that I thought was most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8121)|
| 2:15:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| but I was having a hard time trying to keep a list of what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| So in all fairness to them to be able to respond off the cuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8131)|
| 2:15:38| So that's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8138)|
| 2:15:44| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| Moving to Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| I've got one, I guess, point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| not as much for our fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| but also for the residents who may be watching this at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| What's created some confusion, especially I think as it relates to billing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| is we've got one company that has both our first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| and our fire engines for the county as well as the ambulance contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8165)|
| 2:16:10| and we were talking earlier about bills for each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| Now, to clarify, especially for our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| if the contract was held by a different company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| and you had a first responder respond as well as an ambulance respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| they would still probably get two bills, just to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| I just want to make sure that's clear because it's a little bit potentially vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| I think, for a resident who might just be stepping in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| Commissioner Nystrom, Jerry Harnish again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| That's the case now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| So there are parts of Knox County we don't serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| where a first responder is sent from a fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| and AMR sends the ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| and that fire department then bills for the first responder service independently of AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8212)|
| 2:16:58| So if the contract were to change hands, that would remain the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| I've understood that. I just want to make sure that it's crystal clear in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| I've got a handful of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| and I don't want you all to go back over some of the answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| but before this meeting I wrote down—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| Commissioner Nystrom, let me ask just a second if you would allow me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8237)|
| 2:17:21| There's a related question here from Commissioner Smith on a subject you just wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| Thank you. I'll go ahead and cede my time to Commissioner Smith if you could come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| This is a related question on the topic you were just on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| So if you are a county resident who is a subscriber to Royal Metro Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8253)|
| 2:17:39| you would not be receiving that bill for the first responder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| And we also have a subscription program for our ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| It's $89 a year for a household, and it covers all out-of-pocket expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8271)|
| 2:17:57| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| Very good. Thank you. Thank you for that follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| Don't go back and feel like you've got to answer all these things because some of these have been covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| but these were my three questions, which is related to the clinical coverage in the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8287)|
| 2:18:14| Question number one was, did they complete the request for the extension of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| by just covering their national programs more so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| Question number two was, did they complete local compliance but not document the compliance correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8303)|
| 2:18:28| And question number three was, did they not meet the local standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| Because I know in the responses on this evaluating with the zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| it appeared as if the issue was more of a documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8315)|
| 2:18:41| as if the grant responder had not noted some of the local stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| And it's up to you if you want to answer this, because we have heard some evidence of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| But if they had added that, is it possible that that might have been scored differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| if they had responded to this correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| Yes. The very short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| So they met the clinical performance measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| but didn't include how they met those on the local level in their response to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| So they didn't document what they've done properly, which is why we gave them a zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8354)|
| 2:19:20| And again, this is a section you can get zero or you can get two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| You can't get anything in between, so one wasn't an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| So yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| And so what it appeared to us was that they had provided us information about their national programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| but not about what they're doing on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| and we actually know what they're doing on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| So they didn't document it properly and didn't include it in their request for the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8379)|
| 2:19:49| Thank you, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| Still on the first round of questions, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| Yes. Really, just a couple of questions and a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| I guess I've worked with Rural Metro or been around Rural Metro for 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8399)|
| 2:20:06| on the street in the middle of the night and had my differences with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| I guess my question is, how many commissioners have engaged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| I know me and Mr. Schoonmaker have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| How many commissioners have engaged Rural Metro on a billing issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8416)|
| 2:20:20| or a response issue in the last 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| There's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| And so that goes back to, I mean, and I've been their toughest critic behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| Me and Jerry and me and Chris and me and Mr. Van Horn have had discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| but I was pretty critical of them, and they've not walked on water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8439)|
| 2:20:46| and when you pay them zero, that's hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| And so we're sitting here as the third largest county in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| paying zero dollars and complaining to the ambulance service in which we pay zero dollars to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8455)|
| 2:21:03| And three years ago as the chairman, I asked us to look at emergency services for a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| just like this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| Where are we at as a county and where do we need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| We ignored that, and now CTAS is in the middle of a study for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| but we keep kicking the can down the road, and there's a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| In my district we have Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| Carnes could show up in a fire truck and bill, and if Rural Metro takes them, that's another bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| That's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| It just happens to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| Two-thirds of the county outside the city limits just happens to be the same fire and ambulance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| So, I mean, it happens in my district as well, but it's two different services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8496)|
| 2:21:43| I guess, Dr. Buchanan, you've come across with a pretty high score of 16 above 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8503)|
| 2:21:52| and so I don't know why we came up with a two or a zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| That makes no sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| If you can't give somebody, if they're not perfect, they've got to be a zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| Where does that ever sound correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| I just want to make a statement that no questions have been asked predominantly of Rural Metro publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8527)|
| 2:22:15| for the last 12 to 16 months, and then now it's this big, huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| And I've went to them and had my issues resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| In the last three years, it's the first time Rural Metro has resolved the issues I've brought to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8544)|
| 2:22:29| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8549)|
| 2:22:30| They're not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| We still have level zeros, obviously, with the fines, and we still have issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| but we're not to the point where I think filling the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| So I'm going to make a substitute motion that's not going to affect the discussion of passing it without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| because I think if we vote on Mr. Butler's, Mr. Bustler's, it could really screw up the next agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8569)|
| 2:22:55| And so I think it's wise to send it without recommendation instead of with a negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| possibly negative vote with a negative discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8579)|
| 2:23:04| Do I hear a second on the motion to move to full commission, no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8584)|
| 2:23:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| Do I hear discussion of this motion to move with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8593)|
| 2:23:22| This is just to make the substitute motion what we have on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8602)|
| 2:23:34| This is just to make the motion on the floor, the substitute motion to be on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| The substitute motion to be on the floor if we approve the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8621)|
| 2:23:48| would be to continue to discuss it as the motion on the floor, not to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| It's just to substitute the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8638)|
| 2:24:04| And I have been affirmed by the law director all we're doing is changing the discussion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8644)|
| 2:24:10| from the motion that was previously there to the motion that would be on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| is to send a full commission, no recommendation, and then we will continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| Do I hear discussion of this substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| The current motion is to send it out for bids, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| That's the current, and then we're just going to change it for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| Because this is not the full commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| This is the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| Commissioner Anders, your motion on the floor is to substitute a motion of no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8684)|
| 2:24:53| Is there discussion of that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8693)|
| 2:24:59| Do you have discussion of that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| I'm just trying to figure out a substitute motion to deal with no recommendation to the existing resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8702)|
| 2:25:12| that we have before us on 604.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| I just need some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| So Mr. Bussler's original motion is gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| Would be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| Would be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| That's what I'm trying to make sure I got some clarification on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8725)|
| 2:25:29| The motion as entered on the floor would be gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| and the motion we would then continue to discuss would be to send to full commission no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8732)|
| 2:25:44| We're pausing for just a second to make sure that the law director is on board with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8744)|
| 2:25:53| You don't have to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| You can still discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| We are voting on using the substitute motion, which is a motion to full commission of no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8758)|
| 2:26:08| and then we will continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8768)|
| 2:26:12| Is everyone clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| I will not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| I will not take a vote while there is chatter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| Can I speak to the motion here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| Yes, you can speak to the substitute motion of no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| Since it's going to do away with my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| The reason why I brought this up to re-bid is there is some things that are left out of this agreement that we have right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8795)|
| 2:26:46| that we could address on a re-bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| We don't have to rewrite all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8809)|
| 2:26:52| but we need something more for the customer service end of it to where I'm answering these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8812)|
| 2:26:58| I'm doing the calling, and some of these individuals that I'm dealing with, let me express this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8818)|
| 2:27:06| I do have rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| I've had it, and it works, and it reduces my insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| Now, there are some people that can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| These people that can't afford it, when they do use it, the billing is what I have a question about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8835)|
| 2:27:23| How can we address it in a way that we can get the individual a bill, a reasonable bill, not two for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8843)|
| 2:27:36| What is the difference between a first responder, is what I ask, and an ambulance service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| I think they should be one and the same if you have no fire in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| Now, can we address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| We would have to re-bid it, change the agreement here to where we can address some of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| Do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| Let me ask, Mr. Law Director, if we change this, would we not have to re-bid it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8880)|
| 2:28:05| I mean, change some of the things in here to help some of these indigent kind of care that I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8885)|
| 2:28:12| Our resolution is to extend the contract that you have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8892)|
| 2:28:19| So, if we send it with no recommendation, we cannot address some of these people that are having these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8899)|
| 2:28:26| No, that's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| We will have a meeting next Monday at which anything can come out of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8908)|
| 2:28:35| We will have a meeting next Monday of which anything can come out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| I just want to let, since I can't talk to any commissioners after this meeting is over with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| my concern is with my constituents that are having problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8925)|
| 2:28:51| When you have, I hate to say, but you have this little lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| Commissioner Bussler, the motion that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| I know, but this is what I want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| If we get to that point, I can't talk to any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| No, we're going to talk until it's dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| But how do we address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| We're going to do it Monday also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| Well, can we address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| The issue I'm having is making sure that I don't have some person call me that's worried to death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| that their house is going to be taken away from them because they've got a threat of putting a lien against their house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| if they don't pay the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| That's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| I'm talking about customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8970)|
| 2:29:31| I'm talking about that individual that elected me to come up here and represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| I'm not sure, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| The rural metro is a great company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| I'm talking about the way they handle the billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| That's the big issue of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| And then also the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| I mean, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| And it's like I say, it's hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| If I went to court, you couldn't use it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| But I've had people talk about why they have left rural metro as an EMT trained person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=8996)|
| 2:30:02| And does that affect the service that they give to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| Now, are we going to answer that by pushing it on down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9007)|
| 2:30:12| Are we going to try to answer some of it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| Are we going to say we're going to rebid this and address these issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9014)|
| 2:30:17| Because as of right here, somebody talked about we've got to do it now because of the length of contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| Well, we're not talking about redoing every bit of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| See, on August 27, 2012, the county released the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| And on November 29, 2012, it only took four months to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9032)|
| 2:30:37| Commissioner Bussler, please allow us to discuss the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9037)|
| 2:30:44| I'm just making my point, Mr. Commissioner, Mr. Chair, that I'm trying to represent my people in the best way I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9044)|
| 2:30:53| The motion that is probably before us right now is to substitute a motion which is no recommendation to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9053)|
| 2:31:05| And then we will continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| Is there a discussion of this motion of no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9070)|
| 2:31:20| Mr. Chairman, I'm just trying to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| So does the substitute motion mean as we move to full commission on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9083)|
| 2:31:33| that the resolution will take a vote on the existing language, number 68?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9093)|
| 2:31:41| With no recommendation, we will continue the discussion Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9101)|
| 2:31:47| Is everyone in agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9107)|
| 2:31:48| Mr. Chairman, is that the motion that is before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9108)|
| 2:31:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9113)|
| 2:31:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9114)|
| 2:31:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9115)|
| 2:31:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| One, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| The motion that is before us right now for continued discussion is a no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9121)|
| 2:32:19| He said he would discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| That was my question a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9141)|
| 2:32:26| You voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9146)|
| 2:32:27| It's going to go either up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| But he said he could still discuss the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| He said they could still discuss the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9152)|
| 2:32:35| You can delay it 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9155)|
| 2:32:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| What is the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9157)|
| 2:33:02| The original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9182)|
| 2:33:25| I'm extremely disappointed right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9205)|
| 2:33:42| I make a motion to open the discussion back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9227)|
| 2:33:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9228)|
| 2:33:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| Having unanimously carried, the discussion is now open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| Mr. Law Director, what's the motion that's before us on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| We have no motion at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| There is no motion on the floor at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| Commissioner Andrews, would you renew your motion of no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9245)|
| 2:34:09| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| You can't discuss without a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| You can't discuss it without a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| We just don't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| So make a motion to send without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9258)|
| 2:34:22| and we can continue the discussion without taking a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9262)|
| 2:34:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| The motion that is before us is the language that is in the current agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9267)|
| 2:34:33| no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| Commissioner Thomas, I'm sorry I have allowed you to sit there for several half hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9275)|
| 2:34:42| of not getting to say something on the first time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| I'll bring my questions up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| Thank you, my fellow commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| I'm sorry that it took us this long to get to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9292)|
| 2:34:57| Commission has had meetings of this, that, or the other going on since 3.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9297)|
| 2:35:04| and again at 4 o'clock, and this meeting started at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| The time on the wall right now is 6.54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9309)|
| 2:35:15| At 7.05, I request that you be back in your seat to continue with the business at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9315)|
| 2:35:24| This is to go to the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| It will only take you 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9328)|
| 2:35:34| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| I'm not concerned about the holding companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| Holding companies can invest heavily or they can take away heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| I'm not really concerned about the buyout at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| My question to the law director, this is the last renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| This is it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| So the next time this contract comes up, it has to be revet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| Sorry, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| There is an option for another one more five-year renewal after the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9361)|
| 2:36:06| So there are two five-year renewals possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| This is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| That's very, very important that we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| Again, the hour is 6.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| You can't recess in the middle of a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| You've got to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| Violation of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| I mean, there's no more discussion, so we just take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9387)|
| 2:36:30| All in favor of the motion, it's on the floor of recommending to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9394)|
| 2:36:53| My motion for recess died for the lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9413)|
| 2:36:59| The motion that is before us is the verbiage is written in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9419)|
| 2:37:06| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9426)|
| 2:37:09| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9435)|
| 2:37:21| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| Roll call vote beginning in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9442)|

| 2:37:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| This is to send no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| Pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9455)|
| 2:37:36| The question that has been asked is why are we voting roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9456)|
| 2:37:41| It's because the voice vote was not significant to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9461)|
| 2:37:49| Madam Clerk, if you would please begin the roll call again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9473)|

| 2:40:09| the next one is Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9609)|
| 2:40:15| Okay, so I'm out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| No, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| Where's the Honorable Mayor Burchett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| I'm trying to plow through this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9622)|

| 2:40:35| We have all apparently lived through the eclipse today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9635)|
| 2:40:42| I'd like to say I thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| and appreciate the activities taking place today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| and recognize you for a moment to spread that word around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| I know some of our neighbors had planned on a big crowd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| and it was greatly reduced for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| but I think we doubled our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| I would like to take full credit for that, and I won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9662)|
| 2:41:06| but I would like to commend some folks in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| If they'd just stand up back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| Come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9673)|

| 2:41:22| So you can be on camera, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| They don't want to be on camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| They work for me, Commissioner, so they want to stay over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9689)|
| 2:41:30| The ladies are a little shyer than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9690)|

| 2:41:38| and especially little Jenny Lingenfelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| Little Jenny Lingenfelter actually ran the show on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| She did an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| Somebody asked me, they thanked me for the eclipse party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| and I said, well, actually, God took care of the eclipse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| and Jenny Lingenfelter took care of everything else, and she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| She did a wonderful job, and we owe her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9718)|
| 2:42:06| When will you be having the next one in the next few months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| I was going to say, I've already talked to Mayor O'Hara| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| and I'm allowing her to do the 2018 eclipse party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| so she'll be hosting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9734)|
| 2:42:19| Thank you, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9739)|
| 2:42:20| but just remain standing there for just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| while I run my index finger down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9745)|
| 2:42:26| On Friday, September the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9746)|
| 2:42:32| the 11th annual Senior Citizens Appreciation Picnic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9752)|
| 2:42:38| that's Friday, September the 15th at 1130 John Tarleton Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9758)|
| 2:42:45| at 3201 Division Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| Would you like to put in a plug for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9770)|
| 2:42:52| It gets bigger and bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| There's a sweet little lady I met there a few years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9774)|
| 2:42:57| Her name was Wilma, and she was 99,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| and she told me, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| Timmy, if you will ask me if she made it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| would I come to her 100th birthday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| Well, yesterday she celebrated her 102nd birthday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| and I was at that party as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| and she made sure that I cleared my calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| for her 103rd birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| So there's definitely something to be said for longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| if you come to our annual picnic, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| And actually, Mr. Brantley and her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| I think they went to high school together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| Mr. Chairman, I'll just take my seat after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9808)|
| 2:43:38| I want to move along before the trap door springs open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9818)|
| 2:43:43| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9823)|
| 2:43:46| The next item on the agenda is Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9826)|
| 2:43:51| It's a resolution of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| accepting the new certified tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| based on the reappraisal and establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| of an official tax rate for the physical year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| beginning July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9842)|
| 2:44:11| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9854)|
| 2:44:19| Is there anyone here wishing to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9859)|
| 2:44:25| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9865)|
| 2:44:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9872)|
| 2:44:34| Wait a minute, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| I think we've got to do a roll call for property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| It's Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9879)|
| 2:44:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| That really didn't even matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9882)|
| 2:44:49| Madam Clerk, I'll read one, you read one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9889)|
| 2:44:59| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| urging Chancellor Davenport of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9902)|
| 2:45:06| to opt out of the Staff Facilities Outsourcing Plan Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9906)|
| 2:45:14| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| Yeah, Ms. Gill, you handed us a couple of pieces of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9921)|
| 2:45:25| The State of Tennessee General Assembly paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| We have speakers here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9928)|
| 2:45:29| Do you know when that was written and issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| Yes, go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| Josh Smizer, 1424 Cornelia, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9937)|
| 2:45:42| This letter was issued by the 75 legislators this April, so a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9942)|
| 2:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| And I like this format better where it's signed off on instead of voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9950)|
| 2:45:55| But the letter from the state and the resolution we have are two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9955)|
| 2:46:00| And so if the resolution said the same thing that the letter said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9960)|
| 2:46:08| I want to have no problem with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9968)|
| 2:46:09| but the letter says our reservations include the potential impact of state policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9969)|
| 2:46:16| I think they want to wait until there's a study on this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| Sir, to clarify, the governor and the state purchasing office declined to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9980)|
| 2:46:29| and went ahead with the move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9989)|
| 2:46:30| So, unfortunately, they ignored the will of the legislature on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9990)|
| 2:46:34| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9994)|
| 2:46:35| They ignored the letter or the will of the legislature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| Yes, sir, the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9997)|
| 2:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| I just think getting in the Board of Trustees' lane and the state's lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10000)|
| 2:46:46| and if you wanted to have a letter and have everybody sign it, it would be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10006)|
| 2:46:53| But I think a resolution from a county commission to a state, to a school, I think it separates us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10013)|
| 2:47:02| I think there's people in here that would be, I mean, I assume people would be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10022)|
| 2:47:08| But this is one of those issues that would separate us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| and I would rather it be in the form of a letter with signatures attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| Well, we can hear from additional commissioners regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10035)|
| 2:47:21| Is anyone else wishing to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10041)|
| 2:47:28| I've got a conflict with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10048)|
| 2:47:29| My wife works for the University of Tennessee, so it's likely I'll probably abstain from this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10049)|
| 2:47:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| I guess I kind of agree with Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| Because the Knox County Commission is not the funding body for the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10061)|
| 2:47:48| I think this needs to be either, like he said, a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10068)|
| 2:47:52| and, of course, leave it up to the funding body, which is the Tennessee General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10072)|
| 2:48:00| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10080)|
| 2:48:01| I agree. That's what I was going to talk about, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| It's not our point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10083)|
| 2:48:06| I mean, we're a citizen, you can say that, but I think we should say it in a letter, not in a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10086)|
| 2:48:14| As Commissioner Anders and I have been here for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10094)|
| 2:48:23| we've had problems with this in the past of trying to take a resolution of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10103)|
| 2:48:34| to deal with something that is, and I'll quote Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10114)|
| 2:48:42| not necessarily in our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10122)|
| 2:48:46| This issue is like the Lady Vol's name, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10126)|
| 2:48:53| and I don't know that we mustered up a resolution here on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10133)|
| 2:48:58| It's also like de-annexation, and some commissioners signed a position on de-annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10138)|
| 2:49:09| A long time ago, I may have tried to have said something about the election of the superintendent of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10149)|
| 2:49:20| So, Mr. Chairman, we can just submit a letter and give the option to other commissioners to sign up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10160)|
| 2:49:25| Do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10168)|
| 2:49:33| Wish to say more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| No, so then I'll look at the resolution to change the resolution and remove it from the agenda and then submit a letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10175)|
| 2:49:46| On things where there's not consensus, it really, we went through a period when we first got here that everything, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10186)|
| 2:49:52| somebody would do an NRA thing and it just really divided our commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10192)|
| 2:49:56| So instead of dividing our commission, we chose to do letters and attach signatures instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| because it just, the more unity we have, the better off we are locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| Yeah, I'd just like to say that I think when we start getting into things that we don't have anything to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10206)|
| 2:50:14| as far as being able to make a decision, all it does is, as Commissioner Anders has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10214)|
| 2:50:21| divide us or find reason for other people to divide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10221)|
| 2:50:25| But as citizens, we all want people that are working these jobs to keep these jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10225)|
| 2:50:32| and the services and resources that are bought by these people, bought locally and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10232)|
| 2:50:40| I think that is important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| I think a letter, a phone call, an email, if we knew where to make those phone calls and emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| will carry more weight than us passing a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10252)|
| 2:50:53| And let me say that these are constituents who work for the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10253)|
| 2:50:58| that live in each one of our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| So this isn't about dividing the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| This is about sending a message that we support people in the local economies in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10262)|
| 2:51:08| not only the state of Tennessee, but Knoxville, which each commissioner represents one or more constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10268)|
| 2:51:16| So we'll be happy to do the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10276)|
| 2:51:18| Yeah, I'm not saying this is dividing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| but I mean there's a lot of things that come down the pike that does divide us for really no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10280)|
| 2:51:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10289)|
| 2:51:30| So, Brad, I think if I understand you correctly that you feel it would be best if we did individual letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10290)|
| 2:51:37| No, I think she can dictate the letter and just send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10297)|
| 2:51:42| Similar to what the state, one letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| I think that's more effective than a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10304)|
| 2:51:48| Resolutions generally go in the trash anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10308)|
| 2:51:54| Seeing no further discussion, but the question is you will withdraw the resolution and seek to prepare a letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10314)|
| 2:52:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10324)|
| 2:52:05| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10325)|
| 2:52:06| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| That resolution is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10332)|
| 2:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10336)|
| 2:52:18| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10338)|
| 2:52:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10339)|
| 2:52:20| That's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| That's exactly what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10342)|
| 2:52:31| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10353)|
| 2:52:34| Discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10354)|
| 2:52:37| I think we beat that one to death last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10357)|
| 2:52:44| Yes, that one is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| What's the next item number, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| Discussion of the employee policy handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10370)|
| 2:52:55| Commissioner Nystrom, I know you're knee deep in investigation, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10375)|
| 2:53:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10381)|
| 2:53:02| I've spent some time, and for those in the TV audience and our fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10382)|
| 2:53:08| this summer Commissioner Anders asked several of us to look into our human resources policies, human resources manuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10388)|
| 2:53:16| I spent some time recently just calling our counterparts in Chattanooga, the governments in Chattanooga, Davidson Metro Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10396)|
| 2:53:25| as well as Shelby County to get copies of their policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10405)|
| 2:53:29| and also take a look at their org structures and their offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10409)|
| 2:53:33| I'm still waiting on some information to come in from Davidson County Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10413)|
| 2:53:38| and would like probably with the assistance from Drew and her office to coordinate a meeting of our committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10418)|
| 2:53:45| once I get some of this additional information in to give a further, more detailed update to you at the next, probably September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10425)|
| 2:53:55| But one interesting insight is, at its first glance, we're very similar in our structure with their office to Chattanooga's down in Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10435)|
| 2:54:08| in terms of the timing of our meetings as well as being supported by a staff of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| Davidson County, they've got 40 city folks in that metro government and a staff of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10453)|
| 2:54:20| I'm waiting for all the details on Shelby County, but the aha moment in my first call of research is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10460)|
| 2:54:26| they have a handful of staff members in their commission office that are professional civil service employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10466)|
| 2:54:32| and some that are political appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| So I can imagine how, I would assume that that would probably make the office a little less efficient if you had it set up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10475)|
| 2:54:44| Anyhow, as soon as I get more information, I'll work with Drew to coordinate a meeting with the three of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10484)|
| 2:54:49| We'll review that stuff and give a much greater, more detailed update to my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10489)|
| 2:54:55| And thank you, Chairman Wright, for letting us work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| The discussion item will not be on next Monday's agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10498)|
| 2:55:04| Correct. It should probably be postponed or moved to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10504)|
| 2:55:09| We'll move it to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| I am under the impression that every commissioner has received both of the personnel policies that exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10512)|
| 2:55:21| one for the administration and then the one that we have that is related just to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10521)|
| 2:55:27| Those two need to be, the committee needs to work on where we need to be as it relates to personnel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10527)|
| 2:55:36| And Chattanooga doesn't even have a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| Some of the other folks are just relying on their overall county policy rather than having a separate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| That's a decision that may work for us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10542)|
| 2:55:50| Madam Clerk, are we to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10550)|
| 2:56:00| There are line item transfers. Do I hear a motion to move them to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10560)|
| 2:56:07| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| This was another thing. After you do that, I was going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10572)|
| 2:56:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| Did we vote on the line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10581)|
| 2:56:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10582)|
| 2:56:23| Opposed, no. Motion carries. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| Did we have public forum for this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| No one signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| Yes, we did have a sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10592)|
| 2:56:35| Is public forum still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10597)|
| 2:56:38| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10598)|
| 2:56:39| Unless he's already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| Apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10602)|
| 2:56:48| He earned a merit badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10608)|
| 2:56:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| You're probably ready to shoot us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| You get six minutes instead of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| I just have one my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| Mr. William Hall, 12438 Hickory Creek Road, West Knoxville, Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10620)|
| 2:57:06| Hold the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| How's that? Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| I'm one of three property owners on Hickory Creek Road that are suffering adverse damage from a subdivision across from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10630)|
| 2:57:19| In particular, storm water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| Back in November of last year, and you probably have some documentation and hopefully pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10641)|
| 2:57:27| we had a rather significant mudslide, literally, that cascaded across the road into my property and into my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10647)|
| 2:57:34| which I affectionately call now my downstream neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| Mr. Vandertate and through the Department of Public Works have been very cooperative as far as holding the developer accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10658)|
| 2:57:46| and we've moved into a phase now that I was just surprised that we're speaking of post-construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10666)|
| 2:57:53| So we're actually rolling into a year since the subdivision started, and every rainfall in my yard floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10673)|
| 2:58:00| Initially it was rocks, gravel, and construction debris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| Now it's sediment and clear water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10684)|
| 2:58:07| My concern is post-construction, what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10687)|
| 2:58:11| Is it two months, six months, another year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10691)|
| 2:58:15| Part of that is the roof rainwater runoff and driveways that are located badly, if you will, to a catch basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10695)|
| 2:58:26| That water won't be collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| It will actually rush down the driveway, over the road, cascade once again into my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| So I guess what we're trying to do is get as much exposure as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10713)|
| 2:58:38| and Commissioner Anders, I'm sure you have your hands full with this West Knoxville, Hardin Valley in particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10718)|
| 2:58:45| Again, I was surprised that since 2005 and 2015 the area has increased 108%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10725)|
| 2:58:52| I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| We used to have cows across from my house and horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10733)|
| 2:58:56| Now we have a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| People have to live somewhere, just not near me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10737)|
| 2:59:00| So again, we're just trying to get maximum exposure from the commission so we can work with DPW| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10740)|
| 2:59:06| and maybe the NPC and say these are really adversely affecting property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10746)|
| 2:59:12| I haven't mowed my front yard in months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10752)|
| 2:59:15| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10755)|
| 2:59:16| It's either wet or it's full of gravel, and I'm reluctant to have the developer come in and remove debris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10756)|
| 2:59:22| until he fixes his side of the road first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| So I do have a lot of faith and confidence with Mr. Vandertate and his office to, okay, we've done some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10766)|
| 2:59:32| and the developer has done a few things, but at what point, what does post-construction look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10772)|
| 2:59:39| I don't know that answer, and I don't think anybody does here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10779)|
| 2:59:42| I just don't want to suffer through another two months, six months, a year and a half down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10782)|
| 2:59:47| until 50 or 100 houses are completely finished and my property is further eroded, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10787)|
| 2:59:56| Again, you can see some of the photos on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| You have a printout in a packet as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10799)|
| 3:00:04| Every time it rains, Mr. Vandertate said, you know, the sound of rain at night used to be a soothing effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10804)|
| 3:00:10| Not so much anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| Is Mr. Vandertate still here by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10817)|
| 3:00:18| He can speak certainly more clearly what DPW is doing to resolve this and certainly address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10818)|
| 3:00:23| and they've been, again, very cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| I certainly appreciate their opportunity to come out and speak with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10825)|
| 3:00:28| and many times do site evaluations and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10828)|
| 3:00:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10836)|
| 3:00:37| Just a brief follow-up to Mr. Hall's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10837)|
| 3:00:41| He has been very gracious, as have his neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| We've been working through a number of issues from this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| We have had the State of Tennessee out to the site twice as a backup to our enforcement action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10848)|
| 3:00:55| We have a pending notice of violation against the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10855)|
| 3:01:01| They have filed a notice to appeal, and that appeal has yet to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10861)|
| 3:01:06| But they are continuing to work with us in terms of making modifications to the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10866)|
| 3:01:11| to the property that they control, that we think will make some difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10871)|
| 3:01:15| Mr. Hall alluded to something that I always want to share with this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10875)|
| 3:01:18| particularly as it relates to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| The hardest period of time when we're dealing with these sites is when construction starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10880)|
| 3:01:26| and you have mass grading, and our ordinance allows up to 25 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10886)|
| 3:01:30| As you know, state law allows up to 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| but our ordinance allows up to 25 acres of mass site grading when construction begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10892)|
| 3:01:37| With a summer like this, it is very difficult to manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10897)|
| 3:01:41| and this summer has certainly proven that with the rain events that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10901)|
| 3:01:45| As Mr. Hall noted, Brad Warner and I were comparing notes one morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10905)|
| 3:01:48| and I used to say I'd wake up in the middle of the night and it would be raining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10908)|
