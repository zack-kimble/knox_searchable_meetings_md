| 0:13:52| Vehicles it goes on to state that no partially dismantled wrecked junked or discarded vehicles or vehicles that sit on one or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=832)|

| 0:15:28| 12 years 11 or 12 years later now. We we have a one party who wants to to change that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=928)|

| 0:16:54| Those are not in place forever and ever and ever as they originally set they're adjusted all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| They're amended as uses are needed and I think in the discussion of this I can remember at least four or five different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1019)|

| 0:17:38| Just doesn't seem to make sense to me. I think time and again through this discussion. We've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1058)|

| 0:18:02| And I think with all of the things that the ordinance said that were appropriate that this is appropriate as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1082)|

| 0:19:32| and so I'm kind of torn between the two and I wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| Mr. Green that we could find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| And I don't think we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| To zone the individual that has the business because I think they do take care of that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| Since it's their own and somebody comes in buy something takes it over. They're probably just looking for profits to pay for it. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| All right. Thank You. Mr. Besser. Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1198)|

| 0:20:07| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| All right, thank you Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1210)|

| 0:20:18| I just had a quick question for Gerald. Gerald, on a use-on-review, is there a continuous operation period before that's revoked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1218)|
| 0:20:27| No, not typically we don't put time frames on them. That's just on a grandfathered business. That's good. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| Thank you. Back to you Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Green, didn't you just outline to us that there were several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| use-on-review standards that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| were already in place as part of this ordinance that were different requirements that would require a business firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| Doing all the things that you would you would want a business to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| I mean you just listed those that's part of this ordinance, correct? That's part of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| there are ten standards here addressing everything from the landscaping buffer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| storage overnight to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1268)|

| 0:21:16| So a number of standards that would try again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| I tried to come up with standards that would address all the concerns that I could think of of having this type of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| adjacent to a presidential neighborhood. And what would happen if somebody did not comply with those standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| It would be reported to Code Compliance. They would issue a notice of violation and wouldn't bring them into compliance or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| Punitive action. And to the best of your knowledge if somebody didn't comply with those with the code standards, what would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| They could ultimately lose their license to operate. So this ordinance has ten standards of protection in places for neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1305)|
| 0:21:53| Specifically to mitigate impact on neighborhoods and to represent businesses. It has those safeguards in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| So if somebody is a bad actor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| If they don't follow the rules that they don't follow codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Then they won't be in business ultimately. Correct. And as a use on review each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| Each applicant would be reviewed individually to ensure that they could meet these standards that the it was the appropriate location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| There was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1335)|

| 0:22:20| So if they would have to go through that extra step of the process to make sure that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| You know a good neighbor so to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1345)|

| 0:22:35| Scrutiny so to speak or or thresholds for a business to open this is a higher level much higher level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1355)|

| 0:22:43| this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| It's accurate to say that this is a higher standard and a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Threshold of being a good neighbor than we would apply on any other business in any other zoning. That's correct. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| All right. Thank you. Mr. Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Thank you. Thank you chairman director green just to play off what Commissioner J said, can you tell me about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1379)|
| 0:23:06| Maybe you don't what's CG to zoning CG to is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| General commercial it's in the city new zoning code. It's a equivalent equivalent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| Roughly CA and CB in the county zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| Hence there some design standards more urban in context than CA and CG, but somewhat equivalent to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| So on developing shod Road, could you see something like that being there? Because the reason I'm asking that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| the reason this specific zoning by the city sticks out to me is because this is in the middle of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| neighborhood where I feel like a lot of people know in the 4th district called Sequoia Hills and there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| Maintenance station right smack dab in the middle of it that reminds me a lot of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| Mr. Mullins here is talking about putting in off shod Road. Is that pretty much accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| Actually, the CG is more intense than the scene and this has a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| Protective standards as Commissioner J mentioned in the CG. Oh, so even more in-depth. Okay, that's what I thought. I appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1451)|

| 0:24:22| Thank You. Mr. Chairman, just closing remarks. I guess you can realize why I'm so passionate about this. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| Was involved in this way before I was a county commissioner way before I served six years on the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| This was when I was president of the West Knox County homeowners a lot of the people out in the Choteau community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| did not want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Neighborhood commercial go in there and I was one of the people that said no this makes a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| We need to have some kind of development area next to commercial that provides the services that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| And at that time I thought the the way the NPCs spelled it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| There were plenty of businesses that could that could make it living in that neighborhood commercial and and we shouldn't change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1501)|
| 0:25:09| So that's why I'm opposed to to the motion in front of us. All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| Thank you back to Commissioner Gill and then I'll come back to Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| Thank You. Mr. Chairman, can you tell me this? Did you say the staff recommended approval or denial? I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1518)|

| 0:25:46| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| And one of the reasons PC was not granted was because of lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| And PC is tip as a plain commercial district. That's the purpose is to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| opportunities for large-scale commercial development as opposed to a small site with and and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| The landscapes and restrictions that we've placed on this ordinance. Are they fairly equal to PC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| They are yes, sir, thank you. All right. Thank you back to you Commissioner Anderson. Yeah, that's kind of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1573)|
| 0:26:23| You know, I understand I mean I was on Commission when Choteau Road was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Was was being voted in and I heard the opposition to the Weigels and you know a great great store great corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1587)|

| 0:26:38| Then I think outside of that box I think of North Shore Drive and Hart Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| There's a first-choice automotive smack-dab in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1604)|

| 0:26:57| And I just I just think this makes sense and I think there's more cumbersome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| Allowances on the ordinance than this and I think if if they do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Right with shielding of the lot and and and the sign is a monument sign all the lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1628)|

| 0:27:20| Just like this. I mean, this is a four-lane turn lane four lanes with turn in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| I mean North Shore if it fits North Shore and Hart Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| It should certainly fit right here. And I think it's just a good idea to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| All right. Thank you. And back to you commissioner skin maker just a point of clarification as the law director said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| You know zoning goes with the property that was actually a full commercial zone lot because it was a Weigel store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| Weigel's closed that location to move down to the Chodo markets, which was neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| so the next business that came in it was zoned full full commercial and that's why they were able to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224zoning_202002?start=1673)|
