| 0:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| I'm lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Okay, so Sergeant Coward or Mr. Bird, is there something still outstanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=650)|
| 0:10:57| Yeah, just the inspections, fire and health approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| They'll come, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Do I have a motion to extend for 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Motion to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| All right, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| All right, next item is Lucky Shot Billiards, Sports Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=683)|
| 0:11:33| Kenny Harris, Lucky Shot Billiards, 6021 Chapman Highway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| All right, you want to give us an update on where you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| We're about probably 85% done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| We've still got some plumbing and a filtration system to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| We kind of held up on a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| We've got all our bonds in place to get all that stuff taken care of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| We're just waiting on the permits to be released from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| Okay, so how long are you requesting an extension for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| Probably at least 120 days, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| 90, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| We're definitely going to need another 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=730)|
| 0:12:20| Okay, so in order, well, you'll need to complete another background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| I did that last week already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| Oh, you did already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Yeah, I went last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Okay, so 90 days or 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| Okay, so we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| So 120 days you think will be good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Tommy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| The applicant I've spoken with multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| and he's been through the ringer, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| between some of the permitting hold-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| Some of them were delayed by the city, and then the state got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| TDOT had some hang-ups, so a lot of it, I would say, is outside of his control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| So I would make a motion to approve or extend for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| All right, so is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| All right, good luck with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Okay, on the beer permit, you've got final inspections and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| Do I have to have the plumbing and stuff completed with the permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| before the fire marshals and everything can come in and sign off on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| Mr. Byrne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| I would probably say you'd want to check with those departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| the fire marshal or inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| My guess would be, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| but I'd certainly defer to whatever advice they would give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| All right, Humble Hog is withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| as they apparently are looking for a new location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| and will be reapplying down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| And then Wilson Corner Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| Chair Testament, the owner contacted me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| and they are awaiting their coolers to be delivered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| and requested an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| I'd like to make that a 90-day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| just due to some of the supply chain delivery issues that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| So do I have a motion to extend this for 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| I'll motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Wilson Corner extended for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| All right, we'll now move to our administrative hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| the first being Dollar General Store number 10918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=896)|
| 0:15:17| Name is Daniel McCarley, 33015 Tanya Drive, Palo, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| Before we get started, I would like to ask Mr. Frost to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| this is a little bit of a complicated situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| so I would like for him to help clarify to this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| where we are with Dollar General and somewhat of the back story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| Okay, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| As the Chair indicated, this is an atypical situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| So when a beer permit holder is caught for an underage sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=949)|
| 0:15:58| there's some certain steps by the Bureau of Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| they're supposed to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| One of them is to pay a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| One of them is to submit a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| and that has to be done within a certain number of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| before a meeting such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| Well, unfortunately, Dollar General did neither of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| in a timely manner, and that was one circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| and they since reached an agreement with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| a number of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Well, here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| So they have done their second illegal underage sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| this time within a two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| and unfortunately, again, Dollar General failed to pay their fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| and they failed to submit a remedial plan in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| Mr. Johnson passed around just a minute ago the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| which I believe he indicated they delivered today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| Well, when a beer permit holder either fails to pay their fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| timely or fails to file their remedial plan timely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| the Bureau of Ordinance 4-78 requires the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| to file a noncompliance complaint on the untimely nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| of their activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| The law department has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Today Dollar General is here for a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| If they need to be referred to the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| concerning their second underage sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| in most circumstances a beer permit holder turns in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| their remedial plan in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| It's included in the beer board packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| and the members of the beer board are able to review everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| and then traditionally a representative of the beer permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| appears and explains the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| The members of the beer board listen to that explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| take into account the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| and then you all can do one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| One is take no action, and that ends it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| Or the second thing that can happen is the beer permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| is referred to the hearing officer for a potential fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| and a potential suspension of their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| So tonight, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| you all just now have gotten the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| and tonight you all need to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| whether you all want to accept things as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| and nothing further happens to Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| other than the noncompliance complaint that is presently pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| or if you all wish to refer it on to a hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| as it relates to the second underage sale in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Thank you, Laudrey Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Just receiving this is not adequate time for me to be able to thoroughly review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| I would, however, be interested in hearing as to why we're just receiving this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| and the lack of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| So just to go through the timeline, first of all, through the violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| October 22nd, cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| November 15th of 2021, noncompliance complaint filed by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| December 13th, 2021, agreed order entered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| February 16th was their second violation cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| On 2-17, notice of administrative hearing sent and received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| March 15th was the deadline for filing a revised remedial plan and paying a fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| and on 3-16 of this year, the city recorder referred the matter to the law department once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| So if you could tell us a little bit about where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| We did just receive your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Sort of why on both violations both of these measures have been late in complying with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1228)|
| 0:20:40| Quite honestly, I'm just the district manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| So, like, there's the corporate office and here's me and here's the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| So I'm kind of like the middle man here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| So, like, I didn't sell the beer to the minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| But the guy has since been fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| As far as, you know, sending up all the paperwork that the store receives, you know, I did all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| So I don't know why the corporate office decided to drag their feet to get all this sent in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| But I know we did get another form, which I've passed along, that May 3rd we're going to have a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| I believe, on the Skype or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| I believe that's what you were kind of just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| So as a district manager, can you share a little bit about from the local level sort of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1277)|
| 0:21:27| A, how this happened, how you all are preventing from this happening again and what measures you're taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| Yeah, basically before anybody starts working, they have to take what they call computer-based learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| And that actual gentleman took his training and signed a paper saying that he would not sell beer to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| He would check the I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| It's basically kind of what that second page is on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| They're required to sign that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| And also, like I said, they have to take a CBL, which is like a computer-based learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| where they literally have to sit in front of it and watch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| And the only way they get credit is actually signing it with their own personal employee I.D. number and PIN number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| So it ain't like anybody can get on there and do it for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| So he did watch the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| I mean, I made sure of that first thing right off the bat because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| the first thing we do when we hire people is they've got to take all those classes before they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| especially if they sell beer at the store or tobacco, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Sergeant Howard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Are your stores equipped with cash registers that require date of birth entry before completion of the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1348)|
| 0:22:38| Well, actually, they just started a thing where you have to scan the back of the I.D., the barcode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| But sometimes that barcode doesn't read, so they have to type the number in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| That's what happened in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| He typed in the wrong birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| There is a thing where you type in the birthday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| and I don't know what the guy was thinking when he typed in the wrong birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| So, I mean, I can't speak for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| A couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| I understand that you're in the middle, and that's an awkward position to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| Is there anything different that was done between the first offense and the second offense with the employee training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| Well, honestly, I was not the district manager the first time it happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| and I actually just got that store on, like, February the 2nd to take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| So I only had it maybe for about 12 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| What was it on the 16th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| So 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| I had about two weeks whenever that second occurrence happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Great timing for you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Yeah, perfect timing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| And then, you don't know if there was anything different done with training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| What is different about this remedial plan than is in practice right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| It's pretty much, for the most part, what everybody, you know, it's what we use every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| And like I said, all stores follow pretty much everything on that remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| I mean, I know this happens sometimes, but, I mean, this is only really the second time I've ever been involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1443)|
| 0:24:11| And I've been with the company for, like, 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| So just, you know, one of the things we're just going to continue to drive, you know, the CBL execution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| and just making sure that, you know, check ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| I mean, we actually made some extra signs that were hanging up on every store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| and right there by the register so they can, employees sees it right there by the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| I guess what my concern is, I'm not as, you know, it seems like the first step taken was to fire the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| It's not necessarily the employee that I am worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| It's the training that they're receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| I'm also very concerned that the corporate office has not taken this seriously twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| So to me, I would like to see it move forward with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Before we move forward, can I get your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| I'm not sure we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Daniel McCarley, M-C-C-A-R-L-E-Y, 3315 Tanya Drive, PAL 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1503)|
| 0:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Yeah, I don't know that I'm inclined to take no action, but Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| I just had a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| You said that now the cash registers have a place to scan the barcode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| How recently was that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| I assume it's across the corporate level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| It was around the beginning of the year, around the 1st of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| So that did happen between the first and second occurrence that the dollar general increased their requirements at the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1542)|
| 0:25:55| Yes, they did do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| I understand sometimes those things don't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| but I just wanted us to be clear that that sounded to me like something the corporation did do to make it harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| Yes, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| And they implemented it across the whole chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| I just want to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| One of my concerns here is the actions or inactivity of your corporate office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| and I understand everything you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| I think you are kind of caught in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| The position that puts us in is your corporate office hasn't followed certain rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| and we have timeframes that must be abided by and information that must be submitted to us in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| for us to be able to work with someone who may need a little bit more time or some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1601)|
| 0:26:49| or more opportunity, I guess, to correct situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| But when your corporate office is not following rules that we have, it puts us in a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1614)|
| 0:27:05| So I think, and this is no offense to you, but I think in this particular situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| I would be in favor of referring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| So, and there have already been referred to a hearing for the delay in filing and the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| but I will turn it over to Mr. Frost to lay out our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| I even give Dollar General the benefit of the doubt because, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| I can't remember somebody not following the timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| I've been doing this 18 or 19 years, not following the guidelines twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| I called Mr. Johnson and made sure that everything was going to the right address on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| Unfortunately, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| So if the beer board decides to pass this along to the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1669)|
| 0:27:57| and ask the law department to file a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| the law department would like some sort of guidance from the beer board in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| I think the law department should try to seek one of three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| Actually, I guess one of three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Suspension of the permit, or a monetary fine, or revoking the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| or you could do a combination of suspension and fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Council Member Thomas, did you have, I know your light was on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| So, Law Director, what I would like to see happen, and, sir, I agree with my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| this is by no means a reflection on your capabilities to manage your stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| This is absolutely sitting squarely with your corporate office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| I'd like to see some type of monetary fine and temporary suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1734)|
| 0:29:03| because if there's been absolutely no communication back from that corporate office, that is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| And I'm certain that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| this gentleman will probably give his corporate office a heads-up of what's coming their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| But absolutely, I don't think that, I think anything less at this point when there have been two offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1758)|
| 0:29:26| which, you know, we can't afford to see a third one when we're talking about potential sales to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| and we don't know which ones were not caught potentially as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| So that would be my recommendation, and I'd like to put that motion out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| if this is the appropriate time and there's no additional conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| So we have a motion on the floor to refer to a hearing officer for additional fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| and additional suspension on top of what may be remanded in the original hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1792)|
| 0:30:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Council member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| I would 100% agree with my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| and I think this definitely deserves some type of fine as well as some type of suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| for not following the rules and not responding in a timely manner, not once but twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1816)|
| 0:30:25| And if I heard Mr. Frost correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| he was struggling to find an instance where something like that had happened in quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| So I think to reinforce our rules, I think we have to take that action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| So I would second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| So with that, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Council member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| And I think, sir, what you've heard is that we take this very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| and obviously two violations within a four-month period is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| So, again, I'm sorry that you're caught in the middle and that we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| But I think so we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Next is Fountain City Exxon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1885)|
| 0:31:36| Does anybody here from Fountain City Exxon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1896)|
| 0:31:51| Well, they're the last thing on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| So I guess one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| You can postpone them until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| or you could send them on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| They have a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| This agenda is snake bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| These people, they sent in something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| but I think they fed it through the machine wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| Because what was sent in, they sent in blank paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| I'm sure it's probably on the other side of the paper, their remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| We did receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| I brought their attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| They sent it just the very next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Well, then you can postpone, hear what they have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| or you can accept what they've turned in and that I totally missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| and I apologize for, or you can send them on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I'm inclined to postpone for a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| I'm not sure why they're not here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| but they have attempted to send in a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| and I see that they have paid a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| The fine has been paid, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| So they've made some effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| and without knowing the circumstances about why they're not here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| I would move to postpone for a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| I'd like to pose this question to Mr. Cowan and potentially, no, Mr. Byrd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| Cowan and Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| What communication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| I see there was a letter that was sent to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Was it certified mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| Did they have to sign for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Has anyone received a phone call stating why they would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| the circumstances around why they would not be able to be present today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| No, I have not had any communication with them directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| They mailed the check to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| The notice of the hearing was sent to them, certified mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| and they signed for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| It was also served on them by Sergeant Coward or, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| someone from the inspections office, physically served on the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| and they emailed Sergeant Coward the remedial plan last Tuesday, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| So when you say that they were served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| were they served with a document that stated that they had a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| scheduled for today in the town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Yes, it's this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| That was what they were served with, and it was personally put in someone's hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2062)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| I'm just picking up where Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| I feel that if they were very aware of this hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| I would like to make a motion to move it on to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2080)|
| 0:34:55| Well, Mr. Smith made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Was it seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| No one seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| So there's no motion seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| I'll second Council Member Thomas' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| So the motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| the initial motion is to postpone to the April beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| to give them an opportunity to be here and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| We've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| I certainly understand my colleague's alternative motion, let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| I guess I'm just a little bit uncomfortable without knowing some circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| and the fact that they have made efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| They've paid a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| They've attempted to send something in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Obviously, they should have received notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| so I guess I'm just thinking of giving them to the benefit of the doubt for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| so we can review this, but I do understand my colleague's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| They did receive notice, Officer Taylor, from my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| hand-delivered notice to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| I think what we have is an issue of not following directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| because they sent me the remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| when the letter clearly states all that is to go to Mr. Johnson in the recorder's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| That's just my theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| but I guess I'm wondering what if some circumstances beyond their control happened today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| which prohibited them from being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| So we have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| I'd like to make one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| I didn't understand that you had made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| I didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| But I do want to put in that if someone doesn't show up for court, it's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| I want to make sure that people are taking this seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| and that's where my motivation comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| The motion on the floor is the one to postpone for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| and it's a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| So I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| No more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| I might need a roll call vote on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Are we voting to postpone for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| And Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2299)|
| 0:38:38| Taking no action, since they did turn in the remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| and they did pay their fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| that's what I call go forth and send no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| You all are satisfied with what's transpired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| That's taking no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| If you need to, you all, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| need to decide if they need to come back at a beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| or if you need to send them on to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I mean, it's an unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Council Member Riders had a health issue come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| Otherwise, I'm sure she'd be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| But here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| So at this point, it is to Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| I would just add a comment that this body's, if I recall correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| multiple occasions have postponed applicants for 30 days when they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| show and no notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| So that's been my experience since being on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| And I don't feel comfortable sending them for revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| I hear and appreciate comments made by Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| My experience is that for the most part our extensions have been for beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| permit, but not necessarily for the actual hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| And I have similar concerns as my colleagues that the process is not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| And so I believe that we could send this to the public officer with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2418)|
| 0:40:28| instructions, that this does not have to necessarily lead to a revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| But at minimum, a fine should be imposed so that individuals do take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| process seriously and do not, you know, decide to not show up at a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| that they're fully aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| So I make a motion that we send the issue to the public officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| So we have a motion on the floor right now to refer this to a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| or revocation hearing with the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| Got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Is the recommendation to go to a hearing officer just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| or is it with the recommendation that you mentioned about a fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| It's just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| I just wanted to be clear on what I'm voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Yeah, I have a question, Mr. Frost, just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| The motion to postpone failed as a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| So is the options left to us to take no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| or to forward on to the hearing officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| Is that the options left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| I mean, you know, before your board member Parker made her motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| if someone made another motion to postpone them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| I was going to suggest that since that had just failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| that would be improper to make it immediately on the heels of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| and that we would need another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| But Council Member Parker's motion beat me to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| So, you know, eventually someone's going to need to reconsider at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| I'll leave that up to you all, or we can be here for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| Well, if the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| And I'm looking for other suggestions if anyone has them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| If the option is to take no action or to submit it to the hearing officer for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2558)|
| 0:42:49| the second option appeals to me more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| I don't think we're in a position where we can just do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| So I had a mild preference to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| But if we, you know, if it was a tie, then I am willing to consider the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2577)|
| 0:43:07| You know, Ma'am, I also just want to clarify for the group that I was a yes vote on the last motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| And so this motion to send to the public officer hearing is me switching my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| Versus no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| So I've got a Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| So, point of clarification, going to the hearing officer does not mean an automatic fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| They have paid a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| I would suspect that the law department would not seek what I would characterize as substantial fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2617)|
| 0:43:48| I would also maybe tend to doubt that they would seek much of a suspension, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2628)|
| 0:43:59| Council Member Buget had mentioned that, you know, who's to say that potentially someone wasn't on their way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| and something bad occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| And if that's the case, I'm sure they would be able to give that statement to the hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| if, in fact, that were the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Or someone's going to have a phone message in the morning related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| But, again, you know, this is serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| And so the fact that they did receive it, they were actually, it was hand-delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| It is not our responsibility if someone does not read it thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| And so, and, again, another point of clarification is I do not recall ever voting on delaying a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2672)|
| 0:44:44| that someone just did not show up with no communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| If they have communicated with the board chair, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Burt, Mr. Cowan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| that's been a different set of circumstances, but zero communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| To my knowledge, we've never had that, or at least I've never consented on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Just to refresh, Sergeant Coward, what communication have they made since, ahead of today, since the notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2704)|
| 0:45:15| The only communication I've had with them was to make them aware that they did not get their remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2715)|
| 0:45:24| scanned in and sent to me properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| And they did respond and submit it properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Yes, they responded the very next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| It was later in the day when I received it on the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| I had already gone home, so I did not respond to the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| And they did submit the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| They did pay the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| The fine was paid, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| So there's two actions that they've taken to show some responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| And in full grace, I would suggest typically the district representative liaises with an applicant in any circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2752)|
| 0:46:03| and that council member is not here, don't know what conversation has been had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| but in full disclosure, that's typically what happens as a lot of district representatives will know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| that we take ownership of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Again, we're not responsible for inaction of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| but I do think that this applicant has shown that they've tried to do certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| and without knowing what happened today, I won't be supporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Mr. Smith brought up an obvious point that escaped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| The council person that represents that district is not here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| and I would really like to have her input on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| So I don't think we would be amiss in responding to it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| So I've kind of gone back and forth on this, I know, because both of these are valid points on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2809)|
| 0:46:59| But I guess it does bother me that Council Member Ryder is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| and she would be the tie-breaking vote on another four to four votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| So I guess after hearing more of my colleagues' discussion, I'm going to be implying not to favor today's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2831)|
| 0:47:22| Sergeant Cower, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| So they were delivered in person a notice advising them of today's meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| What day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| It's on the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| but I don't believe that English is the owner's first language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| That might be a bit of an issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| All right, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| So help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| I'm inclined to go ahead and send it to the hearing officer because rules are rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| and we expect people to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| What's the worst thing that can happen when you go to the hearing officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| I mean, it basically just says you should have come here, you didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| You go to the hearing officer, you paid your fine, you've got a remediation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| and they may do nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| The absolute worst thing that a hearing officer could impose, worst punishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| would be a revocation, which revocation means that permit is revoked permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2912)|
| 0:48:42| So I would like to offer a friendly amendment to the motion to see if we can all come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| and make that recommendation to the hearing officer that despite a revocation not be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2930)|
| 0:49:04| or that we ask that they look favorably upon this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| We're going to get to a 4-4 again maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| Or maybe a 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| I'll just call for a question now about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| One way to look at it would be the permitee has put forth effort to do what he is supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2956)|
| 0:49:26| However, not every single step was followed, quite obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2966)|
| 0:49:34| Like I said, I believe that the permittee just really did not thoroughly read the instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2974)|
| 0:49:43| Otherwise, it would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| So this is where I'm struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| I get what everybody says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| But there are rules in life, and going to court and going to hearings are one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=2991)|
| 0:50:00| And I will say, I think if Councilman Ryder had been contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| she would have told somebody, the chair, that if she's not going to be at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| hey, my people contacted me and they're not going to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| That's all speculation, but that's usually what I would think it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| So do we want to talk about this some more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| I was going to ask Mr. Frost to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| I checked with Mr. Johnson, and the cost for the hearing officer is either $350 or $375,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| with which they would be taxed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| And I would anticipate there would be some sort of fine on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| I mean, I'm not trying to predict the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| but I would not think that this rises to the level where they would have their beer permit suspended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| let alone revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| I would drop over if it was revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| I do not think the law department would ask for a revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| What I would anticipate is they would be paying the cost of the hearing officer, again, $350 or $375,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3066)|
| 0:51:17| and maybe $250, $300, $400 fine on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| That's a guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| I'm going to vote for the referral for a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| I didn't vote that way the first time out of respect for the fact that the district representative wasn't here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| and that something else could have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| But I do think it's a close call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| and so I definitely think that given that that postponement failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| I think it's reasonable to send on for the revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| I would recommend, though, that the fine that's considered be consistent with court costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| maybe if there's some other additional costs in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| because I think that satisfies the discussion that we've had today about respect for the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| but then also you need to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| If you don't, I'm looking at the notice right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| It tells them very clearly what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| So that's what I would suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| And I think our motion is just to do the referral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| We're just adding some commentary so that when the hearing officer looks at it, they know what we were thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3148)|
| 0:52:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| And with all due respect to my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| all of us take our responsibilities very seriously as we represent our districts and at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| And just like a conversation I had with Chair Testament earlier where I was not feeling well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| and didn't think that I was going to make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| but I communicated information for a company in my district that was not able to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| and I know that Council Member Ryder would have done the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| if she's able to call in and say she's not going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| So with that said, again, I agree with my colleagues as it relates to the rules are here for a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| and I don't see that this is one where they have put forth the good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| they've followed two of the steps, but you have to follow all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| And I don't want us to start setting a precedent as it relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| So because of that, I'll be supporting the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220322?start=3208)|
