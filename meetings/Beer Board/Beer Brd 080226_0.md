| 0:01:07| What do you all have coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| Fiona, do you want to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| There's all kinds of stuff at the Tennessee Theater and the BGU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| What's the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Come tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| Somebody come to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| What about Sundown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| Sundown lineup will be announced in a couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| We've got it under wraps right now, but we've got a lot of great lineup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| I think you're going to continue to see the same level of enthusiasm for it when it's released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=91)|
| 0:01:38| So we'll let you know as soon as we've got it final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| We've got a few things still outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=100)|

| 0:01:54| Rob and the Frosties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| They had to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=119)|

| 0:02:18| Blue Elephant Thai Cuisine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| Let's move it to the back of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| I would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| I kind of checked on that, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| I just talked to every gentleman in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| I heard nothing from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| But I think that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| I don't know how to handle this, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| I should have asked someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| I think it's going to be a postponement that will probably last until late summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| There is a lease issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| And I don't think Mr. Cassano or anyone is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| And apparently he has not notified the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| But he indicated to me that he would be in touch with the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| and notify them that the Blue Elephant will not be heard until late summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| Do you want to do a 120-day postponement or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| You know, I guess we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| I think 120 isn't quite adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| But then we can get better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| I thought perhaps that he had contacted the office this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| I move a 120-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| And when will that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Could I offer a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Could I offer a suggestion rather than moving 120 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| That may not fall on a billboard meeting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| Why don't we just say to the regularly scheduled billboard meeting in whatever month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| Could we move it to the regularly scheduled billboard meeting in June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| That would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=235)|

| 0:05:27| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=328)|

| 0:05:37| Mr. Cullen-Knights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=337)|
| 0:05:49| I'm Joe Leavitt, 825 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| I represent the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| She's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| We're waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning, and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=366)|
| 0:06:15| Final what tax return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| Business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Now, I don't know how we can be held responsible for whatever the prior licensee did with respect to taxes or that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=381)|
| 0:06:36| That's a requirement for a beer permit, and everybody else seems to manage to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| So I think you can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| It should just be something that you have to do before you get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| Counselman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Mr. Leavitt, on Brenda Lane's application, she disclosed something getting not bound over to the grand jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=408)|
| 0:06:57| What was the alleged problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| I believe you have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| It may or may not be in your file of the traffic charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| I went over that with Ms. Swann just a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| Let me pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| DUI 9-07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=444)|
| 0:07:34| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Basically, it was a DUI, but they're a first-time DUI here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=457)|
| 0:07:52| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| First-time DUI, failure to provide evidence of compliance with financial responsibility law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=477)|
| 0:08:06| and a roadway lane violation, which was the reason for the stop weaving in the lane apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=486)|
| 0:08:16| Is the applicant here, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| He was a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Yeah, come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=501)|
| 0:08:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| I was just wondering if you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Counselman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Yeah, I've got two questions of some concerns that people have raised with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| One is just ownership issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| And on your application, you all actually state that Brenda Lane owns 96% of this and a Brian Wade owns 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| Just to be clear, there's nobody else that owns any part of this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| The second question I've got is what's the situation with the current beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| Because there's the other thing I heard is that there's a current beer permit owner who does not plan to give up the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| Well, I brought it up to Mrs. Day, up to her office because he doesn't, I don't know why he won't sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| And then Brian went to her office and picked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| I didn't know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| He's on his way up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| He's an anesthesiologist and he had to work all night and he overslept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| So you all actually have the beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| We have that piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080226?start=573)|
