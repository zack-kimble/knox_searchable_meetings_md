| 2:32:19| We make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| But your staff isn't going to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| So the only opportunity for the MPC staff to interject themselves into a development plan is if it's already zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9143)|
| 2:32:31| planned residential or planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| Mark, what about in talking about the hillside protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9159)|
| 2:32:48| how does your transfer development rights figure into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9168)|
| 2:32:53| We don't have a transfer development rights policy or regulation in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| Within any approved planned residential district, landowners have the right to move density around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9178)|
| 2:33:07| within that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| And it is the recommendation of the plan, the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| to move density to the flatter portions of any planned residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9194)|
| 2:33:22| thereby preserving the more steeply sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| That's a fairly consistent principle that we've been using for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| And it's incorporated into both the hillside and ridgetop protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| and the south county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| Do you have a copy of that verbiage you were talking about, that paragraph that relates to the hilltop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9222)|
| 2:33:50| Mike would have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| If we amend this motion to say that that paragraph will be advisory only, that satisfy you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9234)|
| 2:34:11| We have to, if I'm not mistaken, if you amend this, it has to go back before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| and then brought back before us as a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| The job of the legislative body tonight is to either approve or not approve this to make it operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9261)|
| 2:34:29| If you want to amend it, you can initiate your own amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9269)|
| 2:34:33| And we could start with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| But it would take a create a process that takes it back to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9275)|
| 2:34:41| But I think Mike was thinking you were referring to the Briggs Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9281)|
| 2:34:45| And I was referring to the language that we have within the plan as far as tying it to the recommendations of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9285)|
| 2:34:53| hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| And that language is on page 27, if you have the opportunity to go to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9296)|
| 2:35:01| It's the same percentages that you saw in the hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9301)|
| 2:35:09| And as Mark says, if we got a zoning change in, we would look at the slope groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9309)|
| 2:35:14| and assign the densities based on two dwelling units per acre and a 15 to 25 percent slope group, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9314)|
| 2:35:23| And we've been doing that since the late 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9323)|
| 2:35:28| So those figures have not changed with the last go-around we had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| And they didn't change when you adopted the north county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| Anything else, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| You want to speak on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| We have a motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9343)|

| 2:36:24| Commissioner Shouse votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9387)|

| 2:36:31| You vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| Motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| Five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9397)|
| 2:36:38| Motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9398)|
| 2:36:39| Five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9399)|
| 2:36:42| Next item clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9402)|
| 2:36:46| So what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9406)|
| 2:36:47| We've got to bring this back up again next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| Does it come from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9410)|
| 2:36:51| It'll have to come from MPC unless the board wants to initiate its own amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9411)|
| 2:36:58| So if it comes back to you, it'll come back from MPC at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9418)|
| 2:37:05| If we could, pardon me, I didn't have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9427)|
| 2:37:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| The folks who are here in support of this, could you kind of go through the process because I know I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9429)|
| 2:37:15| They may not be, but I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| But could you explain now what happens at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9436)|
| 2:37:19| The fact that it's failed, so basically this document will not go into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9439)|
| 2:37:26| It will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9446)|
| 2:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| So what happens now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9448)|
| 2:37:30| Well, it's up to the county commission or to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| Sector plan amendments can initiate in one of those two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9454)|
| 2:37:38| If the county commission wants to take this up and initiate its own plan, then that can appear on the agenda next month for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9458)|
| 2:37:45| If MPC wants to do that, they can consider it and pass the same version or a different version at its next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9465)|
| 2:37:55| subject to its notice requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| And it will filter back through to the county commission at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9477)|
| 2:38:04| But at this point, none of that's guaranteed to happen because there needs to be a subsequent action of one of the two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9484)|
| 2:38:11| Can I make another motion on this subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| Well, this is one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| This is where I'm a bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9496)|
| 2:38:17| We keep talking about, okay, we need to initiate our own plan if we do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9497)|
| 2:38:23| We're not really set up to do that, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| I mean, as a body, I mean, yes, we're supposed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9505)|
| 2:38:28| But as far as the mechanism, how do we as a body initiate our own plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9508)|
| 2:38:33| Do we have a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9513)|
| 2:38:34| Do we have a forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9514)|
| 2:38:35| Do we form a task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| Because if we're charged with coming up with our own plan, how do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9517)|
| 2:38:44| Well, if you'll remember, in October, the commission initiated a sector plan amendment with respect to property of Jack Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9524)|
| 2:38:54| And there was a flag lot, and the MPC came to us and said, we're going to recommend a sector plan amendment for part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9534)|
| 2:39:03| And the applicant, Mr. Walker, wanted the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9543)|
| 2:39:08| And there was a disagreement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| And the county commission said, okay, we'll give the applicant what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9550)|
| 2:39:13| And we will initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| And that's currently with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9555)|
| 2:39:18| It will be back here in December, I imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| Well, it will be on our agenda in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9562)|
| 2:39:26| Right, it will be on MPC's agenda in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| And there's a process in the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| The county commission can initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| It goes to MPC for consideration and action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| And it will be back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| That has to take place within 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| And then it comes back to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| It requires a vote before it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| But basically, we say, here's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| And we send it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9587)|
| 2:39:48| And they draft it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9588)|
| 2:39:49| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9589)|
| 2:39:50| They can disapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9590)|
| 2:39:51| They can approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| They can make no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| But one way or another, it will have to come back to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| And then the county commission can, notwithstanding what MPC does at that point, can adopt it and it becomes operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9598)|
| 2:40:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9606)|
| 2:40:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9607)|
| 2:40:08| So, you know, I guess I'm addressing this to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9608)|
| 2:40:12| So, hopefully Commissioner Brown will do something that will be more pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| But as it stands today, so we did not pass this update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| Does it change one iota in terms of the hilltop and ridgeline development that a person can do today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9624)|
| 2:40:33| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| I know everybody wants to make a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| But they can do whatever they want to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| And I know, you know, we've got our developers that, you know, we've made promises to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| But, golly, I mean, this is an update to a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| If what we're arguing about can be done today, what we're, you know, not doing is doing a proper update of some things that are really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9650)|
| 2:40:59| This has nothing to do with how we develop our ridgelines and hillsides and steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9659)|
| 2:41:06| So, again, I hope Commissioner Brown can do something that's a little more pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9666)|
| 2:41:11| I'm sure, you know, if nothing else fails, if we have the votes now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9671)|
| 2:41:18| and there will be a couple of other commissioners back next month or on January, we can bring this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| But we have to have sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| We have to have standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| And to, you know, throw out this amendment or throw out this update because something that doesn't even apply, it doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9692)|
| 2:41:44| As worse, I didn't like that I voted against last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| But what we're doing now, we can do the same thing with or without this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9707)|
| 2:41:52| So we're not addressing the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9714)|
| 2:41:55| And I know we got lines in the sand that we've drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| But in this one, this particular instance, not approving this, to me, just, it doesn't get you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9718)|
| 2:42:05| It doesn't get you where you want it to be or make whatever statement that you want because they can do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9725)|
| 2:42:10| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| As far as bringing it back up to vote, Sam, it would have to come from the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| And that would be kind of hard to do, I'm assuming, in this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| I don't understand it myself why that there is opposition to it except the fact that the hillside ridgetop issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9747)|
| 2:42:40| If we send it back to MPC with a request that this be advisory only and let them do that and come back to us, is that going to satisfy people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9760)|
| 2:42:57| That's a new question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| Yeah, well, I mean, you know, as soon as we voted that as advisory, we started seeing ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9778)|
| 2:43:04| and documents and things being attempted to be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9784)|
| 2:43:08| And, you know, if it's advisory only, it shouldn't be in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| And it should be, you know, in my opinion, when I voted for advisory only, it should be sitting up there as a tool for mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9792)|
| 2:43:19| for planning and developers to come together with the MPC Commission to talk about and discuss ways to properly do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9799)|
| 2:43:32| You know, that was the crux of the amendment was to make it advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9812)|
| 2:43:39| And ever since it's been advisory only, we've seen something on the MPC agenda that had to do with zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| or ordinances that come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| And I just think that I don't feel comfortable with it being in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9827)|
| 2:43:54| I mean, you know, your vote in January is going to totally change because Amy and Tony will be here or in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9834)|
| 2:44:02| It's just when the Commission as a legislative body, whether you win or lose, an issue to keep bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9842)|
| 2:44:10| And, you know, the MPC had a plan that they presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9850)|
| 2:44:14| We compromised on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| So every time there's a zoning issue or a sector plan, that compromise is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| And it's not advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| It's part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| And I think it should be advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| That's the way we voted for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| It's not personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| It's not what Sam is saying, my accountability to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| It is what I voted last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| And I'm not going to vote for a compromise and then vote for sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9873)|
| 2:44:37| I voted against all the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| I just happened to, you know, lose all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| I think the last one was my sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| I lost it 11 to 1 or 10 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| I don't mind that, but I'm not going to vote for something as advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9886)|
| 2:44:49| and then find it in the plan that I'm voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9889)|
| 2:44:52| I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| Anything else, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9897)|
| 2:45:00| So, Mr. Law Department, I can make that as a motion that we send it back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9900)|
| 2:45:06| and make that an advisory only option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9906)|
| 2:45:10| We've already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| I believe that he can initiate a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| I mean, we did it last month on Mr. Walker's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| I mean, I think we did the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| We voted it down and then initiated a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| I'm just not comfortable with the wording being in there that it becomes part of all the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9924)|
| 2:45:30| And then that's, you know, it won't be a state law or two here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| and then we won't have any power to overturn or change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9933)|
| 2:45:39| There's already too many questions about what power we have over MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| And this creates more to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| Who said I couldn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9946)|
| 2:45:52| We have already voted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| It's already been voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| How can we vote again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| In fact, I don't know if this is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| I think the vote's been cast and we're discussing things that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9959)|
| 2:46:03| We need to move on, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| Next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9966)|
| 2:46:11| It's clear that you can initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| There is a question about the procedure by which to do that since the vote's already been cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9974)|
| 2:46:19| Does it need to come back before you next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9979)|
| 2:46:22| Or is there a procedure that that can do it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9982)|
| 2:46:26| And I'll defer to the law director on the procedure that this body can use to do that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9986)|
| 2:46:36| if it's appropriate to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| The same thing that Commissioner Anders talked about last time when you turned down the initial flag lot thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10000)|
| 2:46:47| and then you sent to MPC the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10007)|
| 2:46:51| You decided to send one to MPC as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10011)|
| 2:46:57| And so if it's been voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| Commissioner Brown wants to make a motion to send, as I understand it, this plan back to MPC for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10020)|
| 2:47:09| because you can initiate a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10029)|
| 2:47:12| And with the wording, as you said, that it's advisory only or however you want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10032)|
| 2:47:18| I think you can do it just like you did on the flag lot thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| So, yes, I think it's valid for Commissioner Brown to make that motion to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10041)|
| 2:47:27| And then if there's a second and a vote, it goes back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| Does that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| Doesn't it have to be on the prevailing side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10055)|
| 2:47:36| No, it doesn't have to be prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| It's a whole new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| It's a whole new motion to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10059)|
| 2:47:43| Different issue now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| Different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| The other one's voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10066)|
| 2:47:47| It's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10067)|
| 2:47:48| Now, you want to send one back saying, I like what's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10068)|
| 2:47:52| except I want to take out and make this simply advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10072)|
| 2:47:56| You want to change the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10076)|
| 2:47:57| So that's a whole new sector plan amendment initiated by this body if it's seconded and passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10077)|
| 2:48:04| And I think that's legitimate for this body to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10084)|
| 2:48:08| Mr. Law Director, that will take eight votes to get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10088)|
| 2:48:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10092)|
| 2:48:13| Or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10093)|
| 2:48:14| Your motion takes six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10094)|
| 2:48:15| We'll have to get it on the agenda first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| I was going to say, I think, point of order, I think we're out of order, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10097)|
| 2:48:22| I think there's an agenda that's been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| Now, we're changing the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| I actually think on the previous one, I don't know if there was a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10106)|
| 2:48:30| when we went back to the original, but I do not think this is proper for us to enter an action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10110)|
| 2:48:36| And I'm wanting some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| I think we need to bring the exact same sector plan back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| But I think once we've set this agenda for us to come midstream to add items, I don't think it's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10120)|
| 2:48:50| It's proper tonight as it was last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| I'm having an issue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| I don't, you know, I'm just having a real problem that something is voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| and then all of a sudden we're saying, well, but let's vote on something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10139)|
| 2:49:03| I mean, it's not on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10143)|
| 2:49:03| If we want to suspend the rules to add something, I think that that might be the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| I am not comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10147)|
| 2:49:11| So, anyway, just to put that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| Request that the Metropolitan Planning Commission for Northwest City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| amend it from LDR low-density residential to C commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| located southwest side of Primus Road northwest of Murray Drive in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10167)|
| 2:49:34| Did I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10178)|
| 2:49:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| Property first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10181)|
| 2:49:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10185)|
| 2:49:48| We were the MPC was the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| Who was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10192)|
| 2:49:53| MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10193)|
| 2:49:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10194)|
| 2:49:55| And there's no opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10199)|
| 2:50:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10200)|
| 2:50:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10201)|
| 2:50:05| Anything else, clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| I'd like to request that item be put on the agenda for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10209)|
| 2:50:22| We could go back over this and suspend the rules and start all over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| but I'm going to put it on the floor tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10225)|
| 2:50:31| On page 14, amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=10231)|
