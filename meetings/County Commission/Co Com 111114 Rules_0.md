| 0:00:00| Let's call the rules committee to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| Commissioner McKenzie is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=3)|
| 0:00:04| Commissioner Olinby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=4)|
| 0:00:05| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=5)|
| 0:00:06| Commissioner Royals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=6)|
| 0:00:07| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=7)|
| 0:00:08| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=8)|
| 0:00:09| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=9)|
| 0:00:10| Commissioner Andrews is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=10)|
| 0:00:11| We have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=11)|
| 0:00:12| What we're going to do is consider the amendment to the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| I said we were going to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=17)|
| 0:00:18| Changing the rules, the Knox County Commission added the following language, section X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=18)|
| 0:00:22| Commission called meeting any commissioner desires of a meeting with a fellow commissioner at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=22)|
| 0:00:27| and the place regularly scheduled public meetings shall occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=27)|
| 0:00:30| Meeting is publicly noticed to the commission office at least 48 hours prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| All meetings shall be open to the public, contain a written agenda and minutes kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| and made available for inspection by the members of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| The only amendment to this rule would be the 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| Everything else is in keeping with what we've already been required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=50)|
| 0:00:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| I'm going to get on the discussion there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| Commissioner Royals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| Yeah, I do have some questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=60)|
| 0:01:07| I've got a preview at lunchtime about what John's put together for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=67)|
| 0:01:14| which I think everybody's got a copy of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| Does everybody have a copy of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Everybody on the committee has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| I think there's some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Which I think is brilliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| It's got your picture on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| Doesn't I look young in this picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| It's in Latin or German.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| But one of the issues that I have with this is saying that everything has to be noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=90)|
| 0:01:39| through the commission office because that's 9 to 5, Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| And we all know, in fact, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| you've said yourself many times that being a commissioner is a 24-hour a day, 7-day a week job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| So there may be times that we need to notice things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| especially if we're going to meet a 48-hour requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| We may need to notice things outside of regular office hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| And this would give us an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| So I'd like to either have that stricken, that it has to be noticed through the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| or that we add through the commission office or on the Knox County intranet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| I would, Joe, you've seen this briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| Would you determine that that intranet or noticing it where a commissioner can do the self-notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| would you consider that through the commission office since it's on our webpage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Or would you prefer a different language to the rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| Well, Commissioner, members of the commission or committee, you know, again, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| the challenge here, of course, as we've mentioned before, that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| there's precious little guidance as to what considers a reasonable notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| If this goes through the intranet and it doesn't have, on the general public, doesn't have the ability to access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| I mean, it goes to the, when it goes, a commissioner puts it in through the intranet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| and it goes public to the website and to e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Then that kind of direct contact would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| Is it, would this, would we need to change the wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| The wording says through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| Would this be considered through the commission office since it's on our website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| Just because Joe Lee didn't type it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| No, I mean, if it, I mean, a commissioner is accessing this directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Yeah, then, no, it wouldn't be through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| This would be a direct access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| So you may want to put through the commission office or, you know, depending on the scenario you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| Electronic means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Electronic or electronic means, through the commission office or electronic means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Or I would say other, you know, appropriate because under Tennessee Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| this whole intranet is an exception to the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| So I would be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| I would actually specify through the county's intranet because that is one of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| what you'd want to avoid is trying to do any kind of direct communication that doesn't meet the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| If this is linked to the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| Microphone, sweetie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| I'm pretty loud anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| If this is linked to the website, this is just a means of putting it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=257)|
| 0:04:25| We're saying that any other means, either through the commission office or other means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| if it's on the website, then that's public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| I mean, it's going to be on there and it's going to be emailed to everybody that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Yeah, we're just trying to make sure that we got it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Yeah, I'm saying if we put other means, then it should cover every aspect of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| Yeah, I just want to make sure it's, you know, approved or appropriate means is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| Because, again, this whole, the only reason the intranet came about, or this ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| and your list serve or your system of communicating was as a result of a change in Tennessee code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| John, are you going to hook that in or are you just working on another computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Were you hooking that in or are you just working on that computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| I was just helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| What this, quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| I can explain that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| If you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| If this is really put together in three steps, the commissioner would log in to their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| through the Knox County intranet with their secure password.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| They would then see that first page that you have that would allow them from a drop-down to be able to select their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| And it would also have, through that drop-down, an opportunity for Jolie to do the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| in case she was publishing something from the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| There is a place there for the date and time of the event, a title for the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| and a very short narrative of what the event is, the details that you would enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| After you hit submit, if you'll turn to page two, you will see that it immediately does two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| The first thing that it does is it publishes to the Knox County commission website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| And at the same time, it would push out an e-mail to Jolie's e-mail list of those people who receive these notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| by e-mail routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| If you go to the third page, that is what you would see if you would click on the short narrative that you saw on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=374)|
| 0:06:23| It would be the full description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| So from a disclosure standpoint, it would be available to anybody on the intranet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| but would be published through the secure login of the intranet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| And it goes out to any e-mail address that she's built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Anything that Jolie would want it to go to, including Mike Danila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=400)|
| 0:06:50| Or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Does anybody have any questions or anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| I'm not on committee, but I have a question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| I'm not sure that I understood John right, and I want to be sure it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=418)|
| 0:07:05| Intranet and internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| If I put something up here about a meeting on intranet, it's just out there on the intranet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| It does not go automatically to the list serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| It will go to the list serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| It will go to the list that Jolie has put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| Just like she sent it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| It will go to the internet, like on page two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| And so you've done it through the secure intranet, but it sends it to the intranet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| But that was my concern that it went to the list serve also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| And you'll be able to go to the website and look and see if it published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| Because people, you know, they might not look on the internet when they're used to getting an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| They'll get an e-mail also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| E-mail also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=471)|
| 0:07:51| John, can Jolie create a paper copy for file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| There's no reason you wouldn't be able to print a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| And if we could get a definition from you on what's required in the way of retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| we may be able to also retain it on the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| So the wording publicly noticed through the commission office or through appropriate intranet process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| What about posting it on the commission forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| Would that count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| I don't think it would count because it wouldn't shoot out an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| It wouldn't shoot the e-mail out to the media and to the desired people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Is there any way, John, to link it up so that if we post it to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| it automatically gets posted to the forum as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| I'd have to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| The forum is maintained on a separate server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| and is a completely distinct separate piece of software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Well, I was pretty much just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| I just wanted to teach you a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| I'll put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| So the most you got any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| One of the things that I specifically asked about last time that I don't see on here is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| And this is one of the places where I think that the state code actually gets it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| We complain a lot that the state code is not clear or it's ambiguous or it doesn't go far enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| or it makes us do things but doesn't give us the money to do them, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| But this is where it actually makes sense, where it says the state says adequate public notice in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| is determined by a totality of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| And that's something that I specifically requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| We look at last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| I don't see anything about that in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| And it's something that I think that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| I feel like there are occasionally times that we're going to need to have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| either of the entire commission or of a committee, such as the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| where 48 hours may simply not be available to us for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| One example would be if it's Friday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| We have a full commission meeting on Monday with a heavy agenda of some pretty important stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| And they're calling for, you know, eight inches of snow on Sunday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| So we can either send out a notice that we're going to meet Sunday afternoon at three o'clock to do our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| or we can wait until all the snow falls and then melts and meet a week or two after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| So there are always circumstances like that that pop up from time to time that I think we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| allowances for in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| And another example that I want to give you, in fact, I'll ask Jolie to pull this up for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| so that you wouldn't have to simply take my word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| I can pass it around for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| From our own commission rules, which is what this will get added to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| it says that the commission chairman and one other member of the commission shall attend the annual meeting of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=664)|
| 0:11:12| National Association of Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| And that's supposed to happen every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| This past year, the national meeting was in Portland in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| Our commissioner or commission chair was not able to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| But, you know what, if he wants to run for office in the future, two days before Election Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| someone could send out a mailer with a black-and-white grainy photo of him with his shoulders hunched up in a gavel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| and across the top it could say, Mike Hammond broke commission rules as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| It wouldn't be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| It wouldn't be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| But it would be true according to our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| So those are the kind of unintended consequences that we can get into when we don't make allowances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| for the totality of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| So I feel very, very strongly that if we're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| we need to make sure that there is an exception that includes the totality of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=727)|
| 0:12:17| In fact, Joe, is this something that you could comment on for us that as far as what the Tennessee Code says about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=737)|
| 0:12:29| and how we might make that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| Which aspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Are you talking about the notion of going to NACO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| No, not about NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Actually, that's something that I'd like to see the Rules Committee address is go through our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| and deal with stuff like this that doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| You may just want to change that to permissive may and not shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| because what happens if you don't have the budget for that or there's a state of emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| That is one thing you may want to consider changing, just using the permissive may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| But in terms of this 48-hour rule and, like you said, state of emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| is that something that you could give us some guidance on as to how we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| with this particular rule that we're considering adding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| Well, any time you, you know, again, as I mentioned in my memo to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| the law reads that you do look at the totality of the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| You look at the reasonableness of the notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| and there is at least one court that question anything below 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| which, you know, subjects you to at least, you know, a potential action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| But if you're going to make allowances for states of emergency, usually in cases like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=816)|
| 0:13:44| it's better to be as specific as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| So, for instance, if an issue occurs that is of great public importance that merits a deviation 48-hour rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| you should allow yourself that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Now, it's a given if it's in a state of emergency as determined by local law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| the mayor or the governor, that automatically nullifies, you know, and will overrule your local rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| But in terms of if you're going to go below that 48-hour rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| it shouldn't merely be for the convenience of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| It should be because of an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Or, again, let's say, for instance, a commissioner is ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| You're voting on an issue on a Monday of great public importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Less than 48 hours may be appropriate in that instance to ensure that commissioner is fully apprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| and lucid enough to vote intelligently during that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| So what would we need to add to this to include that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| Well, you could add that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| minimum 48-hour notice is to be given unless there is a, you know, we are in a state of emergency or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| There are extenuating circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Yes, that lead, that require you to deviate from that rule because of a matter of great public importance, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| Is that acceptable to you, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| I think it's somebody's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| I mean, I think there's items that we all want to vote on, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| But what it'll be, that opens it back up to opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| But putting it in there, I mean, you've got to answer for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| You know, I mean, whoever changes it has to answer for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| If nobody objects to adding, what is the exact words, Joe, that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Well, I would say that, you know, except in a state of emergency or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| a matter of great public importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| But, again, that should be used very judiciously because if you create a rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| and then you just merely do it as a matter of convenience, you're going to open yourselves up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| you know, possible attack either legally or just in the court of public opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| And I think we're all aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| And I think that we all are capable of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=953)|
| 0:16:03| Well, like I said, and Ed pointed this out at the last meeting, that since I had been in the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| and all this started with a 44-hour notice rather than a 48-hour notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| that got somebody's knickers in a lot about it on their blog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| And the audit committee had had its most important meeting of the year, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=979)|
| 0:16:29| And I also had to miss the work session because I had just had major surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| And Ed felt it was absolutely critical to bring me up to date before we voted on it at Monday's commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=994)|
| 0:16:42| And because of extenuating circumstances, we wound up with a 44-hour notice instead of a 48-hour notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1002)|
| 0:16:51| Now, anybody who thinks that we were abusing that notice for our convenience would lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1011)|
| 0:16:59| But that's the sort of thing that we need to be taking into consideration if we're going to make a rule like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| You done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| With that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| So here's the wording of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| At least 48 hours prior to the C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| At least 48 hours except in a state of emergency or a matter of public importance to such meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1035)|
| 0:17:24| Joe, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| That's exactly what it said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| I mean, if that's what you're comfortable with, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| So, and excepting in a state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Except in a state of emergency or a matter of public importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| A matter of great public importance, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| Yeah, that works for me because that covers if somebody is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| The next question I have is about can you explain to me, Joe, again about the idea of a quorum that when we do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1069)|
| 0:18:03| to notice a meeting specifically when there's a quorum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| I mean, does it matter if there's a quorum, if there's not a quorum as to what kind of notice we have to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| or what kind of agenda or minutes we have to keep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| The way the Tennessee Open Records Act, Open Meetings Act operates is if two or more are gathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| then you're deliberating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Now, obviously under your rules, a simple majority or a quorum to actually conduct business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| and deliberate and make a decision is different than the requirements under the Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| But if you're going to meet and discuss business, regardless, even if you're going to just discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| you fall under the Open Meetings Act and as such these rules apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| And another question I had about minutes and agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1126)|
| 0:18:57| Does that have to do either with whether or not there's a quorum or a vote taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Minutes at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Minutes can be anything from jotting notes down on a legal pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| It's just that if a citizen comes later and says, I was at Panera's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| I saw two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| What did they talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| There should be at least some record of that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| It doesn't have to be a verbatim transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| It doesn't have to be videotaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| It has to be at least something where a person of average intelligence can look at those notes and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| okay, I know what they discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Well, that brings me to my next question is that when there are three commissioners at a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| who keeps the minutes and where are they kept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| One of the commissioners can decide who to keep them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| and that commissioner can keep them in their possession or ultimately turn them over to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| Whoever takes them becomes the custodian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| But I would file them with the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Well, that's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Mark Harmon had a really good system where when he had a meeting, he would actually post the minutes on the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| You know, actually, I wouldn't mind adding something onto the agenda or onto this where whoever keeps notes posts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1195)|
| 0:20:05| them to the commission forum because that way we don't have to worry about them getting lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| We don't have to ask Jolie to keep track of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| They're right there for anybody who wants to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| They must be kept and made available for inspection by members of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| So either on the forum or in the commission office, either one is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| It's easier on the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| No, I mean, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| I think it's really if you're having a meeting and you've got your laptop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| and you can open it up to the forum and you can, you know, do it as you meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| or it takes five minutes to put it on there, you know, when you get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| But that way it's not something we have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I've got meetings from all kinds of minutes from all kinds of meetings on, like Joe was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| legal pads and notebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| And I hate to just toss them in Jolie's lap and say, here you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Well, if there wasn't another commissioner there, you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| Well, I've never seen another commissioner taking notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| I'm just saying, if there's not a commissioner at your meeting, if you go to North Knox neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Which brings me to my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| Before you get off of that one, can I just make one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Talk about now I would not be in favor of you must put them on the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| I mean, you might if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| But if you look at the forum usage, you don't get a lot of usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| And some of us are not forum friendly and don't want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| I think leaving that up to the preference of the commissioner would be the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| My next thing is the difference between a chance meeting and a regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| because I know that chance meetings we don't have to worry about sun shining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| And that's if, well, like Tony and I for some reason wound up at the same party on election night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| And it was great to see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| That's a chance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| It's a chance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| But it quickly could morph into a public meeting if you discuss business upon which you may ultimately deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| Right, which we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| We discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| No, but I'm just saying that's how people presume, well, this is a chance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| But there's still restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| So I understand about chance meetings like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| My concern is with regular chance meetings, such as the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1356)|
| 0:22:47| When I went back through, I researched the public notices starting when I became on the commission in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1367)|
| 0:22:56| And I really delved deep into 2011, and I'm working my way through 2010 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| I know how many public meetings each one of us have noticed, how many of them were less than 48 hours, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| who they were with, what they were for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| You know, I've got all that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| And, you know, sometimes the Council of West Knox County Homeowners gets noticed and sometimes it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| And I know that there's usually more than two commissioners there discussing items that come before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| I think that those kinds of meetings ought to be publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| Same thing with, you know, the Powell Republican Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| I know that there's usually more than one commissioner who goes to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| Those aren't just regular community meetings or chance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| Same thing as if Sam and I both went to a Board of Governors meeting of the Knox County Democratic Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| And you know that at those meetings we're going to be discussing items coming up on the commission agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| or on the city council agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Those things, of course, Sam and I have not shown up at the same meeting at the Democratic Party in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| But those things, I think, I would feel ethically that I would need to notice a meeting like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| And I think that the same thing needs to happen with the local Republican clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| any of the local community groups that meet on a regular basis to discuss items that come before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| If there's more than one commissioner there, I would hope that those would also be sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| I know just from discussions that we've had that, you know, there have been commissioners that, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| and I keep saying the Council of West Knox County Homeowners because that's the one that keeps popping into my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| When they were talking about, you know, slope ridgeside or slope ridge and hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| that was a hot issue at a meeting, and there were a lot of commissioners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Those sorts of things, I think, need to be publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| And the fact that they've been sort of noticed in the past but not always, I think we need to have some consistency with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1509)|
| 0:25:25| So I think as a group we should discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Guys, I make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Do we want to publicly, ethically, should we publicly notice meetings that are not chance meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1528)|
| 0:25:36| that we know there are going to be issues discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| We know there's going to be more than one commissioner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Ethically, should we notice those meetings or should we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Mr. Romney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| I understand what Commissioner Burles was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| I go to the West Knox Republican Club meeting every single month, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| I'm a member of that, and I was a member before I became a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| I don't know which commissioner is going to show up, if any, that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| And then I'm going to have to sit here and take notes, even though I'm not going to discuss with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| I'm only going over the agenda that month of what's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| If citizens want to talk to me afterwards, they can talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| I don't discuss anything with any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| I think this is a slippery slope we're going to be going down, that we're going to be publicly noticing when we go to the grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| when we go to the Y to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| If I know R. Larry Smith is a member of the Y, he may be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| So I've got to ‑‑I just think this is a slippery slope we don't need to be going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| I mean, I'm ethically, and I don't discuss anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| And you can ask anybody that's been to any meeting I went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| I do not discuss anything with anybody commissioners I run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| And, plus, if you publicly notice this, these are Republican Club meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| That means they're open to Republicans, not all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| So then you're going to get to where Red Lobster is going to have to shut down the whole restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| in order to have everybody in there, if we publicly notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| The meeting I'm going to use as an example is Town Hall East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Sam McKenzie and I may be at Town Hall East this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| but probably won't since I've been told the Republican Club is going to meet this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| So I'm going to go to a place with a better meal than Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| I'm going to go to Red Lobster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| I say that tongue in cheek, but I believe the words that I've heard used are disgust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1657)|
| 0:27:45| I don't know what's going to be disgust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| I don't know what the president of the West Knox Republican Club may stand up and say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| I do know this, though, that I will not deliberate with anyone there about what I'm going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| as far as votes coming before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| I'm not going to say this is how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Or let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| That's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Deliberation is casting a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| How will I vote on an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| I don't have all the information yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| So the biggest sentence in the open meetings, we're going to call it court finding here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1697)|
| 0:28:28| was that school board knows, city council knows the difference between discussion and deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1708)|
| 0:28:38| It's county commission that didn't know the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| And I think there's that description, those definitions is what we have to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| Discussion versus deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| I would offer to you that whenever we as individual commissioners happen to run into each other at the IGA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1733)|
| 0:29:02| Town Hall East, or the Republican West Knox or whatever club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1742)|
| 0:29:10| It is by chance most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| It is by chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| And the get-together is not predicated upon Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| and I getting together at the Halls Republican Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| The meeting is predicated upon those citizens in North Knox County of like minds wanting to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| and talk about a scholarship fund or who's running for dog catcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1776)|
| 0:29:46| So that it is not like, and it's the reason I've steered away from it in most instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1786)|
| 0:29:57| the noticing of public meetings on behalf of two commissioners getting together is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| Well, therein we've drawn the bright line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| Is that a good word there, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| I'm looking for at least a C-plus on this course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| I grew up on the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| We're trying, what we're really discussing and maybe in this instance working toward a deliberative stance is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1818)|
| 0:30:29| we're drawing a line between chance meetings, which are Republican clubs in Town Hall East and the Ruatan Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1829)|
| 0:30:37| and a call-specific meeting amongst commissioners talking about the work of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1837)|
| 0:30:46| There's two distinct settings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| And in the noticing of commissioners will be present, we're saying that we're going to have an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| I believe that's what the law director just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| We're going to have an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| That means items that will be talked about so that if items that concern me are not on that agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| then I don't have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| But if there's something there to be discussed that I may have a need for information of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| then I'll be there because there is an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| And then where we keep public record of that meeting, whether it be on the commission web forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| or whether you take them on legal paper and file them away for your grandkids to burn, that's immaterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1884)|
| 0:31:32| I believe the point that we're discussing right at the moment is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| if two commissioners get together to discuss a topic, then you need to have an agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| and you need to keep notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| I agree with what Mr. Wright said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| I just want to say this to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| You can nitpick this thing today and add what ifs until the cows come home, but don't overburden it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| Legally, a discussion is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| A deliberation is a deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| We can discuss 24 hours a day if we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| We just cannot deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| So don't tie it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Maybe it was good that we did a 44-hour so we can focus on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| It was an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| I was out of town and didn't have computer access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| It fell to under 48 when Amy and I finally spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| But I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Today is a good example of what everything is going on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| I regularly go to West Council, West Knox homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| There's Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Tony is often there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Jeff spoke last month about his role on the redistricting committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| But tonight I want to go to West Knox Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| I also want to go to Town Hall East, but I'm probably going to go to Fountain City Town Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| because they're talking about the crematorium and the problems out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Old North is having a potluck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Well, I want to go to Old North, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| I did see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| But to hypothetically, to notice everything that we could, more than one of us could hypothetically go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| is just a pretty big challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| And then you've got to write the minutes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| I don't want to sit there and have to write minutes at Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| But, anyway, I run all over town, as many of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| But I run for that obligation, and I do it as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| So I lean more towards that sort of a chance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| I don't wear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| It's in Larry's district, I guess, so he might be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| But I'm not going to go and ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| He's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| So we send out a public notice on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| I just think that's too much a burden for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| And then for I think it falls under the chance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| And I'm not going to go in a corner and talk to somebody about how I'm going to vote on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| I assure you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Mr. Ambrose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Yeah, I'm glad to hear you all say that because, as I've dug into this research over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| I've seen, like I said, some noticing of the West Knox Council of County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| I've seen some noticing of ribbon cuttings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| I've seen some noticing of ground breakings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| I've seen noticing of some, like, birthday parties and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2048)|
| 0:34:18| So I want us all to be in agreement on what needs to be noticed and what doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| Now, I see a big difference between, for me, a chance meeting is running into somebody at the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| Going to the same community meeting with the same people month after month after month, ethically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2070)|
| 0:34:39| in my opinion, that's not a chance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Whether or not that needs to be noticed, you know, is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| I think we all know the difference between discussion and deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| And based on that, we don't need to be noticing any of this because we're not deliberating at any of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| Even when we get together for lunch or for breakfast or for whatever, we're not deliberating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| We're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| So, you know, to use that in one situation but not in the other, others, I don't think is quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| I'm struggling here, guys, with our lack of consistency that we seem to have with these types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2113)|
| 0:35:22| Commissioner Burroughs, I'm going to have to ask you to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| I also want to know who is going to be responsible for things like pension board, the justice task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2125)|
| 0:35:33| Those are all done through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Those are all done through Joe Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Well, but in the past some have not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| So I think that needs to be specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| If we're going to make a rule, we need to make it a good rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| and we need to make sure that all of our bases are covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| We're lacking in consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| Mr. Smith, last comment and then we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| I just want a little clarification, and I guess, too, for the viewing public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| Joe, you've seen me at, say, we'll go back to the halls of public committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| I always give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| I'm sort of like Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| I just give a synopsis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Here's what's coming on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| And a lot of times what I'll do, I'll ask, and I know Dave's seen me do this, you know, what is your opinion on this or that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| And I don't throw an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| I just want to, because I represent citizens, I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| And if Dave's there, which, you know, usually we show up to the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| But, Joe, if we've not sunshined it and the fact that the press is there, can we go ahead and start talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2185)|
| 0:36:35| Because the press is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| And they're listening to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Well, you know, any of the meetings I've been to, you know, I've never seen what I would consider people deliberating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| towards a vote on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| And that's one thing you clearly want to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I mean, again, the mere fact that the media is there doesn't necessarily mean that the public is put on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| You know, what you want to avoid is you should always err in favor of taking the most conservative approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| If you have a contentious issue that's coming up on the county commission agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| and you feel that this most likely would be bantered about in a future meeting, non-commissioned meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| and there will be more than one commissioner present, err in favor of noticing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| I mean, just about every meeting I go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| there's always press at everyone, at all the professional businesses and the republic committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| There's always press at all those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| So I just want clarifications for the people at home, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| For the committee members, the thing we have before us is what you have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| And it says, with the amendments, the commission office or through appropriate intranet process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| And after 48 hours, it says, except in a state emergency or a matter of great public importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| Any questions about what the committee is about to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| One more thing, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| I just wanted to say thank you for the hard work that you put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| I think you did a really good job and you've run a great meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| And I know I've talked a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| I appreciate you bearing with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| It carries over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| We'll consider this on the next commission agenda and try to add it next week after the final wording is taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| That brings the Rules Committee to a close for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114rules?start=2294)|
