| 0:06:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=366)|

| 0:06:13| First name, Igor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Last name, Chabon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Mr. Chabon, could you give us the 30-second version of what you're getting ready to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| So the whole plan is for me to build a, let's say, warehouse shop with an office for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| HVAC business that I own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| I mean, I've spoke with Mr. Gerald about it many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| We have meetings with Liz as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| I mean, there wasn't any discussions on them declining to proceed forward with the CB request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=396)|
| 0:06:44| that I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| I'm going to get a motion to approve the sector plan for MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| We have a proper motion by Commissioner Anderson and a second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Seeing none, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Congratulations, but don't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| So, all right, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Next item is 10-C-19-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| It's also a request of Igor Chabon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| It's for rezoning from A, agricultural, to C, B, and business and manufacturing, to C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| B, business and manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| And the property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| By a vote of 11-0, the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission recommended approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| a planned commercial for a 3.2-acre portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| The Planning Commission looked at the topography of the area and felt that a planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| would be better than the GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| However, Mr. Chabon does request a general commercial zoning for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| I see the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Any comments on this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Well, I mean, when I purchased the land and after a meeting with the engineer a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| times, he advised me that the best thing to do for further expansion, if I wanted to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| or anything, is to try and see if we can change or add a little bit more commercial because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| there is 6.7 acres total on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| And that's what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| And I reached out to Liz, I reached out to Michelle, and to Mr. Green here, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| had many discussions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| And at first, when I first submitted the application, I submitted to turn the whole property into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| But then I was advised by Mr. Green himself to reduce the amount of requests that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| asked to a smaller portion, and that's exactly what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| And I wasn't present here during the NPC meeting that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| I had to leave the country on an emergency, family emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| And when I came back, I found out that they granted PC approval, and it's not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| that I've requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| And since there's already an acre and a half of commercial there, and I've had a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| with Mr. Anders as well about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| I just don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| I mean, I personally don't see it as a negative or something horrible to just expand to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| add an additional acre and a half, or however much I've asked, to a total of 3.5 acres commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| So glad to open that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| So what you're saying is you weren't at the Planning Commission meeting when you had originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| asked for the, yeah, for CB, but it was approved for planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| And you're not happy with that is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Well, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Or prefer the other zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| This is something you can live with, but you prefer the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I'm trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| I prefer, to be clear, I prefer them in commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| I mean, having PC, that would put me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| I mean, I've been already backed up with the plans and everything about two months, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| that would put me back even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| And I've spoke with Mr. Green about it, and I've spoke with Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| I've talked to him and emailed him a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| It's just not a, you know, if I would have requested for the whole property to be commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| that would be something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| But, I mean, I'm just requesting for an additional that's already there in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| It's not much to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| I'm going to, you mentioned Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I'm going to go ahead and call Mr. Anders here to provide additional insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Gerald and I spoke about this, and I think there was some miscommunication along the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| But the property is bigger than just the one point added acreage, correct, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| The entire property is over six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| And the request is, looking at the map, I mean, you go behind them, it's residential on the other side of the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| and they're not touching any of the ridge that, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| They're actually doing what we choose for people to do, have a buffer with green space on the slopes and ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| Is there an objection from the staff as to making that smaller portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| I mean, I know you don't like the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| And the cut-up portion is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| And, you know, staff's recommendation is just that, a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| And as Mr. Chabon said, he was not present at the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| The planning commission did not have the statements that he made this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| Well, I think he.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Is the desire for you, Mr. Chabon, to leave the rest of the property as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| Well, I mean, my whole point of expanding is, you know, I have already had the plans in place for the shop, for the warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=682)|
| 0:11:30| everything that's in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| But just, you know, I hate for me to start to build the shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| and then later on, if I needed to expand just a little bit, you know, not being able to do it because it's agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| And I know for a fact, I mean, I've seen cases and I've worked with people that had the same issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| and they were denied and denied and denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| And, I mean, I went the way, the right way to do things is to ask before I do anything, and that's what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| I listened to the engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| That's what he advised me, and that's what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| So, I mean, if you look at surroundings properties, they're commercial, left, right, across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| and the property has already got CB on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| Part of the property is already CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Am I reading it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| I'll make a motion that we grant CB on the portion that the applicant has requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| I have a motion from Commissioner Anders to amend this from PC to CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| and I have a second from Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| I'll go to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Mr. Green, at the MPC meeting, did the applicant have representation there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| or did you guys just go forward with the file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| He had representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Did they express that interest at the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Not at that meeting, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| So the MPC commissioners had no idea this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| They knew because staff advised that the application was for CB as opposed to PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=777)|
| 0:13:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Was CB presented to the planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| Did the planning commission consider CB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| The staff's recommendation was PC because of the topography of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| The application stated that the applicant requested CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| and that was stated verbally to the planning commission during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| I think there was some negotiation of the size of the parcel to be rezoned, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Prior to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| At first, it was all the way up the hill, CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| and he went down to what his possible expansion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| I think that was the issue that was not expressed clearly at the staff meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| I ask because there is a line of cases that requires the zoning designation to be submitted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| and considered by the planning commission prior to approval by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| The application in this case says CA, and the recommendation was PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=847)|
| 0:14:20| Now we're talking about CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| There is a possibility that that could be a stumbling block for this applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=862)|
| 0:14:30| if the county commission approves this and it wasn't considered by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| I don't express any opinion about whether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| The staff recommendation on the note says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| plans commercial zoning as demonstrated in Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Applicant requested CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| That's what the notes say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| That's what the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| I would think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| I've got no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| The application I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| zoning change CB, proposed zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| And I think they just, in the sector plan previous, I mean, they said commercial GC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| so I think it's pretty clear what the request was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| If I may come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=925)|

| 0:15:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=934)|

| 0:15:39| Can I ask you a question while he's walking back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Mr. Green, while you're walking back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| was there a reason that the reduction in the fee that was charged in Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| which is the one that you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| was a reason the staff recommended some additional costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| So, I mean, I think it was a reason for the reduction in the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| I'm sorry, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=958)|

| 0:16:02| And while you're walking back, was there a reason that the reduction in the fee that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| was charged is because it was originally based on the whole parcel and this is just doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| a part of the parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=971)|

| 0:20:28| The current zoning that's approved will support 22, and I know while that doesn't seem like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| it's three when you're talking about 25 to 22, that's also is a big deal in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| And I will submit that the rationale to say that it's just the built environment is 2.33| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| per acre is a little flawed in today's world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| The reason being is because we have lots back in those days, and I did a lot of those subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| around there, that were 90, 100 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| And now because of the cost of development, we're really having to strangle those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| down to where they're 50 and 60 feet wide so that you're able to get more units on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| piece of property out of necessity just because of the development cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| So we would appreciate taking this up to the 4.5 dwelling units per acre, which allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| us 25 buildings, 25 townhomes and single family buildings, units on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| And I think now it's approved at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| So that's my synopsis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| The Chair will consider a motion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| I want to make a motion that we approve the zoning up to five units per acre per the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| I mean, per my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| So Commissioner Bussler's motion is to approve for five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| The motion dies for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Commissioner Bussler, would you like to amend your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1331)|
| 0:22:22| You know, it's been told that we try to get the most we can out of this by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| You know, what we're going forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| I made my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| I don't have a second on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Mr. Green, is this, how does this, or Mr. Campbell, how does this property lay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| It lays pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| You know, obviously we're intended, but we're not having a lot of grading or else we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| be able to get these units as close together on five acres of property as we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| I'm trying to see, Commissioner Daly, if I do have a contour map that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| But it fronts on Bishop Road, just down from Tate Trotter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| Hold on just a minute, I apologize for not having that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| It does lay very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| There is a small stream at the back corner of the property, which would be, force the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| development towards the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| And we've comprehended that in our layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Again, I apologize for not finding that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| Well, the vote was 7-4 at KK, CP, PC, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| I'll make a motion that we do the request of four dwelling units per acre as per Knoxville-Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1419)|
| 0:23:48| County planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| We have a motion on the floor from Commissioner Daly for four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| We have a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| We'll move to continuing the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Mr. Green, oh, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| Mr. Green, I'm looking at the staff recommendation, and their recommendation to you was three dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| units per acre based on the surrounding density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| And so, based on that recommendation, then the MPC planning commissioners bumped it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| to the four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| And was the argument that Mr. Campbell had stated here tonight, was that also brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| up before the MPC commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| That was brought up, and that resulted in the density above the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| But the staff originally just thought three would be ideal for this because of the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| in the back of the property, we'd have to move everything to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| So you'd have a cluster of homes towards the front of the property then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| So I did consider the character of the surrounding area and felt like a jump from 2.33 to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| units an acre would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| So then, could you surmise that on the existing land that's buildable, that it's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| going to be closer to six units an acre because they're going to be grouped closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1508)|
| 0:25:17| I don't have enough information to answer that question because I haven't seen the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| I'll make a substitute motion that we zone at 4.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| We have a substitute motion on the floor from Commissioner Smith for 4.5 units an acre and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| the second, I believe that was Commissioner Anders, okay, and a second from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| So the motion on the floor is 4.5 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| Commissioner Biggs, your light was on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| We'll do the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| And Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Sir, can you help describe what this would look like if you have the other, I'm looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| at a map with the other neighborhoods around it are at 2.76, 2.57, 1.66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| These are, from just an aerial view, looks to be like normal subdivision plots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| And 20 years ago, you would be exactly right because 20 years ago, I developed, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| developed, I did the engineering on several of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| Mendenhall is one that backs up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| And we were making, because of the development cost and you look at what the cost per lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| is and all that, you were able to make the lots a lot larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| You were able to make those lots, like I stated before, 90, 100 feet wide and still get your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| development cost out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| So people wanted to make lots a little bit bigger because it let them get side entry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| garages and a lot of different things that they thought were selling points at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| The reality on this piece of property is that, the reality of today is that's just not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| world we live in because, again, we've gone from roughly $200 a running foot for the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1627)|
| 0:27:15| of a development to somewhere almost at $800 a running foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| And part of the reason I will submit that we've done that is that we've let properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| that should be developed at four and five units an acre get developed at, and some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| this is the developer's fault too, get developed at two and three units per acre, where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| could have been developed at higher, so now your land cost has to go up extraordinarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| on pieces that can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Also during this time, remember Emory Road was a two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| Emory Road was not a five-lane road with sidewalks and certainly there was not a traffic signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| to be comprehended at Bishop and Emory Road, which is going to improve that situation dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| So, yes, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| At the time these were developed, those subdivision lots were, quote, normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| What we're seeing today, the subdivision lots that we propose are normal, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| So will the characteristic of your build be similar but on smaller lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| Yeah, we've got townhomes and single families where all these are all single families, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| I think it's either the parcel below us or one has got a lot of condominiums too that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| are pretty tightly packed together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| So this area is mixed with condominium-type units as well as single-family units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| And I think we're probably a quarter-mile, does that sound about right from Emory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| So it's not like we're in some rural place where condominiums and townhomes are out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| They certainly are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| I mean, we, our office is almost across the street from this location and it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| What's the timeline of your project and what's the timeline of that signal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| That signal, I'm going to have to defer to Jim, but our project probably is looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| a year, well, probably two to three years before we have a build out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| Thanks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Yeah, we're in right-of-way negotiations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| The project is fully funded, so as soon as right-of-way acquisitions occur and the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| is complete, we actually can bid the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| So it's ready to go to bid, just a matter of acquiring the necessary properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| So I would think it would be let sometime next summer and, give or take, maybe a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| So it'll be in before this development is fully finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| I would think that would be reasonable, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| We're going back to some folks who have spoken before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| I've got Daley, Smith & Busler in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Mr. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| At 4.5 units per acre, will you have to come before BZA to ask for any type of variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1788)|
| 0:29:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| I mean, we've got, again, we've got a town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| I've got the layout here that we have, and I don't know if we present this to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| usually the way this process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| No, all of our setbacks are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| All of our grading drainage seems to be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| So I don't think we're going to, we're not going to ask for a, any kind of setback variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| No, that's 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| As long as the, I can go with the 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| That's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| I just don't want you to have to, I don't want to see on our agenda at BZA that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| coming asking for a variance when we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Yeah, we don't want to create substandard lots, and we understand that because we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| understand we don't want to come in front of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| We've tried to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Director Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| I noticed here recently we've been going to developed out units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| When was this changed in philosophy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| We're continuing to move to increased density from a jump from the, and we hear the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| side too from the neighbors that they want development to be compatible with the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| of their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| And they don't care if it was 20, the neighborhood was 20 years, developed 20 years ago, 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| ago, or five months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| They want the same character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| When we jump from 2.33 units an acre to 4 units an acre, that's a, we'll hear from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| neighbors that we're allowing development out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| We have to take a lot of issues into consideration and try to present you with a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| that serves the community well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| So is that a policy change or is it an ordinance change or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| It's the same policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| We're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| We're making greater transitions from the built character now than we were two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Two years ago it was pretty much, if the built character is 2.33, we'd recommend 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| We're moving up in each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| We ratcheted up a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Back to Commissioner Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Mr. Robitaille was out there on that piece of property and you're not going to move much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| dirt at all on that particular piece of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| No, our goal is, again, it lays pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| We do have a creek in the corner, but that's where the detention area is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| And we do get to count those areas, detention and other things, in our units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| So we are going to be at the 4.5 because, frankly, that's the best that we can responsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| develop this property at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| But 5 is what you asked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| No, we may have asked for 5, but we knew we were going to be in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Again, part of the problem is we don't fully develop all these plans before we come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| So 4.5 is good with you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| 4.5 works perfectly for us, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| People, I want to tell you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| This is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| I walked the property and you're not going to move much dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| I saw what was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| I didn't appreciate not getting a second on the 5 because Mr. Roberts here is a good engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| and a good developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| So I'm going to go with the 4.5, but I take that as an offense from you all not getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| a second on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2003)|

| 0:33:36| Madam Clerk, before we move on, I noticed some scouts have just entered the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| I'm guessing they're working on their citizenship and a community merit badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2025)|

| 0:34:44| Mr. Green, if you could give us an overview on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2084)|

| 0:35:04| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2107)|

| 0:35:09| Applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| I'm John Valiant, 800 South Gay Street in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| I represent Ball Homes, and Ball Homes representatives are also here to answer any questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| What I'd like to do tonight, for those of you, when we have these types of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| usually I like to give each side an opportunity just to talk about their plans and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| So, what I'm going to start things off with, I'm going to go and I did have two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| express an interest, I mean, Alan and, let me go back and check my records here, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| we had Alan Hill and Marshall Smith both requested to speak at public forum on this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| What I usually do is extend 10 minutes to talk about a particular issue, so I'm happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| to extend you all 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Each of you can speak for five, and then I'm going to allow the applicant to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| to that for another 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| And don't feel like you've got to take the whole 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| These things sometimes take a little bit less time, but I'll go ahead and call on Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Alan, if you could please approach the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| I'm Alan Hill, 2500 Echo Brook Lane, Knoxville, 37932, in the Covered Bridge Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| I've lived there for four and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Go ahead, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| So, Chairman Nystrom and Chairwoman, Vice Chairwoman Carringer and County Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| thank you for your time to hear us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| We probably won't be under 10 minutes, so we do have several people here, not only from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Covered Bridge, and I'll actually ask everyone here that's interested in this issue and opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| to please stand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| We have folks from Covered Bridge, Hunter's Way, Creekside Manor, West Gallaher Ferry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Road area, and other areas, as I see in the back, haven't had a chance to talk to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| So quite a few are very interested in this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Besides myself and Marshall, we do have Joe Bouvar from Hunter's Way who asked to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| briefly too, but I'll try to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| First of all, I want to say hats off to the TPO team and the Planning Commission for doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| that Hardin Valley Mobility Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| I went down there twice, and it was one of the most engaging community efforts I ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| The turnout was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| I know Commissioner Schoonmaker was there and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| It was really good turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| So hats off to them for what they've done, and also for Kim Frazier for being a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| for those in Hardin Valley that haven't really had a collective voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| And then secondly, thanks to Jim Snowden and his team with the Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| Jim, I've been bugging the last several days, asking a lot of questions and details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| He's always been prompt and very thorough, so Jim, thank you to you and your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| And then Drew Seals was the fastest response to any county office I've ever had on email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| I emailed Drew last week and said, how do I get a presentation up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| And it was like less than a minute, I had a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| So Drew, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| And she's going to be my clicker tonight since I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| So let me, I want to show a couple slides to show you the area we're focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| So go ahead, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| So, and it's hard to see, and I'm sure Mr. Talent, Valiant, has several things in mind, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| And they've been very good to meet with us before, I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| But this area around Hardin Valley, this is better pictorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| You see the area right in the center, actually when this was on Google Maps, the area right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| in the center on the right-hand side, that's actually Hunter's Way subdivision, where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| intersection of Hardin Valley with the sharp curve and the beautiful historic barn is at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| Hickory Creek there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| And so our subdivision is to the left there, Covered Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| You see the one on the bottom left, yeah, I wish they had the laser pointer, too, that'd be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Thanks, Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2343)|
| 0:39:11| The area here on the left where Marshall's going to be speaking about in a second, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| Creekside Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| And so the area that Ryan and Mr. Valiant will be talking about is this area here, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| old Seal Family property, about 117 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| And then most notably, one of the things I want to talk about, a stormwater runoff in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| moment, but as you turn through here, Connor Creek comes down through here, down this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| and goes under our nice bridge at Covered Bridge there on Rustic Trail Way, and it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| on into Melton Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| So that frames the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Before we go to the next slide, I just want to say that to these gentlemen here with Wal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Holmes and the commission, we're not opposed to new development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| I mean, I wouldn't be able to live there unless Covered Bridge was developed around 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| But what we'd like to see is well-planned developments along with coordinated infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| improvements in cooperation with and oversight from Knox County Planning Commission, County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| Commission, Knox County Engineering and Public Works, Transportation Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| TDEC, and TDOT, not only before development, but after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| We're talking about compliance to what's set forth in that way, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| So surely tonight, as you commissioners evaluate this new development, you'd have to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| the current subdivisions that are in the contiguous area around this 117-acre parcel, its potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| impact and the stress on current infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| As you evaluate any new development, the goal should be to minimize congestion and impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| on existing communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| We're concerned that this potential ballhome development will not only exacerbate the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| problems we have, but will potentially more significantly adversely impact current Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| residents' properties, properties' values, safety, and quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| Let me ask you guys a question quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| How many have been from Pellissippi Parkway on Hardin Valley Road, Hickory Creek, all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| Buttermilk and Everett Road there at Watt Road within the past 24 months personally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| Keep your hands raised if you've been there the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| Keep your hands raised if you've been there the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| So if you haven't been there maybe the last two months, and you can put your hands down, thank you very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| that's why I put these slides up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| If you haven't been there in the last two months, honestly, as fast as things are going, it changes on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| daily basis as any of my friends can attest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| So the first thing I want to talk about real quick is density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| If you look around the area around this, and again, other slides don't have this slide here from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Gerald Green's packet there, but in Covered Bridge we have a density of 1.8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2495)|
| 0:41:44| Massey Creek, up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Creekside Manor, 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| And the new Brody Glen, I think it's called, that Hunter Harrison is doing, which is back here off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| Marietta Church, and it will, I think, adjoin the sealed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| There's another development here, and it's zoned for 2.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| So if you look at the average there, the applicant asked for 3.5 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| It was a motion made by Mr. Clancy in the Planning Commission meeting back in October for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| It was denied, went to 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| That was denied, and it finally was settled on 2.23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| However, the Planning Commission staff, with all their expertise, recommended 1.88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| So it's still higher, and we in our group, we've been talking, and we think 2.23 is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| Maybe a little bit more, but we're concerned about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| And so that impacts stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| So, Drew, if you'll click the next couple slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| This shows you, I call this the curve at Hardin Valley, coming around Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| And just to my right there is where Hickory Creek intersects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| I think the battery ran down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Submitter button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Yep, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| So, to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Go ahead to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| So there's where it turns into Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| Beautiful barn, historic structure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| You see the for sale sign is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| And then go ahead, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| So there again, the historic barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| It's probably 80 years old, probably in the 30s or 40s that was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Beautiful structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Go ahead, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| So here's the dry, what I call the ditch going down the East Gallaher Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| That's where East Gallaher Ferry goes down to our subdivision on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| So next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| So this was in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| This was not, I'll show you some pictures of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| but this is just this summer in July, a heavy rainstorm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| And this is not unusual, and many of my neighbors can attest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| that any heavy storm, even outside the 100-year flood that we had in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| this is the kind of conditions we get now that goes on down our creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| And a lot of this, we feel, has come from the extra runoff at Creekside Manor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| going down the parallel road to Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| So this was the February flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| As you see, that's pretty much the same picture, but flooded the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| But a lot of people in Knox County had the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| So next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| So this is a view actually from our house, where we live in the back of the nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| what we call the nature trail going back, and you see the wide area there, the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| That's Connor Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Go ahead, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| And this is our activity trail, which a lot of people in our neighborhood really like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| because you can walk around it, but you can see the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| the walk bridge over Connor Creek is flooded there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| A lot of damage is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| We've already seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| So what I want to point out is what I call the walls of the creek bed are starting to erode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| You see on the left-hand side there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| You know, if you haven't seen before and after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| and honestly I don't have pictures from before Creekside was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| but people that have lived here a long time feel confident that it's getting worse and worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| as far as widening and eroding the creek bed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| There's just another picture that's a little hard to see with the shading on the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| and the right side you see the creek walls that keep on expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| And this, by the way, is the responsibility of Covered Bridge Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| and we stand in talking to Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| I didn't realize Knox County will repair any creek that goes under a county road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| which they would repair the area underneath our bridge on Rustic Bridge Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| but not the creek bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| We're responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Now this is something that just occurred last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| So I'll show you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| This is another developer, Hunter Harrison, who's done a great job at Massey Creek up above ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| and this is just some of the mud and so forth that's coming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| If you hit the next slide, on the other side of the road is this storm drain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| but the key thing here, I know the storm drain water goes to another place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| but between this house and another one I'll show you in the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| This is the back side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| So a couple Sundays ago after church I walked out there to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| while this mud was coming across East Gallagher Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Jim's got a crew out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Actually, today I saw them and stopped and talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Today on East Gallagher Ferry, the mud and the silt from this road that I just showed you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| coming down this vertical steep slope of maybe 70 degrees comes all the way through the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| Hey, Al, I'm going to add that 10 minutes isn't about two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| And we might need to ask for a quick extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| So coming down right there, the riprap they put in is not holding the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| That's the culvert that's going to be put in on East Gallagher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| And all I have to say is I don't know how many feet it is from Massey Creek to there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| but all that mud and all washed on our bridge, now it wasn't a huge problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| but all this is coming down a continual mess for us to contend with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| because we don't think even that was done properly or checked into after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| So those are the things we're concerned about there on Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| We all know about the traffic in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| We're concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| We applaud Ball Homes for working with the county on a proposed roundabout at Hickory Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| at Hardin Valley, East Gallagher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| We think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Is there a contractual commitment there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| We're concerned about overcrowding, and our teacher here from Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| might want to speak to that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| But those are the main things I want to propose to the commission tonight to highly consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| So we thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Again, we're not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| We want it to be proactive and well-planned with future look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| I'll turn it over to Marshall Smith, if that's okay with you guys, unless you have questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Go ahead, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| You've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| I'm Marshall Smith, 2040 Creekside Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| I won't need five minutes because I can't speak that quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| I have one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| I did get to go to the NPC meeting last October, or in October when they voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| and I found it very intriguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I looked at their goals of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| They are seven cities, eight counties, nominated by the Knox County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| And their goals, which I found interesting, was to work and live through responsible development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| to protect neighborhood and greenway efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| to create responsible attitudes about preservation and ensuring neighborhood stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| The goal is to maintain the integrity of a neighborhood supported by the NPC sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| particularly in regards to environmental concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| to work with the community as a whole to ensure quality, responsible, and growth in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| As Alan alluded, we're not against the growth for bottled homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| But these last two are really interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| is to make informed decisions that foster development while being aware of property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| property values, and, again, environmental concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| And the last one on the NPC from the county officials was ensure all citizens have a voice in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| and are treated fairly to the betterment of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| and to make certain the reasonable considerations is given to all parties affected by the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2939)|
| 0:49:06| Again, Alan's already said about the 2.2 recommendation from the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| which, again, it went through two or three votes, which I thought, again, was very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| But I want to speak about bottled homes in our subdivision, which is Creekside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| which, again, was built by bottled homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| I purchased in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| I moved in early in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Believe me, I love the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| But we have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| We still have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| We have drainage and underground leaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| Most of the roads in Creekside are still damaged by the heavy equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| We have track marks everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| We have roads that are buckled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| And I think we have two pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| I actually have a picture that shows that we still have underground leaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| We still have drainage issues when it rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| It don't have to be a hard rain in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| We have water flooding between houses in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| I have erosion, and my property butts up to the backside of the proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| and it makes it very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| In fact, my irrigation system is now exposed to my erosion going down into the proposed thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| But, again, heavy rains that we do have, it's like a flood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| And I want to say the culverts in one place, the culvert is higher than where the water can run off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3020)|
| 0:50:28| and the sediment is already about three to four inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| And I do have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| That's one of the roads right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| In fact, that's the connector road that's already gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| That's actually where the water leak is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| It's been almost two years, the water leak, in the middle of our subdivision as you turn into Creekside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| And that's been talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| It's been brought up, but two years later, we still have that creek, I mean, water flowing out of that hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| The next one you're going to see with the heavy equipment, there's our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| We have several indentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| We have several low areas all the way down to the rock bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| I'm going to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Here's the other thing that is a major, major concern of the Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| where we've met together in the Creekside Manor, is our neighborhood is currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| their plans are currently is to tie into our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| We have one entrance, one way in, one way out, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| We have basically 144 units, times that by number of cars, you're looking at 288 cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| potentially going out and in our neighborhood every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| They're proposing to build a road connecting to our subdivision for some unknown reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| We already have 40 to 50 kids that stand beside Hickory Creek Road every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| We have parents that block both sides of our entrance now coming and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| because they won't let their kids out to stand at the bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| because of the high traffic volume on Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| Again, parents will not let the kids be exposed to the safety hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| The proposed new road will currently take away probably most of the bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| that is currently out in the open now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| We ask you to look at this, the safety concerns that already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Please note that our subdivision, which was again built by Ball Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| currently has zero amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| That includes we do not have a lighted entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| We don't have any street lights, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| or even speed bumps inside our subdivision to slow people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| So I'd ask you again, we're not against this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| but we would ask you that they redefine and go with the MPC recommendation of 2.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| and I appreciate your time, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| I'm sure there's going to be some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Director Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| I've been working on that school bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| I didn't know that Creekside was built by Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| I'm looking for it on your â€‘â€‘| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| We didn't build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| We didn't develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| It was developed by somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| It didn't develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| But it was developed by â€‘â€‘| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| If you're going to go ahead and speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| if you could come up and go ahead and take your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| or address for the record and speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| To address Mr. Biggs's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| we were not the developer of Creekside Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| We bought lots in there and only lots and built homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| All right, go ahead, Mr. Brownian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I know you're speaking on behalf of the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| so I'll go ahead and give you â€‘â€‘| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| I gave them about 15 minutes, so I know you're â€‘â€‘| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I don't think I'll need that long, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I handed a map out to have everybody look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| and I'm going to reference that here directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| As even the opposition has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| Ball Homes is a great builder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| and they always do what they say they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| The issues that I saw them pointing out up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| through their pictures have nothing really to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| with the subdivision that we're putting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| They're talking about subdivisions that were developed by other developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| and I don't think it would be fair in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| to try to attribute some of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| they're having with flooding and so on to Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| Ball Homes has been a very good citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| to the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| They've contributed to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| I think they've had some building projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| that they've helped the schools with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| and they've donated money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| They also, and if you look at your map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| they have agreed to partner with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| and Mr. Snowden is here, and he can speak to that also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| to build this roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Now, the roundabout is going to essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| straighten out Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| and eliminate some of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| that these gentlemen were referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| As you can see, on the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| it doesn't show a street going to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| That's where the main entrance of this subdivision is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| It's not near Creekside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| and the gentleman asked why we were putting a road into Creekside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| It's because MPC is requiring us to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| and I think Mr. Green can verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| It's not a choice of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| We have to go into that nub that's extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| and has a right-of-way that goes into Creekside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3347)|
| 0:55:58| Now, this roundabout that's on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| it's in the county 10-year plan if they choose to fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| but if we put this development in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| it will be built within the next few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| and so that's going to be a tremendous benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| and it costs ball homes money to do projects like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| and do the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| With regard to the density issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| MPC recommended the 2.23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| as has been stated here a couple times before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| but it is less than the average build-out density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| of the surrounding residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| It is at the low end of the zoning densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| and I think it's probably in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| of what the build-out densities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| so the 2.23 is by no means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| it's within the one to five in an up-low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| but it's really at the low end of the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| And in addition to the roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| approximately a third and maybe a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| of this tract of land is going to be green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| They're not going to just pack homes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| So I think that the number was right at 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| but I don't want to get pinned down to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| I think it's at least a third of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| which would make 30 acres or 33 acres, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| And I've had conversations with Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| and we've always been told that it's better to have more density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3448)|
| 0:57:35| in these projects because it really ends up saving land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| and that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| I think everybody in the room, including the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| realizes that this particular tract of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| it's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| It's going to be developed by somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| and you can have it developed by a reputable builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| who builds good homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| or maybe somebody else will come along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| and say they're going to put it at a lower density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| but they may not put a quality home in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| which is going to degrade the value of the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3485)|
| 0:58:14| If you have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Ryan's here to answer anything that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Okay, I'm sure there will be a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| Can you explain to me what this gray block is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| So the gray block is a West Knox Utility District pump station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| They just, as part of sewer improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| they've been making out in the Horn Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| they just built that structure right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| It looks new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| When did they build it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| I was out there yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| They've been building it the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| It's a completed building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| And how is your proposed development tying into the roundabout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| So the fourth leg, if you can imagine the fourth, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| So my question was, I think the answer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| so your entrance would be the fourth leg of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| And you've had the NPCs require connectivity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Similar to what we did at Carnes Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| that everybody disagreed with and now agree with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| So on Creekside Manor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| there's an existing right-of-way that's already platted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| and that's always planned, I believe, to be a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| We're actually on the sector plan discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| I think we're getting into the zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| but it'll probably just be one discussion now since we went this far into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| Have you drawn, what part of your parcel is going to be left green space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| So the majority of the green space would be in the portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| be along Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| There's a creek that runs through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| So that area right there, there's a creek, a flood zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| and several utilities, large utilities run through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| Another large portion is over on Marietta Church Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| on that side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| That's too steep to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| So there's a portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| Yeah, the front of Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| So Marietta Church Road, most of it's on Marietta Church and Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| And then there's also a large portion in the center of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| that the topography is too great to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| It'll be left alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| It'll be left alone, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| This is not planned residential where they have to come back with a site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| It is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| So we're planning on coming back with a concept plan to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| For Ball Homes, Brian, I'm looking at a Google satellite view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| Is the, I guess, single-family farm that's at the corner of Marietta Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| and Hardin Valley, is that also going to be part of your project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| It's right in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| I don't think it's in the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| No, there's a tract there, tract of land, small tract, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| it's 15 or so acres, I believe, with a private home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| And then, Mr. Snowden, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| would you state what your position is on the roundabout and the timetable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| You know, obviously the zoning hasn't been addressed yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| but once we do get a number of lots and a traffic study is created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| what we've discussed with Ball Homes is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| much like we've done with other developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| we want to have a fair and prorated share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| so the amount of trips that they would generate would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| as part of the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| would give us an indication of how much, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| financial support that they would provide for the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| And certainly, as Mr. Valiant stated, you know, this is on our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| It's something we'd like to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| but their financial contribution would move it up the list a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| further than what it maybe would otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| And the timetable would be if, once approval is done with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| you would go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| We would need to ask this body for a budget request for capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| construction dollars next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| We could start a design prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| but as far as any large-scale construction of that roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| it would need to occur in fiscal year 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| And I'm going to go to Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| and then I might have a question or two myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Mr. Green, I just want to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| I'm looking at your information, but I just want to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| The development just to the left that I believe it's called Creekside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| it is 2.88 units per acre, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| 3.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| And then across the street, Hubbard Bridge is 1.8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| 1.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| They're actually developed as two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Was there zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| They're developed as two separate developments and traded density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| A portion of it is 1.54 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| and another portion is 2.64 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| but the average is 1.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| And then across the street, sort of across the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| you've got another one, Poplar Meadow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| that looks like up to three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| I think that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| I don't have the built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| I don't have the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| 1.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| 1.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| But the development that essentially this is going to tie into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| which is Creekside, is 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| And right now, the contention here is somewhere between 2.3 and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| And the staff based its recommendation on the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| 77 of the 117 acres of this tract is classified as a sloped area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| with grades more than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Because of that green space in the front and the slope area above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| and basically unusable portion of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| So it gets packed in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| I just wanted that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| And Mr. Green, you kind of were getting to my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| I went out and visited a property yesterday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| and I noticed on the front side that runs roughly parallel to Covered Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| you've got a creek that I think flows all the way into a cattailed kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| retention pond over next to the adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| So I'm believing that that creek area would probably prevent some development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| on the front footage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| Then right up to the, as you're looking at the proposed traffic circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| if you come down from it and go to about 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| I think that was where the driveway was for what was probably a farmhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| or that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| I noticed that that area is somewhat, when I got up on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| I could actually look down on the rest of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| So is that kind of where the slope area that would probably not be when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| plan comes through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| And I may even ask the developers to kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| I know we're not at the point to see the plans yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| but is that some of the area that we're talking about where the main slope is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| or is that primarily in the back area away from where the creek was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| That I can't answer because I have not seen a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| And although we may use the slope analysis to determine a suggested density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| we don't prohibit the disturbance of slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| So they can grade the entire site if they want to incur that cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| and those challenges to develop whatever density they're permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Do you guys have any comments on that, on what your take is on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| I mean, as far as the slopes, the most sloped portions of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| the steepest portions are along Marietta Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| So, you know, the Fulger McIndoe has been working on this for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| Nothing they come up with showed us ever disturbing that property over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| And then, like you said, the portion along Hickory Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| that is a state or the state's taking jurisdiction over that stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| so that would always have to be left alone, that area down in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| So right now, Fulger McIndoe is still working on a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| Like Mr. Vance said, we don't intend to, about a third of this property, we don't intend to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Mr. Snowden, and I remind everybody, we're still on sector plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| We're talking a lot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| Yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| We're talking about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| You know, the sector plan will probably be an easy vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| but we're talking about the second vote, which is the deeper dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| On this road improvement project, I know you haven't had time for bids or studies or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| but in your mind, being the expert that you are, what is your rough dollar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4051)|
| 1:07:38| What do you expect this project to come in at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| The last couple of roundabouts we built were about $500,000 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| That's been a couple of years ago, and as we all know, construction costs and competitive nature has thrown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| This has some new road sections to it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| I mean, I would estimate somewhere probably around $750,000 to construct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| because we're going to have to extend, you're right, all three roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| We won't obviously do the development road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| but at least three of the roads will have some new alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| So I would think, you know, less than a million, but probably around $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| Any utilities that will have to be relocated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| We worked with West Knox in regard to de-conflicting their large sewer line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| There will probably be obviously some overhead electric from LCUB and some various other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| But at least right now, we don't anticipate any really significant utility relocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4114)|
| 1:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Director Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| LDR on the sector plan is fairly normal for this track here, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| You know, as someone that has driven through Hardin Valley since I was 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| I had a good friend live down here off the West Gallaher Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| This has always been a very dangerous section of road right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| At some point, this land will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| It would be nice to get good participation from a developer on a major road improvement in this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4155)|
| 1:09:26| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| This project I think I heard earlier was in the 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| It's been something that obviously we've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Our plans don't run out that far, but, yeah, it's in our scope of projects, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| Or is it in the really hope-wish list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| Right now, I mean, the intersection, as unusual as it is, isn't exhibiting a significant amount of crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| So, yeah, it wouldn't necessarily be at the top of our list if not for potential participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| And if this went through, it could move it up to within a year or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| I would think so, yes, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| because just the cost-benefit would be greatly adjusted due to the participation of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Mr. Hickey, out of the $750,000, it's going to cost how much is Ball Homes committing to the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4223)|
| 1:10:31| So the model we've been looking at with Mr. Snowden is what I believe the county has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| with some other roundabouts and developers in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| I think that figure is based on the amount of volume that this development would be adding to the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4242)|
| 1:10:53| And then maybe Mr. Snowden can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| But they take that traffic number and how much additional volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| and they put a percentage of that we would be responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| I'd also like to point out that part of this road improvement is going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| would use up a portion of the 117 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| So there is some land there that, you know, we'd be using up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4277)|
| 1:11:27| And to further clarify to what Ryan's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| once the zoning is set and the density is set, then the traffic study can be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| And we have used other developments to where it's all about trips generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| and how much trips are going to be coming into that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| So once we have their trip generation numbers, we can accurately assign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| and fairly assign a cost percentage that they would be responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| And we would work with that such that the cost occurred would be such, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| every bit of construction, right-of-way, anything that the county incurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| Let's say that, for instance, there are 25% of trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| If it turns out to be $1 million throughout that entire process, they would give us $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| So it would be a prorated share based on actual cost as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| So it seemed to be a good model for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| We used it in Commissioner Schoonmaker's district on a set of apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| and ended up getting a traffic signal installed at Westland at Emory Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| What percentage was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| What percentage do you expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| That's real tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| That's real tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Put me on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| I would need to do a little further analysis on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Director Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| The road was closed out there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Can you give me what's going on out there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| And Mr. Heal mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| There was a lady that brought a concern to our attention about water sheeting across the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| where there should have been a tile installed there that never was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| I mean, a lot of old county roads, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| they weren't necessarily designed like what you would like for them to be in today's times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| So we are installing a cross drain or a pipe that's under the road, and that did require the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| But we should be completed with that this week and have traffic back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| And in doing so, you know, resolve the unsafe condition for the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| as well as install an energy dissipator on the downstream side to prevent further erosion on the covered bridge property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4404)|
| 1:13:32| So that's specifically for covered bridge property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| It was kind of a combination of the subdivision upstream of there as well as them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| So it should resolve the safety concern for the water sheeting across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I just want to make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| What we're talking about and what our first vote would be is about the sector plan, not about zoning levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| I mean, the next step will be I'll probably look for a motion from Commissioner Anders to approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| that it's not approving any level of zoning or density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| And then after that, we can move on to a little bit more brass tacks on this particular discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| But anyhow, Allen, yes, would you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| Is it in order that we have just a chance to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| All the questions seem to be addressed to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| Would it be okay if we had a couple minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| You know, most of us are working people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| A few of us folks are retired, but we don't have eight to five every day to spend hours meeting with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| and Jim Stone's group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| We go to planning commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| We take time off to go to their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Thankfully, you guys meet at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| But it's difficult for the constituents and the residents of Hardin Valley to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| so we'd like just a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Two or three people want to comment, but I'll also say that we applaud the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| I've said for a long time since we've lived out there, we need a roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| and I think that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| I appreciate their participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| I want to hear Mr. Stone in a minute talk about what's going to be done to the stormwater runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| and what he just described with Commissioner Biggs asking the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| because here's the real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| Jim, you guys might have notified by sending a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| but that water in that culvert is coming on the property of our cover bridge common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| And I don't know if you all sent a letter to our box that didn't get read, an email to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| but it wasn't until I saw the signs, which was good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| that we even realized the water's coming on our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| And then, honestly, today, I know the guy's name, but the guy on the site today said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| And we'll probably be back out here fixing another thing, putting another tile in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| because the water's going to come through, because Massey Creek didn't do what they should have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| It's going to have to be diverted even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| They are putting, diverting riprap there, but, see, we're concerned about after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| And so I want to say that we've got two people who want to speak very quickly, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| Alan, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| I'd also, you'd mentioned you all had a couple more, quote, unquote, questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| So you just brought up a few different things, but you also said you had a couple of very specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| No questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| I had a couple of responses there based on the questions they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| I'll allow them, but let's be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| I don't want you all to leave here feeling like you haven't been heard, to be quite frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| My name is Joe Bubar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| I live at 2109 Muddy Creek Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| It's in the Hunter Valley, Hunter Way Valley, part of the valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| We've lived there three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Our home was built three years ago, and I think the development was built over the last three to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| I want to thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| I'm just learning my way through the Knox County and community, and we love what we see and what we're a part of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4609)|
| 1:16:57| I heard a few things, and then I would like to just comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| One is that we have a great concern for what our community needs and wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| I heard that earlier, and I trust that we will really carefully consider that, that you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| What is good for our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| I'm delighted to know that there's a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| I've lived in parts of America where roundabouts work, but it's going to take more than a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| When I see children getting off to come up our street, which has 40 homes, they get off the bus, the bus stops on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4645)|
| 1:17:34| I live now in a part of the country which really doesn't seem, this is an observation, doesn't seem to value speed limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4654)|
| 1:17:44| Therefore, I am of great concern for just the traffic patterns that are going on along Hardin Valley Road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4664)|
| 1:17:55| I would comment I am grateful that we are concerned about the well-being of our land and not using up any more than we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4675)|
| 1:18:04| I'm not sure, sirs and ma'ams, that I follow the logic that by putting more houses on an acre, we're going to save land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4684)|
| 1:18:13| Because I'm watching one development after another, and I love them, I moved into a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| That's not my issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| But my concern is that that's really not part of the rational thinking of our community, trying to squeeze more in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4700)|
| 1:18:31| I appreciate your time. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Ma'am, if you could state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| I'm Kristen Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| I live at 2223 Muddy Creek Lane in Hunter's Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| I live in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| I'm also a second grade teacher at Hardin Valley Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| I just want to give you a little snapshot into our extremely overcrowded elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| Due to our overcrowding, we're so overcapacity that we have almost 200 students outside in portable classrooms, including me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4736)|
| 1:19:04| We have no art or music classrooms because those classrooms have been turned into regular ed classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| So all art and music is taught on carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| So our kids are getting art and music lessons, no instruments, no pianos, no easels, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| If it doesn't fit on a cart, they're not being instructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| The larger classrooms have been turned into double classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| So we have two teachers, two classes of kids in one room, over 40 kids in one classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4766)|
| 1:19:36| In our cafeteria, we are over fire codes with the number of kids in the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| We have kids sitting at folding tables and folding chairs because we don't have enough regular tables and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| My portable, just to give you an idea, is 22 by 20 feet, 22 by 20 feet square feet big, which is probably smaller than some of the living rooms they're putting in these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4787)|
| 1:20:05| And I have 22 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| I started at Hardin Valley five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| I was on a team of nine second grade teachers, and I had 19 kids in my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| Five years later, I am on a team of 10 second grade teachers with 22 kids in my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| And that is across all grade levels, kindergarten through fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| So I just wanted to give you that snapshot into our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| And I invite you to come spend a day in my 20-square-foot portable with 22 seven-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| And then go sit on some folding chairs in our cafeteria and eat lunch with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| One more, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| I'm a person of very few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Anyway, I'm Paul Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| I live at 2444 Covered Bridge Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| The only thing I've got to say, basically, is I know that they hired a study of this property, paid a bazillion dollars for it or whatever the county pays for these studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4857)|
| 1:21:12| And they came back with 1.88 recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| And then we want to go to 3.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| I mean, just think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Why are we going to 3.5 or why are we going over 1.88 if we paid a lot of money to have this study done, have professionals tell us this is what should be done, and then we don't follow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4883)|
| 1:21:35| To me, that doesn't make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Back to our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| The resolution that is requested for us is actually an update to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| It's an amendment from what is currently agriculture HP to LDR HP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| So we're not talking about density or the build while the discussion has covered most of the plot points around this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4917)|
| 1:22:07| There will be no vote with the request that's before us on actual density to clarify that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4927)|
| 1:22:15| Is there any additional discussion as it relates to the change in the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| The chair would like to entertain a motion as it relates to item 49, 10-E-19-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4943)|
| 1:22:32| Item number 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| I'll make a motion that we approve 10-E-19-SP, which is a sector plan recommendation by the Knox Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| We have a proper motion from Commissioner Anders and a second from Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| So now, forgive me, I said 49 earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| I was looking at our work session notes when I was flipping through my book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| So, Madam Clerk, what's the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| The next item is 10-H-19-RZ, which is the request of Ball Homes, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4990)|
| 1:23:17| for rezoning from A, agricultural, to PR plan residential zoning at a density up to 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=4997)|
| 1:23:24| And the property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| So, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| And I know there is opposition present to this, as we have discussed both of those items at the prior resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5014)|
| 1:23:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| Is there any discussion on the, we have discussed the zoning agnosium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| but I know that was not what we were voting on the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| But go ahead, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Well, I think that, Ryan, can you step up, please, to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| I'm looking on KGIS, and I can't project it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| But at the last lot in Creekside, kind of where you're cutting through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| or the proposed cut through is on Chirping Bird and Creekside Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| This is the Hardin Valley Land Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| That's not you all, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| That's Rusty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| That's Rusty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| And I kind of wrote down some of the concerns and went through some of the emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| that we've received, the numerous emails that we've received over the last couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| You know, one of the concerns was traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| I'm sorry, Ryan, you can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| I was just asking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| I didn't know if that was yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| I had an idea about that partial right there I was going to talk to you about later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5078)|
| 1:24:46| You know, we hear the issues with traffic, school overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5086)|
| 1:24:55| You know, Knox County has grown itself into a huge rush hour that used to last 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| Now it lasts two or three hours in the morning, two or three hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| or a couple hours in the morning, three or four hours in the afternoon, all over town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| North Shore, Tazewell Pike, East Emory, West Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| Carnes Valley is a mile back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| I'd love to have this roundabout at Bankton Solway and Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Jim won't build me one, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| It's T-Dot Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| You know, then we talk about the school overcrowding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| and when she first talked about the portables, and I hate portable classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| I wish we didn't have any in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| But, you know, Coryton Elementary, half their school has been in portables for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| Powell Elementary School, half their school has been in portables that are 30 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| And Adrian Burnett was a temporary school on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| But there's a new school proposed, a new elementary school proposed for this very reason in this very district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| They're trying to spot that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| That will relieve Hardin Valley's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| The high school issue can be cured as well with capacity at other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| All of the issues that are brought up were valid issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| but all of those have been addressed more quickly in this area right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| than they have been in most parts of the county, with the exception of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| We talk about property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| Covered Bridge is one of the prettiest places in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| but not many people can afford to live in a Covered Bridge type neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| It's beautiful, and if I could live there, I certainly would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| because I think it's one of the most attractive places in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| But to argue about property values in Hardin Valley is very difficult to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| when they're increasing at the rate of 15%, 20%, 30% over the last three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| I don't know that we need to have high density in the range of 3.5 or 4 on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5214)|
| 1:27:04| but I certainly think there's probably a compromise that maybe even mirrors Creekside Manor's density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| Going back to the connection, there was really a tough discussion three or four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5230)|
| 1:27:19| I guess, Gerald, I don't know if it was three or four years ago or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| but over near Carnes Middle where Smithville had a subdivision they built in the 70s and 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| and then came back and finished it out, and MPC made them connect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| And people were up in arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| And then once they connected, I had two people at the Carnes Fair two years later say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| man, it's so much easier to get out of my neighborhood now that we've connected these two neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| So, I mean, these are difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| These are emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| These are everybody's biggest investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| But I think we can probably find a compromise number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| And I'm not going to sit and listen to any more discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| but I just wanted my district to know how I kind of felt about the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| I think Commissioner Bussler and that's Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| I'm not sure who came on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Was that you, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| I had the pleasure of sitting in on last month's Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| and it was an interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| It was 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| Gerald, it was a long discussion on this density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| And we even have developers on the Planning Commission that seem that 3.5 is not a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| The first motion by Mr. Clancy was 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| It got nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| So he come back with three and it got nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| And he said, I see the writing on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| He made it 2.33 and it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| So that's just a little history of what happened during a long discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| It was a long, long discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| I don't see 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| Sitting in on the meeting with KNOX Planning, it needs to be a lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| Now, whatever Brad comes up with, he looks at that lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| I may agree with it and I may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| We'll see what he comes up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| But 3.5 or 3, to me personally, is not a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| If you've been out and took a look at the property that you're talking about developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| there are some places on there that you can't build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| It will be left over for green space and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| Mr. Snowden, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| Let's see all know all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| If you saw the pictures before of the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| and even in February when we had the big floodings and things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| if nothing is done right now to redirect the water and things of that sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| we're going to continue to have flooding out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| How will this development help that direction of that water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| away from some of these problem areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| Would that be considered when we're doing that development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| I don't know if it would necessarily help it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| but certainly we won't allow it to make it any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| We would control peak flow discharge to ensure that downstream neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| didn't receive additional water that could cause erosion on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| So we would ensure that it didn't make it any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| But we could direct and slow down some of the water flow in that area, correct, with that development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| Our detention or stormwater ordinance requires for extreme flood protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| which means our ponds are required to hold the 100-year storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| So yes, there would be, during those storms that are less than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| that they would see a reduced peak flow discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| I've got a, I'll qualify this as under a dumb question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| but it's really for the Covered Bridge folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| There was a question or statement about an area that got flooding that was the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| My dumb question is, is that the area where the caves are and is that in the floodplain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| So, Mr. Hill, or would one of the residents address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| I'm just trying to get that squared away in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| So the area of our activity trail, grass in the middle, track around asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| the Connors Creek comes around, and on the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| the west side of the big hillside that goes up toward our villas, that's where the cave is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| Well, I mean, I know where the cave is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| I've been in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| So, no, I was not trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| It is locked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| It is locked up, so somebody must have given you the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| Yeah, I've been in a cave there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| I took some scouts there a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| But, so, is that the area that you're talking about that flooded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| It says that cave area is pretty low, and I know it almost looks like it's down in the floodplain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| You know, the cave that I'm referring to, the one that's locked up, that's what I'm talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| because it's a field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| The one that's locked up is probably 100 feet up the hill from the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| It's very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| Maybe I'm thinking about one that is kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| Well, I know where you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| I know you go through that bridge, the covered bridge, the covered bridge, and it's down on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| Well, so, maybe that's one I don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| I do know, however, some of the flood that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| Does anybody in the neighborhood know what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| A low cave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| One that's lower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Or the higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| I know the higher one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| Are you talking about the land or the cave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| Well, I was trying to, in my mind, see exactly where you're talking about the flooding is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| because that low cave, which is to the left of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| that's an area that appears to be in a flood plain down there, at least in a low-lying area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| And there's access to a cave down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Parts of that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| Parts of that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| And we realize the pictures for the February flood were much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| We've had major floods that I don't have pictures of outside of the February flood, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Is there any additional discussion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| I think what Commissioner Anders laid out was probably the ten bullet points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| and the highlights of everybody's challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| And there will always be, I feel like we've had this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| at least I've been here for a year and several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| and we've probably had this discussion about Hardin Valley every month for a year and several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| And I feel like we're going to have it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| And this is the nature of a growing community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| But there is always compromise and there's always challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| because infrastructure doesn't always come before development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| and development doesn't always wait for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| And we're in a fine balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| You all live in neighborhoods that were somebody else's view, were somebody else's farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| were somebody else's runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| And they all had the same discussion where they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| don't build that because it's going to affect my neighborhood down the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| And so we do our best to mitigate that and let everybody live together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| We all have investments in our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| We all have investments that we want to see, and we all have communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| But I think you all know that it is a fine balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| It's not a valid argument to say I'm the last one in and we'll do our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| So our county commission has worked very hard to approve money for new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| We've worked hard to find more money for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| And I think that when I look at all of this and I listen to everybody at the table today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| I do think there is a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| And so I'd like to make a motion to essentially mirror what is right next door at Creekside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| That is a development that many of you all live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| It seems to be a community that is a little bit of a density model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| especially since about 25% of this property is not going to be able to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| So I'll put a motion on the table to move things forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| and make a motion to approve zoning at the same density as Creekside at 2.8 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5723)|
| 1:35:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| Seconded by Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| So we have the motion on the floor is 2.8 acres by Commissioner Jay, seconded by Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| 2.8 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Which, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| 2.8 per acre, not 2.8 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Sorry, yeah, 2.8 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| I just feel like that's an appropriate compromise between where the current zoning sits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| and where the developer wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| And, of course, I don't know if we can put that on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| or have that contingent upon the investment in the roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| which I think is a huge community asset that will really help with both traffic flow and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| Is that an appropriate addendum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| I'll look to Daniel for a clearer direction on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| I think that would be a condition more appropriate to the development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5782)|
| 1:36:30| It's just a little bit too vague, too unknown what that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5790)|
| 1:36:38| You're talking about the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| There's some looking over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| I'm going to go ahead and call on Commissioner Daley since his light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| Mr. Green, what's the difference in the number of units there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| I don't have that total acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| That's about half a unit per acre, so at 117 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| that would be approximately 58 additional units between what the Planning Commission recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5821)|
| 1:37:09| and what the County Commission is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| And I've got the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| Is 2.88 acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5843)|
| 1:37:32| Yeah, I think we can still make this development work, make it feasible for us at 2.8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| and that would also give us room to be able to fund a portion of the road improvements needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5858)|
| 1:37:46| So I think that's a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| You should go to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Director Green, what was the amount that MPC Commission recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5878)|
| 1:38:07| 2.23 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| And you say it's 50 more units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| It's about, with the proposal by the County Commission, it's about 58 more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Would that in any way affect the requirement of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| The road improvements would be dependent on the outcome of the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| and that's obviously impacted by the number of units, traffic generated by those units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| is estimated on so many trips per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| So there would be some impact on the amount of road improvements required based on the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5917)|
| 1:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| So if we stuck with the original, we would expect to get less, if any, help on the road project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5925)|
| 1:38:53| Probably less, I think, would be a reasonable assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| There would be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| The traffic generated by smaller development would be a larger percentage of the overall traffic using that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Yes, back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| Sir, representing, I wanted to ask you if you could come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| I'm sorry, I didn't know your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| That's Alan Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| I'm sorry, I didn't remember your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Just in respect of we've asked our development applicant if that's a compromise they're comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| I want to make sure we ask our neighbors in Hardin Valley if they also feel like that is a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| The motion's on the floor and we'll vote against it, but I also want you to have an opportunity to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| Well, Commissioner, I applaud you for asking because we were sitting here wondering if we were going to get a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| so I honestly applaud you for that, especially since you're one of the at-large commissioners representing the entire county of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5983)|
| 1:39:50| So we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| We're concerned because the staff that you guys, we all pay for as taxpayers, recommended 1.88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| The commission, in a long meeting that Commissioner Daley talked about, came up with 2.23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| We've come up with a recommendation of 2.8, which is, I think, 2.8, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| Not 2.88, but 2.80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| So we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| We don't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| Honestly, it should be 1.88, but we're willing to hang in there with the 2.23 that the full planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6018)|
| 1:40:26| after different iterations, came to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| As a matter of fact, I think a point might be a reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| We had the agenda minutes today, and the applicant requested 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| Commissioner Clancy, his first motion was for 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| It was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| 2.5 was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Then, after I think Elizabeth Eason, who's a landscape architect, as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| said that she could only live with maybe the 2.3, 2.3, that's when it was finalized at 2.23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| So there's been tons of discussion that's gone into this already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| and we're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Again, we applaud the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| We know traffic's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| We haven't heard enough discussion about water runoff, stormwater, environmental studies, and the like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6066)|
| 1:41:13| because of what we've seen so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| We know a flood comes, a flood comes, but we're really concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| and maybe this comes up in the conceptual plan, concept plan later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| because I don't understand how the project works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| If that's the case, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| We can deal with that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| I think our job is not to litigate in the rears of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| We get the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| We do the best we can to put bodies together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| but there's a lot of process between now and when it would go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| use and review, concept plans and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| We understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Essentially, now what we're trying to do is find a way forward for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Alan, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Alan, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| Sorry, I didn't try to get you before you sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| Was the roundabout ever discussed with the neighborhood at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| or is this a new thing tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| As a matter of fact, I applaud Ryan for meeting with us on a Saturday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| at the Covered Bridge Clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Came over, did a great job, spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| I'm sure he'd rather been doing other things on a good Saturday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| this late August or September, whenever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| When they told us that, as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| Kim Frazier had met with them, and she's done a great job, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| advocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| She told us a roundabout was planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| Jim was nice enough to send me a concept of what that would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| from a sketch, not a finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| And so we applaud that and are honestly glad they're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| That's super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| I hoped that when that happened, that could be done and the barn saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| I'm still about saving that barn, too, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| We can talk about that another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| It's a beautiful barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| So, yes, we like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| It's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| It'll help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| I've told many, many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| I've lived here since 1966, and I've seen the whole bedroom community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| of North Shore Drive grow up when Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| extended Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| And I drove down North Shore today all the way from Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| pretty much Lines View, to Pellissippi to go to the airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| and it's still hardly any wider than it was in 1966| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| when I played baseball at Alki Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| And I don't have any hopes, honestly, Jim, of Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| being any wider, though it can be safer with turn lanes, roundabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| So stormwater runoff is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| Schools is something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| We know that's planned for 2022 if things go good for that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| Yeah, I just kind of wanted to, I mean, to me, that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| I mean, it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| There's many more places that it's needed just as bad as it is right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| on that spot in Knox County, and it's not going to happen without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| We applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Probably a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Thank you, Alan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6233)|

| 1:47:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| This is a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| You don't change your name, you don't do nothing here on this next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6429)|

| 1:47:19| also a request of Eric Wellsford for Wellsford Properties General Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| for rezoning from R.B. General Residential to P.C. Planned Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| and the property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6452)|

| 1:47:35| By a vote of 11-0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| the Planning Commission recommended approval of the planned commercial zoning for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| this property subject to the condition that a type A landscaping screen be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| installed along any shared boundaries with residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| This would allow the property to be developed in a way that's compatible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6475)|

| 1:47:58| So state your name and address again for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| I am Eric Wellsford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| I live at 2214 McCampbell-Wells Way in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| And unless the opposition has broken down the door in the last minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| I see no opposition to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| So the Chair will entertain a motion on this from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| I want to thank Mr. Brellsford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| We've had a couple of discussions about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| and residential development is unlikely in this part of the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6502)|
| 1:48:28| but I think the development that Mr. Brellsford has planned will be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| So I'll make a motion that we approve this request per the recommendation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6516)|

| 1:48:40| It was seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| There is additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6522)|

| 1:48:52| Yeah, he used to kick my butt in ping pong, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| By the way, I now have a silver and gold medal in senior Olympics in ping pong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| I've thrown the gauntlet down, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| Then we'll have to play again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| For sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6546)|

| 1:49:11| That's a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6551)|

| 1:52:39| Before I start, I don't see the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| I don't see the applicant on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| I'm going to see if he sent me an email or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| That's not like Ben Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6766)|

| 1:52:48| So does Mr. Beeler want to deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| I think we'll follow up for a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| Move to the back of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6776)|

| 1:53:09| Nobody's showing that Mr. Mullins has reached out on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| I'm seeing if I've got a last-minute email on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| Yeah, I haven't seen anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| Has it reached out to you at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| No, I would just say that we move it to next month if that's agreeable with the Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| Historically, we've got a process for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| I didn't see him, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| And I haven't heard anything from him either that he wasn't coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| The Chair usually sends a letter, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| Yeah, we do have a formal letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6826)|

| 1:53:57| I'll make a motion that the Chair send a letter to Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| We'll move it to the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| Okay, so we have a motion to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| I was looking at Commissioner Daley, so I'll go ahead and grant him a second on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| So, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6855)|

| 1:54:18| To formally restate that motion, that was to send a letter from the Chair that this will be carried forward to the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6858)|
| 1:54:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6867)|

| 1:54:29| Drusilla, can you compose said letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6869)|

| 1:54:38| Commissioner Buehler, I believe your intent was for that to apply to both items 43 and 44, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| All right, Madam Clerk, next item, 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| It's 10-R-19-RZ, request of B&B Builder for rezoning from PR Plan Residential and F Floodway zoning at a density up to 4 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6887)|

| 1:55:24| or zoning for this property at a density of 5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| finding it would be compatible with the second plan and would be a minor increase in the existing density approved of 4 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6928)|
| 1:55:36| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6936)|

| 1:55:58| I'm still trying to get over the Growth Brooks concert, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| We're basically just wanting to go with the MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| It's a minor increase in density, so it shouldn't be a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6972)|

| 1:56:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| I want to make a motion that we approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6980)|

| 1:56:29| Up to 5 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| You already see what's out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| You already see what's out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| They've done a great, great development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| I wouldn't think we'd be pushing it at all to get any more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| No, I'm not talking about getting any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| I mean, how much more land do you have to develop out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| Hey, listen, I'm just trying to hold you here longer because you enjoyed this so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| I knew that you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| He can substantiate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| You've made the motion and I've recognized the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| The second is from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| Additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| Gerald, I heard four from you and five on the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| Did I mishear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| It's five dwelling units per acre is the request and the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| It's currently zoned at four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Just confirm and make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| It's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| So, yeah, so it is five, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| You wanted a restatement of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| Yeah, looking at the map, what is currently on the front part of that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| I believe it's townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| What density are they at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| They're at four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| It has to be less than four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7068)|
| 1:57:57| This will allow continued development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7080)|
| 1:58:10| We haven't voted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| The light just went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| I wasn't sure if there was a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| Is there any other questions or discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| Gerald, would you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Clarify it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| You said it's got to be less than five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| It's the request and the recommendation is for up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| And you said something has to be less than five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| To Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| What's there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| It's four or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| So it's four or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| But what's there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| And that just will allow an increase in additional units to be developed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| I mean, it's at four and we want to go up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| Four to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| One, two, three, four, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7134)|
| 1:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| Great night not to have an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| So we've got an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| We have an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| All we need to do is have first reading and then we need to set the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| So, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| It's an ordinance amending the Knox County Code Appendix A zoning, Article 2, Section 2.20, specific terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7155)|
| 1:59:23| Article 5, Section 5.38.03, uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| and Article 4, to add a new Section 4.106, standards for the use on review approval of microbreweries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7168)|
| 1:59:35| in the CN Neighborhood Commercial District and Subsection 4.106.01, minimum requirements to define microbreweries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7175)|
| 1:59:44| to identify them as a subject to use on review approval in the CN Neighborhood Commercial District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7189)|
| 1:59:58| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| That was pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| The first motion had one come in from Commissioner Anders and it came in from Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| So, I'm going to go ahead and recognize Commissioner Anders for the first, Commissioner Schoonmaker for the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| Well, it came out of my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| Well, it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| It originated from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Well, we're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| We'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Commissioner Smith, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| I was just going to give a quick overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Most of you may be familiar with the Choteau Markets development at the intersection of Choteau Road and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7228)|
| 2:00:35| It has a Weigel's, a Don Gallo's, a Tenova Healthcare Center, and that was all developed by one developer, John Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7235)|
| 2:00:44| And so what they wanted to do was do an establishment to sell basically craft beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7244)|
| 2:00:52| But I think the regulations in place that MPC has come up with, with less than 3,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| and only up to 50% of the building can only be used for the actual beer tanks or whatever they're actually called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7258)|
| 2:01:07| and it makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| And then the other restriction is they can only produce 3,000, is it barrels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7268)|
| 2:01:14| Barrels per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| Per year, which is pretty amazing if you start to think through that for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| But it's a way to kind of, that area has only really one restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| and it's a way to kind of build something there for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| Historically, I want everybody to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| Historically, that little discussion that we had eight, nine years ago, neighborhoods were totally against that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7297)|
| 2:01:45| Was that the Overby one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| No, it was Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| No, that Overby one didn't get passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| Everybody that came out in opposition to this thing, and look at the success and the beauty of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| I think it was done very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| And I think it's just an illustration of good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7320)|
| 2:02:07| Huber followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| I don't think you were here when we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| I don't think it was sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| But, I mean, Huber followed the neighborhood commercial and Farragut stipulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| He did everything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| And everybody that opposed that thing probably goes over to Don Gallego all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| And I think it's just a wonderful little setup over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| Well, it's amazing, though, back then, too, how many people on the front had to say, I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7343)|
| 2:02:29| But behind the scenes, they were all in favor of it because they didn't want to go drive five miles to get a gallon of gasoline to mow their lawn on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7349)|
| 2:02:39| And, of course, now we have the rural metro fire station there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| So it's really been a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7367)|

| 2:02:49| You know, that is a great development, but this is something that will affect more than that one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| Director Green, could you get us a map that shows all the locations of neighborhood commercial currently in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| There are 11 locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| There are two east Knox County, one on Washington Pike right at the edge of city limits, one on Red Litch Pike at Chiptown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7382)|
| 2:03:13| There are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven in the northwest sector from a couple near Cedar Bluff right on the edge of city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7393)|
| 2:03:27| Two around Carnes, one on Oak Ridge Highway near Solway, one off Pellissippi Parkway just halfway between Hardin Valley and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7407)|
| 2:03:40| There are two in the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7420)|

| 2:03:51| And of those, I think there's a vacant property in two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| So there are 11 neighborhood commercials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| And they're going to be on Shawn Road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| In neighborhood commercial, are bars currently allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7444)|

| 2:04:14| Restaurants that serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| Under this proposal, will these be food-serving places and will they have on-premise sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| They'll have on-premise sales of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| There's no requirement that they serve food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7470)|

| 2:04:34| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| This will need to be a roll call vote as it's in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118zoning?start=7476)|
