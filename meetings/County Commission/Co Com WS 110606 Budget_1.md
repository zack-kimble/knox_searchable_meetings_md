| 2:49:47| I don't know what you have and what you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| And I think that that's what's happened to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| We don't know, so we need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| Moving on down through, I appreciate your explanation on the differences in the numbers that we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10200)|
| 2:50:08| running from a half a million to $700,000 on what funds may be on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10208)|
| 2:50:16| The thing that I was kind of taken aback at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10216)|
| 2:50:23| is you're saying that the county may have spent a couple million dollars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10223)|
| 2:50:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10229)|
| 2:50:30| On capital funds, on enlargement of our building, yes, and equipping the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10230)|
| 2:50:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10238)|
| 2:50:39| And I don't know then what all of the other numbers are made up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10239)|
| 2:50:45| but I see a lot of attentive ears way back on the back row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10245)|
| 2:50:50| I was more in tune to maybe there could have been county money spent there in the four to four and a half million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10250)|
| 2:50:58| That would be a shock to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| But if someone has those figures, I'll stand corrected if you can show them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10262)|
| 2:51:07| And that's what I would like for us to be presented with, the amounts of money that have been spent on Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10267)|
| 2:51:18| I think that's all the questions I have right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| Mr. Cohen, if you could send a copy of what you have of that Memorandum of Understanding to our commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| then she can send it out to each of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| Could I interject here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10288)|
| 2:51:31| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| And maybe this is something for Jolie to research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| I actually have a copy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| The title of it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10297)|
| 2:51:38| A Resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10298)|
| 2:51:41| Approving a Memorandum of Understanding with the Beck Cultural Exchange Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| Making the Beck Center Part of the Knox County Library System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| That's the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10309)|
| 2:51:50| The number is R-04-7-203, Requested by Community Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10310)|
| 2:51:59| It was approved in July of 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10319)|
| 2:52:02| Now, I'm betting that the memorandum, this is a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10322)|
| 2:52:06| I'm betting that the memorandum is an attachment to that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| So just for you all's information, that's probably the best way to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| That way Jolie can send it out electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| She'll check that out in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| Yeah, because if Mr. Cohen has it, it's going to be a PDF copied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| so it will be great to go back to the original document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10348)|
| 2:52:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| I've now glanced down at my paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10352)|
| 2:52:35| You said you welcomed an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| And I know we've heard this or seen it in press, speaking of an audit of Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| Who is auditing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| Who, for commission's perusal, who is auditing Beck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10364)|
| 2:52:51| Well, I was going to bring it up in our commission meeting to ask the audit committee to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| And so that's our procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| And I was going to have that on the agenda for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10378)|
| 2:53:02| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10384)|
| 2:53:05| I don't really have anything else to add other than to maybe comment on Commissioner's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10385)|
| 2:53:10| You asked very good questions, and I'll be eagerly awaiting those questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10390)|
| 2:53:15| But just for general information, once this document was signed, other than the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10395)|
| 2:53:23| and I'll encourage you to read the memorandum, other than the confusion over the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10403)|
| 2:53:29| and I do think that there was confusion on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| I mean, because it clearly should have been a joint venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10412)|
| 2:53:35| If you read the memorandum, it should have been a joint venture to get this document prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10415)|
| 2:53:40| That all other elements were in place, and they were operating under Larry Frank and the Knox County Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10420)|
| 2:53:48| I mean, that was Mr. Rollins' boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10428)|
| 2:53:51| I mean, he reported to Larry Frank, and his employees reported up through him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10431)|
| 2:53:57| PBA was taking care of the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| All of the elements were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| So I don't want there to be confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10441)|
| 2:54:05| And I do appreciate, I think, Commissioner Briggs, I shall say, not necessarily the operational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10445)|
| 2:54:11| because the operational should have been captured under the library services account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10451)|
| 2:54:16| So I just wanted to, again, just for information and clarity, just to make sure that we understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10456)|
| 2:54:23| As you read this document, all elements were satisfied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10463)|
| 2:54:27| other than the fact that they went back and forth on, well, they never got the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10467)|
| 2:54:32| and the deed document turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| There were exchanges and attempts made in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10475)|
| 2:54:41| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10481)|
| 2:54:42| Hey, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10482)|
| 2:54:43| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10483)|
| 2:54:44| Let's say that we did take it back in as a library entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10484)|
| 2:54:48| What would the Board of Directors of BECC, they would have no BECC employees, I don't guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10488)|
| 2:54:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10497)|
| 2:54:58| So the Board of Directors would just talk about programs and artifacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10498)|
| 2:55:02| Because total control would have to, I mean, the artifacts are back, the history is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10502)|
| 2:55:07| If it wasn't, let's say we lost a court case, or if there is a court case, and the MOU says it's a library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10507)|
| 2:55:15| The Board's gone as far as decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| You lose all control when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| I do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10523)|
| 2:55:24| And, again, that should be words toward the Board of Directors of the BECC Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10524)|
| 2:55:30| I agree with what you're saying to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| But in my mind, it would operate similar to the East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10532)|
| 2:55:36| I think there's a private kind of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| Well, there's a historical center, and then there's a historical society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10542)|
| 2:55:43| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10543)|
| 2:55:44| And there's a library system element of documents and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10544)|
| 2:55:48| But they would lose total control of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| They would lose total control of the land and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| That is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| And that's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10557)|
| 2:55:58| You know, I've been involved in some of these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| I mean, there's one going on right now here in town with a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| But anyway, what sometimes is done, you take the board that governed the hospital previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10563)|
| 2:56:10| and really you keep the same members and they become an advisory committee or an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10570)|
| 2:56:16| And because of some of the uniqueness of BECC, I mean, you do lose control, I guess, in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10576)|
| 2:56:21| but you still have a lot of input on how the place is managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| And I would suggest that if indeed BECC at some point did become part of the library system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| or really the ownership was taken over by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| is we would retain the board as part of the advisory committee that would direct activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10593)|
| 2:56:41| and some of the things that BECC does because of its uniqueness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10601)|
| 2:56:44| And that's frequently what happens when, you know, an entity changes its relationship with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10604)|
| 2:56:50| May I comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10612)|
| 2:56:53| The devil is in the details, of course, and you don't have the benefit yet of having read the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10613)|
| 2:57:01| at least not very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| And I think when you see it, you'll see that the kinds of questions you're raising are addressed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10623)|
| 2:57:09| They may not be addressed in exactly the way you would like them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| and we had discussions ongoing with the Ragsdale administration on how to tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10632)|
| 2:57:19| They proposed some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| We proposed some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10641)|
| 2:57:22| Nothing ever got settled on that because after we proposed some changes, the next thing we got, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10642)|
| 2:57:30| I'm not sure of the sequence, but we got that letter of August 10 from Mayor Ragsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10650)|
| 2:57:36| which kind of took us by surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10656)|
| 2:57:40| But, yeah, I would thank you all for your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| and help you guys really earn your salaries, believe me, and the travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10663)|
| 2:57:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| Albert Baugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10671)|
| 2:57:57| Sharon Ann Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10677)|
| 2:58:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10684)|
| 2:58:05| I'm sure you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10685)|
| 2:58:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10686)|
| 2:58:07| My name is Sharon Ann Murphy, spelled M-U-R-P-H-R-E-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10687)|
| 2:58:12| I live at 1074 Scenic Drive, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10692)|
| 2:58:17| And I wish to make it extremely clear that I am not here as a member of the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10697)|
| 2:58:23| or representing the Beck Center in any way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10703)|
| 2:58:27| I've never even attended a Beck Board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10707)|
| 2:58:30| I am, as of last week, a member of the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10710)|
| 2:58:36| What I'm here about today, and this is the second time, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10716)|
| 2:58:41| and I appreciate very much you all hearing me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| This is the third time, actually, I've appeared before you on behalf of the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10723)|
| 2:58:49| And I'm appearing before you as an individual citizen who knows the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10729)|
| 2:58:56| from several years as meeting there as co-chairman of the East Tennessee Civil Rights Working Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10736)|
| 2:59:03| and co-chairman along with Rick Lambert, who is special agent in charge of the FBI Eastern Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10743)|
| 2:59:09| Now, my familiarity with Beck as a center and a place to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10749)|
| 2:59:15| prompted my attendance the first time at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10755)|
| 2:59:20| Subsequently, based on media publicity and information that I found to be not just incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10760)|
| 2:59:29| but highly offensive in some cases on blogs and rumors and things that were incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10769)|
| 2:59:35| I've done some research, or I've asked the Beck Center to do some research also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10775)|
| 2:59:39| Last week, I spoke about the city budget, the county budget, the Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10779)|
| 2:59:44| Today, I'm bringing before you some information about how the Beck Center contributes to this community financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10784)|
| 2:59:54| and how it brings in a great deal of the Hotel Motel Tax Fund dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10794)|
| 2:59:59| Not as many as the football games, as I misspoke last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10799)|
| 3:00:05| But according to Mr. Rollins, some 60,000 to 80,000 people per year at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10805)|
| 3:00:12| And I have asked Mr. Rollins, who provided a staff member, to give me information on some of those events that arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10812)|
| 3:00:22| These are events that in many instances require many people to take, to spend time in the hotel, motel, in the community, to buy gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10822)|
| 3:00:33| And for example, this is not a complete list because I've been having people come up to me and speak to me saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10833)|
| 3:00:41| well, this is what we do on a monthly basis, or we had this event, and it wasn't on the list that I was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10841)|
| 3:00:48| For example, I have eight pages worth of lists of events that have occurred since 2009 through May of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10848)|
| 3:00:58| In 2009, there were 2,545 people that attended scheduled events such as receptions, weddings, anniversaries, alumni events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10858)|
| 3:01:10| graduation tours from out of the area that entitled or required people to spend time over one night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10870)|
| 3:01:18| One night at least in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| Many may have spent the time with friends or family, but a lot spent time in hotels and motels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10881)|
| 3:01:28| They ate from our restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| They bought gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10891)|
| 3:01:32| They spent money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| In 2010, there's a list of 2,364 people of the same type of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10894)|
| 3:01:41| In 2011, just through May, 2,967.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10901)|
| 3:01:47| Now, this is an incomplete list because Mrs. Gater here on the row back here with the green dress on gave me permission to speak to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10907)|
| 3:01:57| of the Gater family reunion in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| The Beck Center records that I was given said there were approximately 121 people at that gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10921)|
| 3:02:08| She said there were closer to 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10928)|
| 3:02:10| They came from 10 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10930)|
| 3:02:12| They were here from Friday through Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10932)|
| 3:02:16| They spent many, many dollars, many nights in the hotels, motels, restaurants purchasing gas and other events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10936)|
| 3:02:23| And she said there are other events such as one having to do with Austin East or Austin Reunion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10943)|
| 3:02:33| Also, on a monthly basis or at least quarterly basis, I have a list of nine organizations that attend regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10953)|
| 3:02:45| And that isn't complete because another lady spoke to me about the senior group that meets at Beck that wasn't on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10965)|
| 3:02:56| And she said they meet at Beck because the location is one that works for all of the members of this senior group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10976)|
| 3:03:04| And their motto is losing themselves in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10984)|
| 3:03:07| And they do a great deal of fundraising and contributing to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10987)|
| 3:03:12| And they meet at the Beck Center because if they were to meet at any one of the individual churches involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10992)|
| 3:03:19| there would be people who could not meet at that church because it would possibly bring up feelings of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10999)|
| 3:03:28| why are you meeting at this church instead of my church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| My point here is that if you cut the Beck Center funds as has been projected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11012)|
| 3:03:39| and I appreciate Commissioner McKenzie's motion saying that he is going to reintroduce that fund to the $150,000 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11019)|
| 3:03:52| But if you cut this, you're going to be cutting something that brings a great deal of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11032)|
| 3:03:58| a great deal of many things to this community in dollars and prestige and research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11038)|
| 3:04:05| And I can't even begin to list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11045)|
| 3:04:09| It would be short-sighted to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| And I would just compare, and I'm not trying to denigrate any other organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11052)|
| 3:04:18| Ms. Murphy, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11058)|
| 3:04:19| If I could ask you to wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11059)|
| 3:04:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11060)|
| 3:04:22| May I just say that I would ask you very seriously to reconsider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11062)|
| 3:04:29| and to go forward with information and facts and not with innuendo and allegations that are not proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11069)|
| 3:04:37| And I appreciate very much the opportunity to speak before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11077)|
| 3:04:41| And I do not envy you or your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| It's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11083)|
| 3:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11084)|
| 3:04:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11085)|
| 3:04:46| Next we have Elijah Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11086)|
| 3:04:52| Sir, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11092)|
| 3:04:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11093)|
| 3:04:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11094)|
| 3:04:55| If you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11095)|
| 3:04:56| My name is Elijah Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11096)|
| 3:04:57| My address is 1812 Sutters Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| And mine won't take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| It won't take but a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11102)|
| 3:05:04| I'm one of the executive directors for the NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| I come before you today on behalf of the board of the NAACP and our membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11108)|
| 3:05:14| Today I ask you respectfully to fund the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| You commissioners can stop the Beck from closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11118)|
| 3:05:22| a place of genuine community spirit that protects a culture and promotes racial harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11122)|
| 3:05:29| Please keep the Beck Cultural Exchange Center open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11129)|
| 3:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11134)|
| 3:05:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| We have one other person on public forum, and we're going to switch gears here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11137)|
| 3:05:40| But before we do so, I'd like to recognize the fact that today is Gloria Ray's birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11140)|
| 3:05:45| So happy birthday to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11145)|
| 3:05:49| Happy birthday to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| Happy birthday, Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| Happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11154)|
| 3:05:55| Happy birthday to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11158)|
| 3:05:59| She gave up her birthday dinner to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| I'm 64, and I don't really feel like I'm 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| I really just feel like I'm in the hood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11165)|
| 3:06:09| My shirt is just a bait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11169)|
| 3:06:16| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11176)|
| 3:06:22| Our final person on public forum, Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11182)|
| 3:06:24| Mr. Mays, if you'd come forward, give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11190)|
| 3:06:31| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11191)|
| 3:06:32| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11192)|
| 3:06:37| I apologize I couldn't be here earlier when you all discussed the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11197)|
| 3:06:41| I was sidetracked quite a bit of the day today in court trying to recover some of these funds for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11201)|
| 3:06:49| I just wanted to point one thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11209)|
| 3:06:53| The auditor made a great deal of recommendations on how we could catch problems in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11213)|
| 3:06:59| but something that I am aware of was that many of the problems that are covered in the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11219)|
| 3:07:07| there were people that it were aware of that did not say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11227)|
| 3:07:14| For instance, there's just a couple of things I'm going to mention, but before I get on to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11234)|
| 3:07:18| I want to change gears for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11238)|
| 3:07:22| I discovered something that's not in the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11242)|
| 3:07:25| It turns out that Natural Resources was being paid a fee to count how many tires Knox County recycles every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11245)|
| 3:07:34| I discovered that Natural Resources was being paid this fee before they won the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11254)|
| 3:07:42| We were paying them to count tires before they got the contract to count tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11262)|
| 3:07:47| And in my mind, and, you know, this is just, I don't know what kind of evidence you would call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11267)|
| 3:07:54| but in my mind, it's a red flag that indicates to me, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11274)|
| 3:07:58| that the contractor may have had some knowledge of these shenanigans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11278)|
| 3:08:02| That just didn't seem like it was appropriate under county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11282)|
| 3:08:06| Anyway, that was something that was not in the audit that I was aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11286)|
| 3:08:10| How can you pay someone for a contract before they won it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| and how does the contractor collect the money or know what to bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11292)|
| 3:08:17| Back to the other topic I was going to mention, for instance, the Halls Green Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11297)|
| 3:08:23| There was some detection of theft of the Halls Green Waste money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11303)|
| 3:08:28| Our Solid Waste Department was aware for months that envelopes full of cash money were being stolen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11308)|
| 3:08:34| from the Halls Green Waste program, but they didn't call the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11314)|
| 3:08:41| This is not the former Solid Waste Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| This is during the current administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| So us putting in safeguards to make sure we know when money is stolen will not do us any good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11327)|
| 3:08:54| when a department head does not call the police when they realize money has been stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11334)|
| 3:09:02| But that is something that we know and we can establish very plainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11342)|
| 3:09:09| and that's not something that you can pass off on past administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11349)|
| 3:09:14| And I think that it should be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11354)|
| 3:09:17| And in addition to that, the fact that there were county employees that were perfectly aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11357)|
| 3:09:22| that highly contaminated mulch was sold by this contractor to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11362)|
| 3:09:27| and didn't warn anybody and continued to tell commission everything was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| That is an issue that cannot be blamed on past administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| It happened during the current Solid Waste Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| And there are other issues as well, but these are undeniable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11378)|
| 3:09:42| We've got admissions on some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11382)|
| 3:09:45| We've got testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| And these are things that should also be addressed, such as knowing of theft that is not reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11387)|
| 3:09:52| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11392)|
| 3:09:56| I see a light, so I paused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11396)|
| 3:09:59| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11399)|
| 3:10:02| There are issues, Brad, that I take exception to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11402)|
| 3:10:10| And one of them is, and this, in my opinion, has been a problem in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11410)|
| 3:10:18| I don't think it's okay for citizens to come up here and accuse county employees of criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11418)|
| 3:10:26| If you think something criminal has occurred, then you need to take it to the sheriff's department or to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11426)|
| 3:10:35| It's not okay to come up here, and this is my feeling as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11435)|
| 3:10:42| who I feel like it's my responsibility is to stand up for our county employees, that that's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11442)|
| 3:10:51| If you feel like a crime has been committed, then please, please take it to the sheriff's department, take it to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11451)|
| 3:10:59| But don't come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| What specifically are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| What allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11464)|
| 3:11:06| Well, you just said that an employee, and you're, of course, assuming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11466)|
| 3:11:12| or I'm not assuming I know exactly who you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11472)|
| 3:11:14| We all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11474)|
| 3:11:16| You're talking about Tom Salter saying that he had knowledge of a crime being committed and didn't take it anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11476)|
| 3:11:23| I happen to know that there was a great deal of evidence gathering that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11483)|
| 3:11:32| and people were fired as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11492)|
| 3:11:36| I was aware of that when it was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11496)|
| 3:11:39| So I have a real problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11499)|
| 3:11:43| Now, I think that every citizen of the county has the right to come say what they would like to say about the county business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11503)|
| 3:11:55| but it's not okay to come up here and make allegations like that about a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11515)|
| 3:12:01| And that's just, I'm saying as a commissioner that I don't think that that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11521)|
| 3:12:10| And also, if you have a lawsuit, this doesn't help you to come and bring whatever to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11530)|
| 3:12:20| This needs to happen in a courtroom if this is part of your lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11540)|
| 3:12:25| And like I said before, the county has disengaged itself from this whole process for lack of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11545)|
| 3:12:34| So I'm just asking you, please, to respect the position that our employees are in and the jobs that they have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11554)|
| 3:12:42| and take a different tact on how this is handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11562)|
| 3:12:48| Because I don't think it helps anybody's credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11568)|
| 3:12:55| Commissioners, do we want to go forward with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11575)|
| 3:12:58| I'm not in great ways to have a different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11578)|
| 3:13:01| Yeah, I'm just, I mean, continuing with this, is this productive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11581)|
| 3:13:05| I mean, if the commissioners want to continue on, we'll continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11585)|
| 3:13:11| Yes, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11591)|
| 3:13:12| Brad, what was the year of that tire contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11592)|
| 3:13:14| What year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11594)|
| 3:13:15| 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11595)|
| 3:13:18| And I would point out the thefts of the hall's green waste envelopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11598)|
| 3:13:25| We can establish where the ones that I know about were in 2008 and 2009 that envelopes were stolen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11605)|
| 3:13:34| and they were not reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11614)|
| 3:13:36| And there is a statute that states that any time a public employee is aware that any public funds have been taken whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11616)|
| 3:13:44| that you only have five business days to report it to the state comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11624)|
| 3:13:49| And that did not take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| Then you need to report that to the sheriff's department or to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11631)|
| 3:13:55| You do not need to bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11635)|
| 3:13:56| Ladies and gentlemen, this is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11636)|
| 3:13:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11638)|
| 3:13:59| Thank you, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11639)|
| 3:14:00| Mr. Wright, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| This is a different subject we're through with green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11642)|
| 3:14:08| The amendments that are before us, could I have a recap of those so I can know what to think about between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11648)|
| 3:14:14| and smile, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11654)|
| 3:14:18| This is what I, you're talking about the amendments to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| Here's what I have thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11660)|
| 3:14:21| We're talking about the commission's discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11661)|
| 3:14:24| And that amendment is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| Thirty-three thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11666)|
| 3:14:27| That's what I'm going to be proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| That it stay at three thousand per person and we're going to do something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11669)|
| 3:14:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11673)|
| 3:14:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11674)|
| 3:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11675)|
| 3:14:36| The Great Schools Partnership, Commissioner Anders said that he would like to have a discussion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| That's 2.6 million in their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11680)|
| 3:14:42| And to do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11682)|
| 3:14:43| I didn't catch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| To take it, to do away with it or to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11685)|
| 3:14:48| Oh, here's Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| Sorry, I was talking to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11690)|
| 3:14:52| That's a 2.6 million dollar savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| Two percent raise is like 2.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11694)|
| 3:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11696)|
| 3:14:57| That's what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11697)|
| 3:14:58| I was trying to make a connection between what that was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11698)|
| 3:15:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11701)|
| 3:15:02| That would do the 2.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| The travel pay for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| And what was the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| The amount on that, I believe, is about 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11709)|
| 3:15:12| Twenty-five, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11712)|
| 3:15:14| Is that right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11714)|
| 3:15:15| Twenty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| Twenty-five above what's in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11717)|
| 3:15:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11719)|
| 3:15:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11720)|
| 3:15:21| Yeah, there is an amount in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11721)|
| 3:15:22| This would be 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11722)|
| 3:15:23| And we're going to do it by the mile or we're going to do it as a part of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11723)|
| 3:15:27| That would put it back at 300 per month, but we can put it wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11727)|
| 3:15:31| I kind of like Brad's thought about it, but I don't think it was, I don't think we prescribed that per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11731)|
| 3:15:38| Okay, it's dollars and we don't know what we're going to call the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11738)|
| 3:15:41| That's, okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| Again, the restoration of the BEC funds would be 138,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11744)|
| 3:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11748)|
| 3:15:49| The CAT buses for the senior citizens would be 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11749)|
| 3:15:55| And that's something that had been free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| Free for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11758)|
| 3:16:00| Yeah, we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11760)|
| 3:16:01| We had always paid 75,000 a year so that our senior citizens could ride CAT for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11761)|
| 3:16:07| And the county had kicked in the 75,000 every year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11767)|
| 3:16:11| And what's happening is bus rides right now are $1.50 and they'd have to go to 75 cents for seniors, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11771)|
| 3:16:19| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11779)|
| 3:16:20| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11780)|
| 3:16:21| So really what we're talking about is seniors, instead of riding for free, today they can ride for 75 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11781)|
| 3:16:30| Well, I think what we're talking about is, I mean, for our purposes it's $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11790)|
| 3:16:34| Right, but I'm talking about where the money's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11797)|
| 3:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11798)|
| 3:16:39| Then we talked about possible salary increases for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| Of course, that, you know, depends on what the proposal would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11802)|
| 3:16:46| And there again, what is the proposal here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11806)|
| 3:16:49| What's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| Brad, come again and talk to me about salary increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11811)|
| 3:16:59| Are you looking at a one-time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| Yeah, mine was not a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11821)|
| 3:17:03| There's two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11823)|
| 3:17:04| You can increase the step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11824)|
| 3:17:05| Everybody move up a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| And it can, and I think John, I was going to ask John to get a number on that, but mine was just a 2%, just a salary increase of 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11827)|
| 3:17:17| How much is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11837)|
| 3:17:18| 2.4, I think, is what I've gotten from the finance department, which is the 2.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11838)|
| 3:17:25| I need to weigh in on that for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| If we're saying a 2% raise or a 1% raise or a 3% raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11850)|
| 3:17:35| and we're tying that to the fact that we need to help those that need the most help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11855)|
| 3:17:44| I don't know that a 3% raise on a person that's making $75,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11864)|
| 3:17:50| really carries the weight of a 3% raise on a person that's making $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11870)|
| 3:17:58| You can cap it at a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11878)|
| 3:18:00| I don't mind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11880)|
| 3:18:01| I mean, you say $60,000 and below, you cap it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| And the actual exact opposite of a percentage raise is to say how many employees there are that are not covered by raises this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11883)|
| 3:18:13| I mean, this wouldn't apply to school teachers or other people that are getting raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11893)|
| 3:18:18| And I'll make simple math now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11898)|
| 3:18:22| If there were 1,000 employees and we had $1 million, you divide $1 million by 1,000, and that's the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11902)|
| 3:18:30| That's across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11910)|
| 3:18:31| That's not a percentage raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11911)|
| 3:18:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11912)|
| 3:18:33| I said that's the other end of the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11913)|
| 3:18:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11914)|
| 3:18:35| And I'm going to get the information from Francis tomorrow about the difference between a step increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11915)|
| 3:18:41| and a percentage increase because there's a difference in how they're handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11921)|
| 3:18:44| and the effect that they have across the workforce in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11924)|
| 3:18:49| So I'll have that information, and I'll get it out hopefully by the end of business tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11929)|
| 3:18:54| so that you can have that to compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11936)|
| 3:18:57| But you do grasp that if we're talking $1 million or $3 million, I'm not talking about the amount of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11937)|
| 3:19:05| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11945)|
| 3:19:08| Dividing it across the board will be something that I'll come closer to supporting than a percentage raise for the very fact –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11948)|
| 3:19:17| So what you're talking about is a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11959)|
| 3:19:20| One time in August when people are going back to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11960)|
| 3:19:26| when those that have kids that are in the entry-level to medium-level job brackets –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11966)|
| 3:19:34| I think it's fair to look at all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11976)|
| 3:19:37| Continuing on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| The other was the IMES Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11979)|
| 3:19:42| I think restoring the funding for that and also Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11982)|
| 3:19:45| Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11985)|
| 3:19:46| I thought we had already had discussion about Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11986)|
| 3:19:49| and it was going to be moved somewhere and their $50,000 were going to be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11989)|
| 3:19:54| That was Doug Battelle who addressed us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11994)|
| 3:19:57| I don't remember exactly what he said, but we can find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=11997)|
| 3:20:01| Mr. Troyer, can you weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12001)|
| 3:20:05| Because Doug Battelle had spoken with us about Legacy Parks, and I don't remember what he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12005)|
| 3:20:09| but it was something about the fact they were going to look to see if maybe that funding could be restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12009)|
| 3:20:13| That was alluded to in the budget workshop of last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12013)|
| 3:20:17| and that is not a part of the mayor's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12017)|
| 3:20:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12022)|
| 3:20:23| See, if it's not something they're picking up on, then it needs to be on our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12023)|
| 3:20:29| Continuing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12029)|
| 3:20:30| And the other one I had was, I believe, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12030)|
| 3:20:32| You were talking about Outlets Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| The funding for that, the $2.8 million of maybe looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12034)|
| 3:20:37| and seeing if we needed to even fund that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12037)|
| 3:20:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12039)|
| 3:20:40| That's what I have, unless there was something else that I missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12040)|
| 3:20:43| Just as a detail, you know, on my list, I actually had, you proposed three, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12043)|
| 3:20:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12050)|
| 3:20:51| So the discretionary funds is up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12051)|
| 3:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12054)|
| 3:20:55| So other things, most people with budget amendments are looking to try to get them in by Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12055)|
| 3:21:03| but if not by Thursday, you may be able to do it Tuesday morning on the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12063)|
| 3:21:10| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12070)|
| 3:21:11| You can submit right up until we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| It's just that I might need some more time to think about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12075)|
| 3:21:20| and develop within me some support for some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12080)|
| 3:21:25| because I go back to what I said last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12085)|
| 3:21:31| We haven't today, since 5 o'clock, we have not increased the first dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12091)|
| 3:21:38| We're only talking about where dollars are going to be reallocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12098)|
| 3:21:42| I believe that it came from the campaign when, as Commissioner Smith alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12102)|
| 3:21:48| maybe we should have all run for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12108)|
| 3:21:51| I'm glad I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| The Hope Resource Center was also mentioned about cutting funding for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12114)|
| 3:21:57| or reducing funding and also those that were scheduled for layoffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| seeing if there was a way to keep those individuals employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12121)|
| 3:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12124)|
| 3:22:05| And one thing, that brings up a note that I did not look down at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| There was comment made that in last year's budget out of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12129)|
| 3:22:13| 17 people were going to be laid off, 31 people were going to be laid off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12133)|
| 3:22:18| and then it got down to 17, and they found the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12138)|
| 3:22:23| No, they did not fund the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12143)|
| 3:22:25| The money was sent from Nashville, and there were still people laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12145)|
| 3:22:30| They had layoffs out of the school system last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12150)|
| 3:22:36| I know of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12156)|
| 3:22:38| There could have been more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12158)|
| 3:22:40| So to say that they found the money in their budget, they didn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12160)|
| 3:22:45| Nashville sent them more money, and they still laid people off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12165)|
| 3:22:48| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12168)|
| 3:22:49| And in all of that, I find that the budget has been fairly well presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12169)|
| 3:22:58| and there will have to be strong cases for me to support any amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12178)|
| 3:23:03| any individual amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12183)|
| 3:23:04| If the mayor brings amendments to his budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12184)|
| 3:23:07| and presents them as his budget amended, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12187)|
| 3:23:13| But for us to sit as commission and pick and choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12193)|
| 3:23:17| it will have to be a strong case for me to vote in favor of an amended budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12197)|
| 3:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12207)|
| 3:23:28| A reminder, commissioners, we meet Thursday at 5 in the small assembly room with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12208)|
| 3:23:32| It will be a joint meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12212)|
| 3:23:33| Commissioner Smith, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| What does that total up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| Do you know yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12217)|
| 3:23:38| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12218)|
| 3:23:39| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12219)|
| 3:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=12227)|
