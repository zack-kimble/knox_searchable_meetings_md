| 0:01:14| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=74)|

| 0:01:17| Would everyone please rise for the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=77)|

| 0:01:25| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=85)|
| 0:01:39| Okay, before we begin to formalize tonight's agenda and see, I don't believe, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| to look to Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Drusilla, do we have anyone who signed up for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| I know every meeting we have, there's always some folks who this might be your first and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| or only time you get to make it to a county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| We also have folks, I know, who may be watching this meeting from home and I always like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| take just a minute for their benefit to explain a little bit about how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| We always, unless there's a holiday, we usually meet the third and fourth Monday of each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| This meeting is actually considered a work session and the meeting next Monday is considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| the official meeting of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| So the purpose of tonight's meeting is we're going to go work our way through a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| the items that are on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| Some are going to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| We also have many items that, as a matter of business, this commission has to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| Often those are non-controversial, sometimes very simple things that we as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| have to put the eyes on and cross the T's and dot the I's in order to make them happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| Those types of issues are put on our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| So the next item I'll move to will be where we set our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| Some of the commissioners may want to discuss some items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Some things may pass and get put onto the consent agenda and some things may be pushed forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| to actually vote on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| So a little bit about how the process will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| Drisilla has indicated that no one has signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| However, I do want to ask the audience if there is anyone here today that would like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| the county commission as a matter of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| Is there anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Seeing none, I'm going to move on to setting tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| So my fellow commissioners, I did post several things in our forum prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=215)|
| 0:03:42| I'm going to review those items that we determined, that at least this chair I determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| and then I'll ask if there's any changes or additional items that each of you all would like to pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| We are going to defer item 59 to a future meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| We are going to formally add item 47, 55, 56, and 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=241)|
| 0:04:18| The non-consent agenda will be items 6, 7, 16, 23, 25, 35, 37, 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=258)|
| 0:04:43| 42, 43, 46, 47, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, and 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=283)|
| 0:05:10| Do I need to go over that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Commissioner Smith, I believe you may have a couple of other additional items that you'd like to pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Item number 26 and item 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| Madam Clerk, would you please add those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| Are there any other additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| Then, Commissioner Jay, I know our gentleman here at the Lakes, we're going to keep him on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Did you also do number 38?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| Because you put that on the commission form that you wanted 37 and 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Did that not make it to my short list here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| Actually, it wasn't on my little red sheet, so that's item 38 and 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| I had 37 but not item 38 on my cheat sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Yes, Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| I didn't hear you say 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| That shouldn't be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Add 49 to the non-consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Did I hear you say 59 was non-consent, but I thought we deferred it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| That was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| So, yeah, that's going to be, well, it's going to have to read it, but it's going to be deferred to next, possibly October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=395)|
| 0:06:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Are there any other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Commissioner Carringer, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=409)|

| 0:08:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Before we move on this, I'd like to encourage some discussion on this particular board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| I had mentioned on our commissioner's forum that we had had one person expressing an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| on this particular body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| But we, in fairness to the process, we also have to open it up to see if any other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| have any other folks that you'd like to nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| So, I'd like to get a little advice from this body on how you all would like to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| Is there, like, can I post it for open and see if any other folks express interest this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| week and then we can consider it Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Seeing all heads nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| What we will do on this particular item, I'd like the motion to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| Drusilla, if you could make sure we send out a little bit about this to all the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| to see if any commissioners also have folks who may have an interest in this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| And Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| What have we done for this appointment as far as advertising and letting people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| that there is an available seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| I don't know that we've done a big PR campaign on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Unless the Air Department, is that the right word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Unless the Air Board has done an internal promotion or anything like that, I'm not aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| that we've done a big promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| Although, we could have Drusilla send out a press release on it on this opening to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| if there's any other interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| I received an additional resume of someone in the community interested in serving on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| that position and I'll forward the information to Drusilla so it can get out to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| And I think, you know, what I'm thinking is, Drusilla, if you could send out a traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| media release like we usually do on this one that the county commission will be making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| this appointment, that strikes me as the fairest way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| So, I guess now, what I'd like to do is have a motion to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| Is there anyone who would like to make that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| That was moved by Commissioner Beeler and seconded by Commissioner Carringer, or at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| least I heard you whispering in my ear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| On page three, item number 16 is a resolution assenting to a community request to rename| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| a portion of Stonewall Street adjacent to Sammy Hill School for community member, leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| and supporter, Gloria Garner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| This is resolution 208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| I pulled this one from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| It's one that we would obviously approve, but I wanted to create an opportunity to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| and thank her for her service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| Schools, does anyone know her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Is it going to be possible to get her to the meeting next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Russ or Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Yes, I know her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Do we need to send an email or just simply contact her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| I don't have her contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| If you do, Commissioner Gill, if you could take care of that, and if she can't make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| next week, if she's got a conflict, we'll move it to the next month to find a time where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| she will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Yes, Russ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| I just wanted to make sure that there was a complete understanding of where we are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| the process on this, and Mr. Green can correct me if I get this wrong, but as I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| the process with Knox Planning is when there is an interest in the community to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| and do a renaming of a street or a facility, their process requires the individuals who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| are interested in doing that to contact all the adjacent property owners to gain their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| assent for that action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| And then once they do that, it goes back to the MPC for their review and action and proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| back to the appropriate body for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| So where we are in this, I was contacted by a city councilman who said we want to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| So that's what the board has done as the owner or owner's representative for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=750)|
| 0:12:38| at Sammy Hill, and then it has progressed over here to county commission, because commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| name is really what's on the deed for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| I guess I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| So should the next step be, so this has not gone through the MPC process on contacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| adjacent property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| This is not approving any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| This is just assenting to the action so that it can go through the rest of the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| We're just, I guess finalize, we're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Is that correct, Mr. Wall Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| I want to, if you, Bud, if you could weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| So is the prop, all right, I'm going to recognize, I think Commissioner Anders, your light was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| on a little earlier than I'll recognize Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| Are we renaming the street or are we doing the same thing we did to honor Coach Rosser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| at Central?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Because if we're renaming the street, it's not just, and I'm for it, but to rename a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| block for law enforcement or emergency services and 9-1-1 and all that other stuff, it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| funding issue too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| It can cost money to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| But are we naming that section in honor of her or are we trying to change the whole street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| name from Stonewall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| The request was to name a portion, so it may be just a section that is more of an honorary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| recognition because I believe it came to us as a portion of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| It's a portion of the street and I think the exact piece is in the details of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| I don't have that, but it does leave a section of Stonewall Street as Stonewall Street, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| the lion's share of it would become named for Ms. Garner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| Is it splitting Stonewall Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Is it going to be Stonewall, Ms. Garner, Stonewall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Not my understanding, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| The way I read it is that there would be a couple of blocks of Stonewall left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| You know, Stonewall is basically split by an industrial development, so it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| part of it on the other side of the industrial development from where the schools are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| And what could be helpful, because that's Lonsdale is the area I represent, is to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| pull the community meeting, answer all the questions, and identify specifically what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| they want to do, and then just bring it back with a particular recommendation so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| have the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| So I guess my question is, should we go ahead and just pass this to get this process started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| and then maybe we don't bring her in for the recognition because it's just we're not there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| yet is what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| So I guess what we should do is just leave this on consent, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| Go ahead, Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I think we're on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| What happened just doing this for Coach Rosser, we named it, we had it as an honorary street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| name, which was put under the main street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| The streets stayed the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| So that process was to go before city council, which I believe Lauren Ryder is the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| She presents that to her committee, and then they approve it or disapprove it, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| it comes back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| So really, this is probably something that we should probably defer for 30 days is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=948)|
| 0:15:57| my recommendation would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Did you read in the packet the information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| Have they already okayed everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| This is just a procedural thing for the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| They need us to basically bless this so this ball can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| I just, frankly, I pulled it mainly because we had a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| But I think it's just an honorary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| It'll be just an honorary to answer maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| No, it says it's changing the name of the street for a portion of Stonewall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| So let's do this in order to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| We are the interim decision maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| So the chair will entertain a motion to pass this resolution or to place it on the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| agenda to vote next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Then this will probably come back to us, or we'll be invited to a ribbon-cutting for when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| the name is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| It's in Commissioner Gill's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| You'll make sure we all are aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| So move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| So we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| And a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Is there any additional discussion on this one, Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Your light is still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Your light is still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| All opposed, please say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| On page 4, item number 23, it's a resolution approving a construction agreement in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| amount of $884,657, the CSX Transportation Inc., for the construction of two new bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1037)|
| 0:17:26| over CSXT Railroad as part of the Shod Road Extension Project, Resolution 406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| We have a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| Jim, I pulled this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| We all know Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| This is one of our biggest projects we're working on in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| And we've also, it's gotten a lot of press, too, and it's definitely an improvement we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| We're also putting a lot of money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| So, I thought this was a good stop point for you to kind of provide an update to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| I also know Commissioner Schoonmaker has got a question on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| So, out of respect for Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'll call on him first and then you all go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| So, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Did you want to give us the quick briefing and maybe my question will be answered or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Sure, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| It's whichever you prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| And I had handed out a little summary sheet for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| Hopefully, everybody did receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| This kind of speaks to the project in totality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| It is essentially a northwest connector that runs 13 miles from I-40 at Lovell Road to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1104)|
| 0:18:33| I-75 at Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Portions of that, about four miles, are state route 131 or Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| And the remaining nine miles of that, which are Shod Road, Ball Camp, and Ball Road, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| county routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| To date, we have acquired 363 tracks of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Forty of those plus are relocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| So, we've moved 40 residents and businesses from their locations to accommodate for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| And you can see there the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| It's the largest project that the engineering department has ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| Once it's totally complete, it's estimated somewhere around $57.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| To date, we've spent $22.5 million, but those dollars are essentially 2000-era dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| So, the phase that we're currently working on and going to bid this year is phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| and three, which will be from Middlebrook Pike at Ball Camp Elementary School and adjoin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| the road that currently terminates at Glen Lake Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| That road will have two bridges that create grade-separated crossings at the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| And that's what item 23 is specifically in regard to, allowing us CSX permission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| inspection services for the construction of those bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| So, that roadway will never have at-grade crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| You won't have to wait on the train ever again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| So, there'll be two large bridges as part of that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| And that drives the cost of that road up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| That road will ultimately be around $24 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| The next phase, which is kind of near the golf course, what we call phase four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| it is in right-of-way currently, which is actually the next item we'll discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| And that project will probably get kicked off for construction late next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| at an estimated cost of about $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| And then on the back of that page, I've also gave you all the timeline that kind of shows you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| I guess, the process of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Pardon me, progress of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| You'll note it started in the late 90s and is still going on today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| and throughout that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| I've noted Callahan, Shawd, and the TDOT sections of level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| So, you'll have that for your information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| Okay, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| On the $885,000, how much is actually going to CSX for them to provide their people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1258)|
| 0:21:07| to observe this project going on over their railroad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| The bulk of it is, Commissioner, the flagging services total $535,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| So, over half of it is for their flagging services while we construct the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| And this is going to the CSX employees or whoever they contract with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| This is going directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Okay, so it's a half a million dollars for flagging services while you do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| And how many days do you anticipate, realistically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| And this doesn't even cover cost of the structure at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| This is direct payment to CSX Railroad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| And this is an estimate, so we'll closely monitor the hours that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| So, it may come in less than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| This is just what they anticipate the total could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Okay, is there any other questions or discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| Yes, Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| I'd like the definition of a flagger, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| A flagger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Yeah, for the services they're going to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| I'd like that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Are we talking about traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Are we talking about rail activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| You may want to clarify the way the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Yeah, anytime you work in their right-of-way, they have to have a competent person there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| Obviously, some of it is not that critical, like when you're building piers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| That's outside the rail line itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| However, we still will have to stop work when the train comes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| and that's what the flagger is there for, is to alert us to that train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| And in addition to, obviously, we're going to be setting beams on top of their structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| and in pouring decks, so there's a lot of safety and security that they want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| that we do those things appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Is there any other questions related to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Okay, I believe this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Okay, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| All right, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Item number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| This is a resolution approving a proposal from Vaughn & Milton Consulting Engineers, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| in the amount of, for right-of-way acquisition services for the Chaud Road Extension Project, Phase 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| from Oak Ridge Highway to Pleasant Ridge Road, Resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| We have a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders, with a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| I believe this one was pulled in conjunction with that one, and we now, when I pulled it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| we didn't have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| If you could clarify that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Yes, Chairman, and we actually still don't have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Matt Myers in procurement and I are actually meeting tomorrow to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| We're in active negotiations with the vendor, and we will have that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and the decision made by the time this body meets next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Make a motion to send without recommendation, instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Commissioner Anders, maker of the original motion, has changed his motion to send forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| and is that okay with the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| So the second concurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| So the motion on the floor is to send forward to next week's voting meeting with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| Is there any additional discussion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| I thought I saw a light over here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| No, that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Item number 26 is approving a contract with West Rock Converting LLC to provide recycled material recovery services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| Resolution 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Is there a motion related to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| I'd like to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Commissioner Anders votes to send forward with no recommendation with the second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Is there a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| We seem to get these recycling contracts quite often, and I know with the current state of the market and recyclables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1516)|
| 0:25:26| I'm just wondering, you know, you've listed on here the deposits that were made from before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| What kind of decline in revenue can we expect given the current market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| This is Drew Thurman, 205 West Baxter Avenue, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| I was prepared to answer a bunch of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| That's a more difficult one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| I would say that recycling is tied to global commodity markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| And, you know, if you look, so there was an executive summary, and it kind of listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| So, you know, PSC Metals is one of the people we deliver material to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| The steel market goes up and down, and depending on how much steel is worth, we get paid more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| And it really is kind of odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| So we're actually getting more steel than we've ever gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| And part of that is because the steel that you or I could take to PSC Metals as an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| you're not getting much money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| So they're treating it more as waste, which is good and bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| It means we're loading a lot of scrap metal at convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| And so we're actually getting more scrap metal value just because the sheer volume of metal is coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| So sometimes a negative commodity market can mean that we receive more value, more revenue for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1599)|
| 0:26:51| just because there's less intrinsic value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| With this contract, most of the items are tied to something that's like an intrinsic value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| So if you look like an aluminum can or steel cans, those are going to fluctuate and go up with a market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| The paper and cardboard, there are like official paper markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| And what the contractor has agreed to do is give us, say, a certain amount of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| a deduction below what that particular type of paper is trading at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| So if paper mills right now are buying cardboard for $100, they may give us $45 less than the $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1648)|
| 0:27:39| And so we actually can rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| It's not going to break our contract every time some commodity goes up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| Our contract has been designed to allow it to fluctuate with the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| So that being said, the budget projection I formulated last year in February, I think we put in around $350,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1672)|
| 0:28:00| $400,000 in revenue that we expect to produce from convenience centers for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| We had that same target last year, and we went at like $540,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| So we're doing pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| We're generating more revenue than we thought we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| The southeast is a pretty robust recycling market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| Dalton George is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| They're buying plastics to make carpet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| We've got Kimberly Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| We've got Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| PSE Metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| There are things that are getting recycled at convenience centers right now that are getting turned into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| for the manufacturing industry, and that's great for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| That's great for our local economy, and we're really lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| And I don't know where the national trends will take us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| but I'm fairly optimistic that we'll be at least protected by the fact that we have industry in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| I think, and Drew, you tell me if I read this right in this contract, that we will never lose money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| No matter what we take in, they will always at least haul it off, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| For this contract, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| So there's always going to be a cost avoidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| If I take material across the scale, we're not paying to bury it in a hole forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| We may get zero check, but we're still not paying that $23 a ton to bury it in a hole forever, and that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1752)|
| 0:29:21| Do our other contracts have that bottom floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Is there any possibility if the commodities market falls completely out that we will be charged to haul this off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| not just a zero-sum game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Not all of them, and I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| In the executive summary, the Spectra, like used oil, it goes up and down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| and we do pay when it goes below a certain, right around, I think the target is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| if you look at West Texas Intermediate for a barrel of oil, when it goes below $60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| we start having to pay for all the used oil that people bring in to convenience centers where they change their oil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| When it goes above $60, we start getting checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| Last year, whole months we were paying $1,200, $1,500, and whole months we were receiving checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| and it netted to be about $6,000 in checks to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| Now, we may have also spent $3,000 to pay, but I would say not every relationship is where we have a floor of zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| and that's one thing where we've had a pretty good partnership with the contractor, Westrock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| They've kept a floor of zero because they realize that regardless of how much it's worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| people are bringing it to a convenience center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| and if it's worth zero tomorrow, people are bringing it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| We've got to take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| So I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Second question is, I know that we are no longer taking glass and recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| I know that the city, I think it was a year or two ago, quit doing curbside pickup on glass recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| because of broke glass and the sort factor, sorting it back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| But the city has been able to maintain a recycling contract for glass pickup at their recycle locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Is that not with the same company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| It is the same company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| There's a little bit of a sequencing issue where the city, for all, I don't want to comment too much on what their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| but they went out with a similar bid like this a few months earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| and they do have, I believe, another year to accept glass with this contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| Actually, we've been in talks with the city because right now we're going to direct people, starting next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| directing people, which you might get calls or complaints about, if they want to recycle their glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| they're going to need to drive it to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| We're a little bit concerned that that relationship, even for the city, is going to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| They've already signed their contract with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| It's been approved by their council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| Ours, you know, I think this is a way that the glass recycling is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| is that it's probably going to go away in our area unless the city and county think of something like an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| And we've been in some discussion about road bedding, you know, turning it into an aggregate or sand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| and that's some conversations we're still having with the city, the county, UT, surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| But, yeah, my understanding is this will also, could potentially also affect the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| I don't want to comment on their thing, but they have it for another year at least as far as that's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| We have a couple other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Yeah, Drew, going back to the glass, I mean, I think it's, I still have curbside with a company that does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1961)|
| 0:32:49| I mean, I pay for trash service and it comes with recycling and it has glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| Why, what other options have you looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| I mean, I appreciate the work that this contract is going to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| I was just at our convenience store in Carnes this weekend, and people are in there in droves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| And what concerns me is we're going to find this on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| It's not, we're either going to bury it or it's going to be laying somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| And so what other options have we looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| And why can't we piggyback off the city's contract for a year until we find an alternative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| This is kind of a sudden change that I'm not very comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| It's definitely not, if you had asked me a month ago what would be my ideal situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| it wouldn't be the planning of removing the glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| Why are we so close to the end of the contract before we find this out and we have no other alternative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| It's not something that we've been doing for 10, 15, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| People are used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Yeah, I would say perhaps longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| It's something that we knew that it was going to be an issue, but we anticipated a phase-out period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2033)|
| 0:34:01| And the contractor came back and said this is something that we need to make more immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| And that was their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| How long is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I'm reading this executive summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| How long is this West Rock contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| So the contract, it's like an initial award for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| and then upon mutual consent year to year for a total of 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| But I would say in every agreement that we've made, contractual or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| there's always an add or delete services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| There's always the ability to procure from another provider if someone's unable to provide service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| Was this the only option on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| It was the only bid that we got back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| It was the only bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| It was the only bid the previous time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| So we have one company in town, and I don't want to disparage any company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| I'm glad you didn't name the company that picks up your trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| They might have not told you that the glass that you're putting in your curbside container is going to the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| So they're sorting it and throwing it in the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| I'm saying there's one game in town for mixed recycling, and it's this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| To my knowledge, I believe they notified the providers that they don't want glass in their stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| I hope that we can do better because it's going to wind up on the side of the road or buried forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| and I think that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| This is 2019, and we're Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| We should be ahead of that game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Actually, to speak on the side of the road, this is my just hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| is the folks who have taken the time to sort out glass and collect it for recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| are not the people that are going to dump it on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| I would really hope that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| I agree with that, but the litter's going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Glass model litter's going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| And I can tell you what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| I really am optimistic about glass as an aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| You see it all the time that there's these shortages of sand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| and that it can be turned back into road bedding and turned back into sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| We're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| UT's got some money to study that with the Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| It's just not going to be something that I can deliver glass to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| So we're taking the glass containers away, but we can put them right back if we find an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| So I don't know how long that service will disappear if we can't find an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| where we'd get people back in the habit of separating it and bringing it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Have we started notifying the citizens that use our collection facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| We have flyers that are out in every convenience center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| and we have some barricades that are going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| We just got them printed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| We've issued press releases, media releases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| There's been some stories in, I think, the Compass, WBR, WATE, Knox News.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2210)|
| 0:36:59| So we've been trying really hard to get the message out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| We've put it in our Facebook posts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| We've educated our operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| But I still think there'll be someone six months from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| someone who's been diligently sorting their glass is going to show up to a convenience center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| and they're going to see a barricade that says glass is not accepted here as recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| and they're probably going to be upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| I'm going to be on the other end of that phone listening and empathizing with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| because it's not something we chose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| And is the stop date the August 26th or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| That's when we're going to start removing the containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| It could be Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| It could be Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| We have to prepare to empty them and remove them from convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| Thank you. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| What is the surrounding counties looking at when they deal with their – you alluded to it earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| and it's just hard to believe in 2019 we're dealing with a single contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| with an immediate stop dealing with glass, which really has such a high –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| I mean, I don't understand the value associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Well, so I've been thinking about intrinsic value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| So, you know, if we had a gold wedding ring, we don't throw that in the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| It's got some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| There's someone who will weigh that and pay you for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| And that's all the way precious metals works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| And then you have stuff like cardboard or plastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| If you have large quantities of it, it has some value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| But glass is really – there's not a whole lot of folks out there beating our doors down trying to buy glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| And actually, most of the counties in Tennessee, they've been struggling to find a place to get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| And when I said I was reaching out to other counties, I was not aware that this had affected Anderson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| because we thought that actually all the other counties had already dropped glass recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| We thought it was – you know, glass recycling is one of the first things that went in 08, 09, during that collapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| A lot of folks stopped glass recycling because of that lack of intrinsic value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| It doesn't – it just doesn't have the same value as, like, an aluminum can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| People don't go through garbage and pull it out because of its weight value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| You know, maybe some places have container deposits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| It has some value there, but that's an arbitrary assignment of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| It's not actually that worth that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| All right. Commissioner Gill, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Okay. Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Okay. This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| It appears the chair recognizes one nay from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Okay. Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| On page 5, item number 32 is a resolution approving a contract with Charles Flaylock & Sons, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| in the amount of $793,473.10 for the construction of the Knox Blount Greenway from Alcoa Highway near Maloney Road to General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2409)|
| 0:40:19| This is resolution 701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| Okay. Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Okay. We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Smith with a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| Okay. Discussion, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| Yeah. Is Parks and Recreation going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2434)|
| 0:40:44| Okay. Go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| I'm Shawna Godlewski, 2447 Sutherland Avenue, and Kristen Grove from PPA is here to answer any questions, and I'm here to support her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2445)|
| 0:40:55| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Okay. Just jumping in real quick. Go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Okay. Is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to talk to Parks prior to this meeting, but is this a Parks and Recreation project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| And if you could kind of give me some details, because is this something we're doing through Engineering and Public Works because it's part of a greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2469)|
| 0:41:18| Or, Mr. Donala, do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| It was originally a Parks and Rec project, and the previous administration removed it due to the prior leadership and turned it over to PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2483)|
| 0:41:34| So PBA is overseeing it, and we're working in conjunction with them, but they are the project managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| They've asked us to be the main sponsor since it did fall under our purview at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| Okay, but if it was under a previous administration and it's just coming to us now, and we're already a year into a new administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| how come we wouldn't have our Parks and Recreation Department do it in conjunction with our Engineering and Public Works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2515)|
| 0:42:12| I mean, it was given over in the past administration, and the work started at that point, and now we're at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| It's just a matter of timing more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| But typically, isn't this something that can be handled by Parks and Recreation and Engineering and Public Works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2542)|
| 0:42:31| I mean, we're used to doing sidewalks, and we've done greenways as parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| No, we don't have the ability to do all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| And it's also under a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| There are parts of it that we have to outsource, so typically we work through PBA on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| This isn't anything new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| Okay, but so this didn't go out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| This just automatically rolled to PBA, to administrator of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| Yeah, I mean, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| I mean, this is nothing unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| And just to clarify, we are only doing project management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| We are not building this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| We're simply the project manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| I understand that, but you're not doing it for free, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| Well, technically, we do not have a price for our services to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| My department is already funded by the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| This greenway will extend from Maloney Road Park at Ginn Road down to just in front of the UT Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2624)|
| 0:43:53| That's probably, what, three-quarters of a mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| It's .6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| .6 miles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Tell me how the funding for this has come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| So in 2007, TDOT issued a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| It is an 80-20 match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| The original grant was about $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| Obviously, 2007 was a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| In 2013, they had problems with acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| and TDOT pulled about $380,000 out of the grant to self-perform part of the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| I sent a map up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| There are four phases of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| What we are currently working on is the green phase that you'll see on the map, little green phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| And so currently that is about $1.1 million for the total project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| So the county's got 20% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| It was 80-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| This is part of the Blount Locks Greenway that will extend all the way, hopefully one of these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| all the way to the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| And I started to try to go through this 251-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| On track, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| And I quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| I mean, it was just unbelievable that there's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| You know, I think in here where I've seen Charles Blalock and son is going to do the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| They were the low bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| And they've got a lot of moving fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| And, you know, it's just beyond me, just like the CSX contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| I've been dealing with CSX on another issue, and it's three times what it should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| But this greenway is needed, and I agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| But I just want to confirm that since Parks and Rec is not deleting this, the PBA is, there's no fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2742)|
| 0:45:51| no 10% adders or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Yeah, I just wanted to kind of make a comment about the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| I can go back to Plum Creek Park in my district that started prior to my tenure on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| and just now got finished because we were waiting on Parks and Rec to do it and didn't contract it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| And it cost us twice what it should have because we waited so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| So I think that bidding some of these capital projects out is very smart because if you haven't looked at the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| we don't fund them very heavily on capital or overhead to build these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| So I think it's smart to bid some of these things out and get them done quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| I mean, you look at Shod Road, I mean, we've had a graduating class for Shod Road now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| So let's stop trying to act like we can do everything in-house and get some of these projects done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| I appreciate the work you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Shod Road would have come out to $3.4 million a year, which is very manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| This project, the number we have before us is over $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| Does that represent the total of the project or is that the 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| That is the contract with Blalock for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| Total of the project is $1.14 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| And it's what kind of distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| A little over half a mile, .6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Is there any other discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| This item is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| And, by the way, I want to confirm, the original motion we've had a lot of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| was that to approve or to send forward with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| That was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Who's the first and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Smith and Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| So, the motion before us is to approve this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2870)|

| 0:47:53| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Before I move on to the next item, in my effort to work through our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| I forgot to recognize our special visitors and distinguished folks here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| I want to thank Mayor Jacobs and all of his team for joining us tonight at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| So, Mayor Jacobs, thank you so much for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| Nick McBride in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| Thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2892)|

| 0:48:16| I also see my old elementary school friend, Mr. Charlie Susano, in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| So, Charlie, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| And I know he was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| I'm not sure if he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| But Super Bob Thomas, if he's here, I cannot see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| Where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| We're left after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Okay, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Yeah, we sent him out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| And Tonya Coates is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2918)|

| 0:48:41| So, thank you, all of you, for taking the time for this important meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| Now, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Madam Clerk, next item on our agenda, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Page 6, item number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| A resolution designating and committing and appropriating funds in the amount of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| for fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 for various funds and departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| Motion to move and no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Okay, we have a motion to send forward, no recommendation from Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| and a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| We've already kind of reviewed this a good bit at the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| I'm not sure that we need to have, that's just what I want to assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Yeah, the dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| It's 5.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| I guess what I'm going to ask is if the Finance Department could work with Drusilla to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| and Gill, to get the actual dollar amount submitted to us so we can add it to our formal agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| We did talk about this extensively at the Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| and when we get that added to the agenda, we can probably vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| or if there's any additional discussion after this, sitting on it for a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| we could probably have that at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| That sounds appropriate to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Is there any other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| We do have a motion with a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Item number 37 is a resolution regarding the assurance of not to exceed $37,230,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3016)|
| 0:50:25| general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee, resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| I believe we have to vote on them by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| We have a motion to send forward no recommendation from Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| and a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Is there any discussion on this particular item tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| When do you think we'll go to market with this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| Next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Are we anticipating any further interest rate decrease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| There is the possibility of there's talk of one, so we'll watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| But other than that, we'll really rely on our financial advisors from Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| to see when we think it's best to go to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| But there's really an appetite out there for governmental bonds, tax-exempt bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3092)|
| 0:51:41| And so from that standpoint, it's a good time for us to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| Now, if we see that we think that rates are going to get lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| then we could always wait and capitalize on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| So what we wanted to do is come early enough to give us some flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| because we do anticipate a similar rate to what we got the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| which, as you all remember, was pretty substantial, pretty spectacular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| I would anticipate it to be a little bit better because the market is a bit softer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| It could be for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| And what I might add to reiterate what Mr. Caldwell said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| I recall when we did our last bond issuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| and with previous discussions with both Cumberland Securities as well as Stephen Rosen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| we have even looked to try to add municipal bonds even to our county's portfolio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| and it's a tough market just to find them based on us as we try to invest our own county dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| So I would anticipate that there would be pretty solid demand for this issuance, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| I'm sure you'd agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| We do have two related to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| So, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Item number 38 is authorizing the assurance of general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $37,230,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| and one or more series making provision for the assurance sale and payment of said bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| establishing the terms thereof and the disposition of proceeds therefrom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| and providing for the levy of taxes for the payment of principal off premium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| if any, in interest on the bonds, resolution 805.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Commissioner Jay has made a motion to send forward no recommendation with a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Item number 40 is a resolution adopting the Americans with Disabilities Act Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| for Knox County, Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Smith with a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| And I've asked Cindy to provide us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| And I want to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| I believe it may have been as early as the February or March meeting when we talked about this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| Then we revisited briefly in July where we agreed to push this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| And I want to thank Cindy for her hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| We're talking about 20 years' worth or 30 or 40, actually, as it relates to the ADA situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| So I'm going to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Is it 15 minutes or what, 10, 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| How much do you think you're going to need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Hopefully it will take us no more than 10 minutes to do our presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| and then we'll open it up for if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| Okay, that sounds appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| So this is a very high-level introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| What I wanted to let you know is this afternoon I have with us our consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3286)|

| 0:55:04| And with him today is Steve Lewandowski from Accessology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| who also participated heavily in the project, and he will also be able to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3309)|
| 0:55:21| Thanks, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3321)|

| 0:55:26| I want to thank you for the opportunity to present this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| on what's been over a year-long process in helping the county complete the evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3329)|
| 0:55:38| but also develop the transition plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| The ADA was signed in 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| and really the purpose is to prohibit any type of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3345)|
| 0:55:53| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| The basic requirement, and as a Title II agency that the county is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| the responsibility of the county is to make sure that you're not excluding anyone from participating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| any programs, any services or activities that you provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| That extends to, again, as we looked at in evaluating all the different things that the county offers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| that extends not just the facilities but also the different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| Even pedestrian facilities are considered a program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| but it's everything from emergency management plans to communication practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| to programs at a library, after-school programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| So it can be even the eligibility requirements to participate in those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| You see the image there on the screen, the gentleman in a wheelchair and the steps themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| Without an accessible route or a path of travel getting into a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| or some way to get to those public areas, those steps are actually a form of discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| They essentially say that you're not welcome if there's not an accessible route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| In developing the plan, we had some goals and objectives that we established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| with the help of the staff and the various departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Again, Cindy is the ADA coordinator for the county, but it was a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| All the different departments were included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| But we also wanted to make sure we had a fundamental goal of improving access for all the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| There's a requirement that we also encourage participation by the public but also the disability community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| We actually have five or six members of the disability advisory group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| That's the committee that's been established in helping guide the overall plan moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| They're here in attendance tonight, and we want to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| But we also realized early on, and staff was hoping to get educated on more of the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| and how they can do a better job and provide a better level of service to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| But there are some basic requirements as part of the transition plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| First, we need to evaluate all the facilities and all the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| I mentioned that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Through that process, we'll develop a list of barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| The transition plan is a barrier removal plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| It's a master plan for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| As we identify those barriers, we then tell you how to fix them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| We apply costs to those because these aren't going to happen without some require some modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| They may be structural in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Some things may have no cost at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| It's just changing some language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| But then we need to develop a realistic schedule moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| and then develop some ideas on how we're going to fund those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| because this is going to be a plan that's going to extend not just more than one year, maybe 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| and in this case almost 40 years to implement the overall plan based on what we've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| So we've been busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| This is something that we've been looking at over the last over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| In addition to all the different programs, we've looked at every public facility, all the libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| the various senior centers, PBA, all their facilities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| And, again, we mentioned waste centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| But then all the different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| There were 89 school sites, and, again, that's just not one facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| There's entire campuses, all the recreation facilities, all the ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| It could be all the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| So any facility, it's parking, path to travel, making sure that individuals have access to goods and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| And then it's all the amenities that may be offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| It includes all the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| So if there are buildings at park sites, all the amenities, playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| But, you know, parking as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| And then we looked at public rights of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| Public rights of way extends all the different sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| We mentioned greenways in one of the previous agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| And then there were 140 miles of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| So every linear foot of sidewalk, we've been out there and our teams have been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| and evaluating levels of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| And along those routes, there's intersections as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| So all of that, we've looked at the different standards that are applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| and developed a list of barriers that may exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| And then we've provided detailed reporting on what needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| So all of that gets rolled into the transition plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| And, again, identifying the barriers, how we're going to fix those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| And then we prioritize the different barriers because we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| if you're going to be spending your next dollars on improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| what do you need to be focusing on your dollars on next in the highest priority areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| And then developing the schedule and then the overall, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| this is going to be broken up by the various departments in terms of how we're going to implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| But we'll have, you know, Cindy's really going to be the coordinator of all those activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| So I wanted to give you a we actually have a packet that we provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| It's, again, there's a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| It's about 20 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| It had a real brief example of some of the deliverables that we provided the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| This is an example of a facility report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| There are various issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| I mentioned this is an example of a parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Again, as you look at a facility, it's parking, path of travel, and access to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| It doesn't matter if the bathroom is compliant if you actually can't get into the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| We also provide an example of there's also summary costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| The next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| There's in each of these reports has a summary of all the different barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| or violations that were identified within each facility and then the total cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| and then we broke that up by priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| There's high, medium, and low, and I'll explain a little bit of that about what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| We also provide an example here of the public rights away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| At the top is the overall cost projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| So each location, whether it's a corridor or a sidewalk facility or it's an intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| we develop the recommended improvement in order to bring it into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| It also tells you where it's at, and all this is brought into your GIS database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Then we explain what was wrong and what needed to be fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| and then there's also a photo log, which is the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| So you have the ability to go and look and see what the different areas are that we evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| and what was not in compliance at the time the evaluations were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| And again, there was also the summary that I provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| I mentioned prioritization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| So for every barrier that's identified, we prioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| Again, we looked at these things based on do we have a known complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| What's the severity of the noncompliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| Is it a highly publicly used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| There's a lot of pedestrian traffic at these locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Is it a park that's heavily attended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| And also, does it align with some of the Department of Justice priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| And again, we want to make sure that if something's severely out of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| if it's a safety issue and it's used by people on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3808)|
| 1:03:35| that's where you need to be spending your dollars first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| versus something that's barely out of compliance and it's not heavily used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| So we prioritize that for every single barrier that was identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| And then we rolled that into a schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Again, we look at this, the schedule, depending on the overall cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| The cost is to make the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| It needs to be reasonable based on the size of the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| We also look and see are there other projects that are currently committed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| Is it part of an existing capital improvements program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| Are there also other funding sources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Have you been looking at grant programs that exist out there to help fund these projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| But we also look and see are there opportunities to identify line items within your annual budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| to start including improvements specifically related to ADA and the deficiencies that were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3863)|
| 1:04:32| Before we get to the cost, we really want to just kind of talk about some of the most common issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| that were identified, and this is across all the different facility types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| And again, some of these fall in line with some of the highest priorities by the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| Parking is one of the biggest issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| As I mentioned earlier, it doesn't really matter if the facility or the amenities or the bathroom is compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| if you can't get into the facility or if you can't park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| The second most common issue is related to, again, we looked at 140 miles of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| Sidewalks are in poor conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Approximately 50% to 60% of the sidewalks are in a noncompliant condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| Also, at the intersections, curb ramps, and some of the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| noncompliant restrooms were always a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| And then once you get into the facility or at a park site or maybe a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| it's access to some of those public areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| And again, the picture on the bottom right is a playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| It has an area there surrounding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| but it doesn't really have an accessible route to get to that area from the parking areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| So we also provided cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| And so the table that we provided has a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| It identifies the various facility types on the left side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| And then the overall cost for all the different facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| Again, we had 89 school campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| We had all the PVA facilities, all the county buildings, and all the different parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| I think there was 47 parks that were looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| And then the public rights-of-way, 140 miles of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| I think there were 80-plus intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| And then over 1,400 intersections along the sidewalk corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| We broke those up into those priority categories that I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| They were high priority, medium, and low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| The overall total cost for all the different facilities that we evaluated is just under $80 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| And again, that's looking at all the different facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| And again, moving forward, we then wanted to move that into a schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| What's reasonable for an agency the size of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| Discussing with staff, we thought that consistent with other agencies of similar size, 40 years is realistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4001)|
| 1:06:49| which translates into an approximate annual budget of just under $2 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| And that's to make every single improvement all the high, medium, and even the low priority issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| So as you move forward with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| you'll start to look and see what other committed projects are already in the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| How can we start to look at other dollars that can help supplement these costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| Can we look at outside funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| Can we look at partnerships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Can we look at grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| There's a lot of funding through the state that can be applied for that can help minimize the overall cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| But in order to implement and eliminate all the barriers that were identified, it's an annual budget just under $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4046)|
| 1:07:36| So I want to, again, recognize, I mean, Cindy introduced this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| but also she wanted to have the opportunity tonight to talk a little bit about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| that have been accomplished already in developing the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| but some of the other activities that are currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| And we'll turn it over to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| So what have we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Since October of last year, we have amended the employee handbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| We now have things like job accommodation forms, grievance forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| We've added a whole section about the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| We have harassment and retaliation policies as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| In addition, there is a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| It just promises me that I have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| It actually has to show up as a line item in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| That's one of the requirements that TDOT and the federal government is looking for in regards to having a transition plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4109)|
| 1:08:39| In addition to actually having a budget to work with, some things have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| Software was actually purchased by the IT department to make our website actually accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| One of the other things we've done, if you've gone on to the website, we actually have a website presence now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| If you click on the main page and go to LiveVisit Knox, click on it, the first tab that comes up is accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4137)|
| 1:09:06| And underneath that, we have several tabs that tell you our meeting agendas, our minutes, the transition report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4146)|
| 1:09:17| the bylaws for the Dagwood Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Once again, that's our disability advisory group would recommend what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| So there's a lot of stuff that we're starting to piece it together so that people know that we're out there and we're trying to make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4165)|
| 1:09:32| In addition, we are doing training for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| We had two sessions back in February in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| We had a session out at the health department for some of their managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| This week, on tomorrow afternoon and Wednesday afternoon, we're doing two more training sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| Stephanie Cook from the city, she's their ADA coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| She and I have put together a program, and that's what we're teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| It's the same material that we did back in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| We had a schedule to go out to Engineering and Public Works back in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| but unfortunately I had to cancel that because my husband ended up in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| So it'll probably be late fall before we get to go back out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| because this is Engineering and Public Works' busy time to be out taking care of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| In addition to all of that, because I do have the Dagwood Committee, one of my members has a hearing disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4222)|
| 1:10:31| And so as part of that, we have had to add a CART vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| And CART is Communication Access Real-Time Translation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| So during those meetings, we actually have a laptop set up for remote communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| so that someone who's not even located in the state of Tennessee is actually typing in on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4246)|
| 1:10:54| so that he can read it as we're having the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| It is scanning across the screen so that he can participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| It's been a great addition in terms of things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| In addition, as we've talked about, which is why I was here back in January and February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| we actually had the bylaws for Dagwood, the approval of the members who are on Dagwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4269)|
| 1:11:17| All of that happened earlier, which is when you heard about the initial costs of trying to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| We had our first meeting in April, and we continue to meet on the third Thursday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Whoops, that's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| So what we're currently working on is we're trying to get together projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| that we think are top priorities to put in the CIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| Because there is money, I've already been meeting with Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| We've been going out, and we have identified three major sidewalk programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| or projects that we're going to actually proceed with to rehab sidewalk that is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| In addition to those, we're still trying to figure out what our school priorities need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| Based on the report that I've received, evidently it all has to do with the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| in terms of getting from the parking lots to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| Biggest problem flagged as the number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| And then we have all the other facilities, and once again, those are related to the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| of getting from the parking lot out to the park picnic areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| and facilities at those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| We continue to do the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| I welcome you to join us when we actually do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| We're hoping to adopt PROWAG, which stands for the Public Right-of-Way Access Guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| Those are the design standards that are used that TDOT has adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| and that are being recognized across the country in terms of what we should be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| in our public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| In addition, the Dagwood Committee is looking for providing input on existing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| One of the things we're going to be doing at one of our meetings probably in October or November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| is going out to the new West Knox facility for the seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| so that they could actually walk around and check it out to see if it works for them and the disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4392)|
| 1:13:19| It was very interesting in terms of just going out to the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| I took one of the reports just to see how we stood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| We went out to the Carnes facility, which is only four years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| and we've had about 19 different things that need to be fixed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| So just to give you an idea, depending on the size of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| the city-county building I think is 603 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| It's over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| So there's a lot of moving parts and a lot of priorities that we're trying to get our hands around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| And we're continuing to add ADA content to our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| So that's what we have underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| and every day is a new challenge in terms of trying to meet people's questions and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| as they find out that we actually have a department who's trying to handle these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| So on that note, I'd like to open it up for any questions that you might have for the consultants or myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| about anything that you've heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| We've got three lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Frankly, I'm not sure if it was Commissioner Jay or Commissioner Smith whose light came on first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| but I'll recognize Commissioner Jay first, and then Smith, then Anders, then Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| For either one of you, thank you for the hard work and the presentation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| Is the Department of Justice the federal watchdog, for a better way to explain it, over this entire program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4475)|
| 1:14:43| Are they the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Yes, those are the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| They're the group that comes out to sue you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| And what is the runway that they allow counties like ours before they get fines, lawsuits, or levied, things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4490)|
| 1:15:00| I mean, certainly there is some understanding that, you know, it takes time to tackle these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| They do, but there have been suits that they have actually settled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| but the most egregious one that I can think of, I think, was the City of Los Angeles had not been making any progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| and I thought they asked them to make, like, was it $1.5 billion of improvements over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| So you have to show that you are actively working on making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| You have to have a plan, and you have to implement the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| How you go about it, which is why the size of the jurisdiction, the size of the existing budget, plays a part in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| They don't want a token, oh, we're putting $50 in when you've got a larger budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| They want something that is reasonable to show that we are making improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| ADA turned 29 at the end of July, so we are behind in what we are doing, and we are trying to get caught up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4553)|
| 1:16:02| That's one of the reasons why we're trying to stress the need for employee training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| because it's not just about how to treat people that come into our offices in terms of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| but it's also about how we do our reviews, how we do our inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| Have you communicated the 40-year timeline to them? I mean, is it acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4579)|
| 1:16:27| What started all of this was through the Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| We get federal funding for our road projects, which is how I initially got involved with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| but we get federal funds for lots of projects and programs throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| and we could be at risk at losing that should something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| TDOT was asked by Federal Highways to start cracking down on all the local jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| so we are required to have in place by the end of this year, and this is true for every MPO across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| to have a transition plan in place by December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| So at this point, we're slightly ahead of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| I'm hoping that next Monday you'll be voting to adopt the plan so we can continue to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4630)|
| 1:17:19| With the timeline of 40 years...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| More things will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| I'm positive they will, and that's a budget in today's dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| not in the future of God knows what things are going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| But let's just hypothetically say that Internet gambling had a huge windfall of tax revenue coming up in the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4655)|
| 1:17:44| and $80 million was on the bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| What would be the timeline of actually accomplishing everything that you have assessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| if you were to start today with a budget, a full budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| It's certainly not 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| Have you had that fantasy conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| No, I haven't thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| Is it a 20-year realism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Is it 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| I mean, I'm trying to understand the reality versus the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| The reality is there's a lot of work to be done, but you have to recognize what the staff limitations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| in terms of some of this stuff we have to go out and hire consultants and contractors for to do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4694)|
| 1:18:21| in addition to being able to oversee all of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| So did you get to 40 years based upon all those variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| or could the plan be if there was $4 million invested in Knox County every year, could it be 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Okay, so that's not a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| 40 years was recommended by Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| When you all take into consideration another quick question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| when you take into consideration the priority list, the timing of all of our assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| are you also actively in conversations with everywhere from finance to PBA to schools to really assess the needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4736)|
| 1:19:05| And I'd just point out two examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| For instance, in your sampling here, you have a significant report about the Frank Strange Senior Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4747)|
| 1:19:15| which equals almost $80,000 of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| That is certainly a facility that we will not be using very soon because we're moving and we'll be selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| So why would we ever put that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Because when the contract was signed, that's where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| So that's going to drop out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| For instance, Lonsdale School is going to be a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| So you are considering the fact that there's facilities that we will not use or we'll sell or we'll demolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Some of the facilities, particularly for public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| some of the facilities that got evaluated were actually state right-of-way, TDOT maintains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4786)|
| 1:19:54| So I will be having a conversation with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| So that price tag is not all on Knox County potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| I think you alluded to the fact of both reaching out to other government agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| or other entities to help shoulder some of the financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| And that's a case-by-case basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| It's a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| This, that, or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| And it's one of the reasons why Dagwood has that sandwich because this is huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| and we're going to have to take small bites to make this come together and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| Well, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| I'll just close my remarks by just saying I appreciate the hard work you all are doing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| This is a massive, massive undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| I personally would love to see the timeline accelerated a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| I don't think any of us will be sitting here, you know, 40 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| But this is a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| This is a serious project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| It's not a matter of that we have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| It's a matter that we should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| And we should take it very seriously and we'll put some real resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| I certainly am not going to speak for other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| but as one of the commissioners here that has spent a significant amount of time in a wheelchair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| I understand this, and it is a different perspective when you try to navigate the basics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| and much less participate in the things that are above and beyond the day-to-day survival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| So I appreciate the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| I know some of your members are here that are part of the crew, and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| I would hope that this body would take it seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| and put some real resources against it to make a real effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| and not just pass it along for the next 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| I'll be about a third of what he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| Cindy, I do appreciate all the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| I know the hard work you've been putting in at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| I think you said that we had roughly 160 miles of sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| and roughly 50% to 60%, somewhat that's 70 miles of sidewalks that are in noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| Sounds right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| What percentage of our greenways are in noncompliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| We'll have to look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| Do we have any checks and balance so that the current projects we have going on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| we won't be digging up in six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| Hopefully we won't be digging stuff up in six months that's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| Once again, that goes back to how well we do on the actual construction and inspection portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| But we don't have anything right now where we're going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| and making sure we're in compliance with everything we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| I'm not sure what you mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| I know, like, as Jim proceeds, like, with the Shod Road project, that is going to meet ADA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| He's aware of that, and that's part of what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| As part of the Shod Road project, he was going to roll in some of the existing sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| on the Shod Road that's already been constructed does not meet ADA standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| and he's going to roll that into that construction contract to get a better price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| and to get that fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| And we just approved the Greenway, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| That will be being checked, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Should be checked as that makes progress as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| Every project we have going right now, we will make sure we are doing compliance work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| so that we don't have to turn around and redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| That is the goal, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| What about over the years we've approved a lot of subdivision sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| that will be the county's responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| They already are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Oh, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| The ones that you've accepted, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| They've accepted, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| They're ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| What if we get into subdivisions that have topography that will not allow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| to be reconstructed in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| There is an exception rule that you're allowed to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| but you have to document why you are not able to make the item ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| I've not written anything, and I've not read an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| Brian, do you have any familiarity with what you need to do for an exception?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5048)|
| 1:24:16| The key is that you just document why you can't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| and you have to have a really good reason why you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| The nice thing about sidewalks, they can follow the natural grade of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| The rise-run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| That's also in the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| When you cross a street, then there are some other requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| or you get to an intersect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| But the sidewalk can follow the natural terrain of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| As you start to meander and go off the path and kind of beautify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| and berm it and all this stuff, then there are some grade requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| But sidewalk, I mean, that's why you have, well, out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| you have significant grades, but, you know, you look at San Francisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| I mean, the world's not flat, and the disability community recognizes that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| but you just need to make it as accessible as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| Well, what was the problem with the new sidewalks on Shod Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| If it's not following the grade of the topography of the land, is it the intersections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| I believe that's part of the problem, but then you also have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| particularly on some roadways, the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| you have people that like to park on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| It could be a utility company that's gone in to do work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| and once they've driven up on it, it has caused what was in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| no longer to be in compliance, and that may be what the case is on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| I'm not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| I haven't had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| There is a wealth of information in the report that they've put together for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| in terms of the number of pages to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| I have not taken a look at Shod Road in particular to be able to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| but I can get back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| To answer your question, Commissioner Smith, the greenways, just over 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| They're actually in better condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Just over 40% are not compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| How long have we been doing greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| I guess really the question is, are you going to plot these on KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| to where we could, like, divide them up by our district or these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| or are they plotted out on our KGIS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| When we did the initial evaluation for the sidewalks that we want to proceed with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| what we chose for our criteria was whether or not the sidewalk was in a parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5194)|
| 1:26:43| We did it on GIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| We also have, for the sidewalks at this point, we've taken the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5206)|
| 1:26:54| and for sidewalks we've put how many miles are within each commissioner's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| and whether or not it was a high, medium, or low priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| What I was asking was data points of, like, the Carnes Senior Center that's very new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| Are each of these projects plotted out in KGIS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Like, all the schools, all the projects, all the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| or are they plotted so we can see them by our district so we can see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Is that in the plan or is that feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| I would say it's feasible because what I'm trying to do is trying to use some kind of logic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| in terms of how we're going to attack the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| So we're looking at, you know, what kind of population density is around the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| around the library, around the senior center, to try to get a feel for how active is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| especially since everything is sidewalk related in terms of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| We're trying to develop criteria for each of the uses to figure out what our top needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| That's what we're in the process of trying to figure out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| And I appreciate the hard work associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| So I just want to ask some fundamental questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| What is your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| I believe Chris told me $600,000 for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| Because my concern is do we have people tied because you can do so much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| Do you have a contact person in the libraries that will be responsible, in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| in our public works, to help support the work that you're doing, to help assign those priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5312)|
| 1:28:40| and not only by district, and have a basic understanding of that particular checklist we're trying to identify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5320)|
| 1:28:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| I have been starting to reach out to the different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| The different department heads were all part of the initial presentations that Kim Lee Horn did last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5332)|
| 1:29:00| But I have since then been reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| I've met with engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| I've met with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| I have talked on the phone with schools a little bit, but we haven't really gotten into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| And like I said, I'm starting to reach out to the other ones as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| just to kind of let them know what the problems are that have been found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| on what they have been provided for in terms of the plans so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| And is the information you're gathering inputted into a software or it's, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5369)|
| 1:29:37| how is the information assembled and assessed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| Is it pencil and paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Is it in a computer program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| They provided me with Excel spreadsheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| The consultant has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| And then when that information is inputted, is it assigned the priority at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| or is it assigned geographically at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| How is it inputted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| It's got a priority depending on what the category is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| Some are categorized one through four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| I want to say traffic signals, things related to that, are ranked one through 13, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| But you've got to realize a lot of things have the same priority number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| and that's where it gets complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| trying to figure out which ones of those should really rise to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| What rank order are we having?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| And let me ask a question because you mentioned this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| Did we look at the accessibility of the front and the roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| or did you even enter into this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| I believe that was a separate section, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| So this building has a separate section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| This building, on some of the facilities what they did was they pulled out separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5452)|
| 1:31:00| how the access worked for that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Other ones they rolled it in as part of the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| but this one I think had two different sets of data on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| But they did look at the accessibility of the building from the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| So here's my last statement to see whether or not we're moving in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| As we look at resolutions, do we need an ADA ledger next to those resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| to look at where we are as we approve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Because if the fiscal note impacts, if the ADA impacts resolutions we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| that look at schools, is there a way to determine where those can fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| to say that we're noncompliant on our?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| What I'm hoping for is as the budgets continue down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5506)|
| 1:31:53| that you will actually have projects called out that are going to be done as part of ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| because I actually have to keep track of which ones we have completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| so I know what's still out there to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| And then we also have some existing projects that are underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| that have an ADA element in those and I can take credit for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| because they're already funded through a different mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| and we can get credit for having those projects fixed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| So do we need them to be indicated as we move forward on those resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| It would probably help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| The responsibility on sidewalks, I know that's the number one thing that you have on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| In my district we have Emory Road that has been redone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| and all the way from Clinton Highway all the way through the halls almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| we have sidewalks on both sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| Now, there is no ADA crossing at any of the corners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| There has been utility work done where they've cut up the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| and still haven't repaved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| It's been there for almost three years and it's just covered up with rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| Whose responsibility is that? Is that the state's or is that the county's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| It depends on the section because I thought the county took over a portion of Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| once Powell Drive was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| The majority of Emory Road, though, is a state route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| so it should be within TDOT's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| So Powell Drive is the state's responsibility, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| So we don't have to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Now, inside subdivisions, do we have a quality of concrete that the developers are supposed to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5616)|
| 1:33:47| because they can use cheap concrete and in two years it disintegrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| Do we have codes to make sure that that concrete is supposed to be state grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| I mean the better grade concrete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| I would suggest Mr. Snowden answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5640)|
| 1:34:14| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| We do obtain tickets from the concrete trucks to ensure that the mix is a TDOT standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| as well as our guys are trained in slump and air and some of the tests that are required to run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5662)|
| 1:34:29| not to say we run those tests on every batch, but if the batch looks suspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| yes, we do further investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| They did utility work out there around Emory Road and into some of the subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| where they're putting down new gas lines and things of that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| and large trucks are getting up on those sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| Sidewalks are not standard for heavy-duty trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| How can we stop that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| Because if we fix it once and we get out of compliance that we've got sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| all through some of these subdivisions, how are we going to keep up with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| and who's going to pay for that when they tear it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| And one of the things we do there to, Commissioner, to try to prevent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| is the driveway approaches themselves where the sidewalk ramps down to the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| We require those to be poured six inches thick, whereas the sidewalk is four inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| So where those trucks are designed to go, yes, we do have a thicker section to allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| Now, if someone pulls up on that four-inch section, yeah, that's problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| and if we witness it, we can require that they repair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| But those areas are somewhat problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| All right, thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| Oh, excuse me, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Actually, Commissioner Schoonmaker's slide had rung in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| Do you mind if I made a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| Sure, I just had a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Okay, go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Go ahead, quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| Cindy, on the slide that you presented with the numbers up there, the $79 million and change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| can you send that to all of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| It's not in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| We didn't want you to pass out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| That's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| Okay, go ahead, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Mr. Snowden, I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| I've never really looked into it, but if you have a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| and we'll use Commissioner Bussler's district that's not developer or neighborhood friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| and they do bust up a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| is there a specific guideline when we start to get into the ADA standards of when it needs to be repaired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| I know that's TDOT's area, that's a state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| but can you just enlighten me on some of the timeline, I guess, is what you could say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| Yeah, and we work hand-in-hand with TDOT's traffic office and maintenance division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| that issues those permitting locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| and we will use our codes office to hold building permits or final inspections and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| to ensure that those locations get repaired to our satisfaction and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| So we work pretty hand-in-hand with those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| So how long do they usually have to take out a section of sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| to do whatever they have to do before they get into the gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| Each case is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| I think it depends on the location of the sidewalk and how much usage it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| If it's a pretty heavily used section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| we would like to try for those folks to get fixed within five to seven business days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| or within a reasonable time frame, assuming weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| Thank you. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| Looks like we've got some rain coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| I guess this is for procurement, EPW, and perhaps the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5860)|
| 1:37:47| Are we requiring that our current contracts have language in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| holding the contractor responsible for ADA compliances on our projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5871)|
| 1:38:01| I can give you a little insight, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| Yes, what we do, one of the things we do is we hold retainage on our projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| because sidewalks are usually one of the last things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| So we hold 5% of all work completed up to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| So through the life of the project, we hold that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| and those are the things that we take a smart level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| and we actually measure each panel of sidewalk and each driveway approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| to make sure it's in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| If it's not, we will hold that retainage until such time it is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| So we have a mechanism in which to correct those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| Do we have any mechanism for as time goes by for settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| if they didn't do compaction right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Yes, we have typically on a capital project, we have a three-year warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| So three years from the, if it is a workmanship issue, yes, they will repair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| If it's something, you know, like Commissioner Bussell was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| where it was just obvious disregard, then no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| But if it's a material issue, we do have three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| Okay, any? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Yeah, go ahead, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| Since I was brought up in this discussion, really simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| so you got an $80 million price tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| What wasn't talked about was that 20 to 25 million of that is directed to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5965)|
| 1:39:33| and related to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| So we're having conversations with schools about them paying for their portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| while we pay for our portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| If it's a building that is jointly owned, like the city-county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| a city-county owned that ran by PVA, we would break that cost out with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| And so some of those are, helps to bring that cost down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| And you can look at it into silos, like I like to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| Cindy and I had a conversation about breaking it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| not only for prioritizing it from highest to low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| but prioritizing it from schools, engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| and then non-engineering and public works and tackling it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| And so I think that's one way of looking at it, and I think that's a way of going about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| We, I've said this in the past, our intent is to pay for this majority with cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| I know that there will be certain issues, certain corrections that Jim will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| as he does some of his work that could be bond-related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| but for the most part our goal is to pay with cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| Mr. Chairman, I have one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Yeah, Commissioner Smith, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| Cindy, on your list you had the libraries, you had the libraries, you had the senior centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6047)|
| 1:40:57| all the schools, and then 20 additional buildings by PVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| Do you have a list of those buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| I'm trying to think of what buildings we have that PVA managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| I want to say it's stuff like the health clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| There's the, hang on, I don't know if I brought the list with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| You can just send that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| I can send you the list of the PVA managed facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| And whenever you talk of this building, would this not be a shared cost building with the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| We have the budgeted numbers as well on the final total that was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| Budgeted totals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6099)|
| 1:41:47| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| Madam Clerk, who is it that made the first and the second on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| And, by the way, this is an ordinance that requires a two-third vote on the first rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| so we need to do a roll call vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| This is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| It's not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Resolution considering an ordinance of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| I've jumped ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| Forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| I've jumped ahead on my agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| So I was already reading ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Who was it that made the first and the second on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| So the original motion was by Commissioner Smith with the second by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Thank you, Cynthia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| The meeting is getting a little bit long in a tooth, so I want to kind of make an executive call just as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| I know we've got a guest here tonight to speak this, and Mr. Geriaske, who helped co-facilitate our recent retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6165)|
| 1:42:54| If it meets the desire of this body, what I'd like to do is skip forward on the agenda to that particular discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| Upon the conclusion of that discussion item, we will take a ten-minute recess for everyone to have a quick break, if that pleases this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6180)|
| 1:43:13| Mr. Askew, is that agreeable to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| Is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Everybody just kind of nod your heads if everybody's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| I thought he was enjoying the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| I thought Mr. Askew was really enjoying the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| I thought he wanted to stay for the whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| You know what, Jerry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| We can keep here all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| Lionel Richie, the theme song, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| It was all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| What I'd like to do to open off this discussion is, first of all, I can say speaking for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| I've heard time and time again over the last two years from my constituents about, you know, sometimes they feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| it's not always the case, but there's often feelings that we're not doing planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| we're not looking forward, we're not thinking about the next five years, ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| And as we've seen tonight, which is this is actually a great segue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| we just listened to a very important group in our community talk about the need for 40-year plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6239)|
| 1:44:06| as it relates to bringing this community up and compliant with some of the ADA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| And this body met just a few weeks ago to take a look at so many things that we each saw as something that we were passionate about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6253)|
| 1:44:22| and analytically thought that would be a priority for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| So tonight at this meeting, we are going to formally present this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| and I'll read through these top priorities as I wait to present this to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| Then I'm going to ask Jerry Askew to provide his assessment briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| And then I'm going to ask Commissioner Jay, who I want to thank for bringing this idea to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| So first and foremost, looking through this, as we recall, the commission met at Johnson Bible College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6285)|
| 1:44:54| under the facilitation of Jerry Askew from the Alliance for Better Nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| to help identify what we each saw and saw together as a team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| some of the priorities for this body as we look forward in the short run and the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6303)|
| 1:45:10| The one that we saw that was the first priority was the county must develop a comprehensive plan for growth and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6310)|
| 1:45:17| which includes a review of current zoning regulations and consideration of amendments as necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| and then commit to maintaining discipline in zoning enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| The following commissioners agreed to assist and take the lead on this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| Anders, Beeler, Carringer, Daly, Gill, Nystrom, Schoonmaker, and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| Item number two, the county should investigate the feasibility of more effective use of tax incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| i.e. tax incremental financing to incentivize the county's growth and development objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| The following commissioners agreed to take the lead on this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| Anders, Biggs, Nystrom, and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| Point number three, the county must develop a comprehensive infrastructure plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| including future road construction, the development of connectivity corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| linking key communities throughout the county, greenway development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| and the utilities needed to support the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| An analysis of cost associated with each element of the plan should be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| and the following commissioners agreed to take the lead on this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| Anders, Beeler, Biggs, Carringer, Daly, Gill, Jay, Nystrom, and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| Number four, the county commission, along with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| must lead the community in an honest conversation about the county's financial status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| including discussions around tax structure and rates, priorities for future investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| and overall sustainability given the county's growing population and demand for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| The following commissioners agreed to take the lead on this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| Anders, Carringer, Gill, Jay, Nystrom, and Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| And fifth was the commission should work with the office of the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| to enhance communication between and among the various elements of county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| so that surprises are minimized and efforts to enhance the quality of life throughout the county are coordinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| The following commissioners agreed to take the lead on this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| Beeler, Biggs, Carringer, Daly, Gill, Jay, Nystrom, and Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| I know Commissioner Buster will also be signing up for several of these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| He stepped out of the room when everybody picked their committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| There were so many other priorities and ideas that came before this body during the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| These were the top five, and it's not to say that some of the others we won't be getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| They're all important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| But another big thing that's so important about this is we came together to think about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| And as part of our culture, and I think what our constituents want to see out of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| is that type of commitment to be thinking about the future and not being so reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| You know, begin with the end in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| So with that said, it's really a pleasure just to have been able to read this into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| and I'm going to ask my old friend, Dr. Jerry Askew, Pastor Jerry Askew, to share his take as our facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6477)|
| 1:48:06| Jerry, if you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| Sure. I'm Jerry Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| I live at 701 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| I am the president of the Alliance for Better Nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| Let me just simply say, just briefly, the Alliance for Better Nonprofits is a nonprofit itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| that specializes in providing training and consulting services for nonprofit organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| throughout the 25 counties of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| We have about 350 members who work with us to improve their capacity to carry out their missions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6513)|
| 1:48:43| So we are thrilled to have been a part of your inaugural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6523)|
| 1:48:49| Let me say, for those in the public who might be interested in what we did, we had a two-day retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6529)|
| 1:48:58| The first day, we had presentations from, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| some of the most impressive public officials I've had the opportunity to interact with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| Mayor Jacobs, Superintendent Thomas, Director Buchanan, Sheriff Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| Executive Director Green, and Finance Director Chris Caldwell all came to the retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6553)|
| 1:49:22| with what was in my estimation open hearts and a willingness to share their perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6562)|
| 1:49:30| but also hear from the commission, and it was a very respectful dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6570)|
| 1:49:36| and I appreciated being able to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| I want to thank you not only for allowing us to be a part of the process, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| The entire two-day period, from my perspective, I saw a commission that was fully engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6585)|
| 1:49:52| that was forward-leaning and forward-thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| and that was unified in their concern for the betterment of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| That was the sole priority for the entire two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| It's a very rare thing to see in a governmental body the willingness to take a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6604)|
| 1:50:13| and dedicate it to nothing but the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| Without that, though, our community is going to continue to be reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| And let's face it, you guys have to put out a lot of forest fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| People who come here rarely complain about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| They are generally concerned with what's already happened, and they are looking to you to find solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| So I didn't really come with any – I knew you were going to present the priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| I will. I encourage people to look at those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| I think they're priorities that recognize the necessity for teamwork between the elected administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6644)|
| 1:50:52| and the elected body representing the people as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| So we're glad to have been a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| We'll look forward to continuing to be a part of it, if that's something that you desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| But my primary goal in being here, and I really was – I encouraged Mr. Jay to allow me to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6664)|
| 1:51:13| I think that if the people of Knox County could have been present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6673)|
| 1:51:18| they would be very proud of what you all did for two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| and they would have a lot more confidence in our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| So I thank you as both the president of the Alliance for Better Nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| and as a citizen, a taxpaying citizen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| I would say, Mr. Askew, this is not one of those things where we're trying to create something to put in a binder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6693)|
| 1:51:40| and it was step one, and we're going to continue to work on this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| So I'm now going to ask Commissioner Jay – go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| I would – if anybody had any other questions or comments for you or Dr. Askew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6710)|
| 1:51:56| I'd happily relinquish the floor for a minute before I enter my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| I was going to say, if anybody has any questions for Dr. Askew or any general discussion points – all right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6720)|
| 1:52:08| I do think – I just want to point out, too, that to our mayor and our department heads who are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| we walked out of that two-day retreat with a comprehensive understanding and agreement amongst the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6733)|
| 1:52:21| of what it is that we wanted to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| And I think it's just to point out that these are topics in which you're going to have a welcome commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6745)|
| 1:52:34| and I hope that you'll take a moment to really read through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| and think about the future as you plan budgets or other items, sort of big-picture items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| So I'm kind of straining my head to look over to our mayor and her team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| but we spent a lot of time on that, and I hope you'll take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| I wanted to add one more comment to tonight, and I did this by – it takes a little bit of effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6771)|
| 1:52:57| so I appreciate the extra time, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| But since it sort of brought everybody into the fold a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| recently an Internet blogger has really criticized Knox County Commission for holding a retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| and he accused me of personal serious conflict of interest violations with the Alliance for Better Nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| So I just wanted to take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Normally I would suggest that, you know, we as a body not take time to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| respond to every unfounded criticism online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| but this instance I felt like it was pretty important that we reply by carefully laying out the facts and the events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6807)|
| 1:53:35| mostly because everybody's been sort of folded into this over the last couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| I just want to remind everybody, the first commission discussion we had about strategic planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| was in the March 2018 commission work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| wherein I had a discussion item where I shared a simple question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| which is what is the essential role and responsibility of local government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| That was a great discussion, and it was very engaging and productive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| and from that we all agreed that holding a strategic planning retreat would benefit the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| and ultimately the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| During that same meeting, as I had sort of brought up the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| eventually through that discussion was appointed by the commission chairman to lead the planning efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| To gather feedback from all of you, soon thereafter, Thursday, March 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| I sent an online survey to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| Information was also posted on the public commission online forum, not including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6861)|
| 1:54:28| Nine of the ten other commissioners responded to the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| and very specifically question five of that survey, which is actually still on the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| specifically asked do you have a suggestion for a professional moderator to lead the retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| Only one person suggested a moderator, the name of Jody Lentz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| After reviewing Mr. Lentz's website, I noticed that he was located in Nashville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| so I assumed in hiring an out-of-town facilitator it would create additional expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| so frankly looked for a local option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Based on my own experience, I suggested a well-known and highly respected local facilitator, Dr. Jerry Askew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| who serves as the president of the Alliance for Better Nonprofits, otherwise known as ABN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| At the April 2019 commission work session, I presented the results of the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| and made recommendations to you, the commission, about the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| In the presented document, I recommended hiring the Alliance for Better Nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| and its president, Dr. Jerry Askew, as a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| No objection was given by any member of the commission or the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| Again, at the May commission work session, I provided a written update to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| and the public outlining the next steps for hiring ABN as a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| and again, no objection was raised by anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| In June, I passed along the contract from ABN for the retreat facilitation to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| No objection was made by the Knox County Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| and the contract was executed soon thereafter by law director Bud Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| and commission chairman Hugh Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| And the final details of the retreat were posted on the commission public online forum in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| including the name of the facilitator, Dr. Jerry Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| To be clear, I have consistently represented myself as a board member for the Alliance for Better Nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| It's listed on my official commission bio on the county's website, knoxcounty.org, slash commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6967)|
| 1:56:14| and on my personal constituent page website, larsonj.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| Additionally, when I presented the idea of hiring ABN to commissioners at the April work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| I fully disclosed that I am a board member of the Alliance for Better Nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| Everyone is welcome to visit the community television website, ctvknox.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| and watch the April 15th work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| They will see, starting at minute 209, that I took time to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=6996)|
| 1:56:40| and specifically disclose my ABN board membership very publicly to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| As I said in the beginning of my remarks, heavy criticism was thrown at all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| for even holding a strategic retreat, suggesting that as office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| we should never look past our term or plan for the future of this great county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| I find this both absurd and insulting to the citizens who elected each of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| to not only serve their needs now, but also find ways to better this community well into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| The internet blogger also criticized the expense of the retreat, which totaled $4,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| Regardless of the fact that these funds were paid out of the properly budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| and approved commission chairman's discretionary funds, thank you, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| I'd like to point out that with a budget of $853 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| the expense of this strategic planning retreat represents .0005%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| And I'd hope that you'd join me in believing that the taxpayers of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| would support our efforts to hold our first ever strategic retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| thoughtfully plan and execute it, and justifiably spend 5 ten thousandths of 1% of their tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7057)|
| 1:57:44| to help support the stewardship and future of close to a billion dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| of their annual investment in the future of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| In closing, I want to thank you all for attending the summer strategic planning retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| I want to thank Dr. Jerry Askew and his team for doing such a great job facilitating for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| And I also want to thank Dr. Tommy Smith and his team at Johnson University for hosting the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| I heard from many of you after the fact that you valued the retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| and if you want me to, I'll look forward to planning again next summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| and continue to work together to build a better Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| I'd like to make a motion he plans it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| As I mentioned earlier, we're sitting right at 7 o'clock, and we still have some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| You know, some of those earlier meetings this year, I remember we did one in an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| and I said, don't worry, we'll have to pay it back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| So please remember the meeting early in my term that we did the whole meeting in one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| But we still have a few things to get through in tonight's work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| So I'm going to give us a 10-minute recess and then reconvene at 7.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| And, frankly, hopefully we will sort of get things tightened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| and pay you back time-wise at next Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| So a 10-minute recess beginning right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Okay, good evening and welcome back from recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| We are now reconvening the meeting of the Knox County Commission August work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7143)|
| 1:59:10| Madam Clerk, what's the next item on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| On page 7, item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| This is a resolution amending the Knox County Commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| by adding a provision to Rule 5, Section N, Standing Committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| to require all standing committees of the commission to meet at least one time per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| and committee chairs to submit a report to the commission chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| summarizing the work of the committee by August 1st of each year, Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Okay, we have a motion to approve from Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| The second was from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| I'm going to recommend an amendment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| Jill from the Law Department pointed this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Our standing committees do meet once a year, and that's the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| So I think we need to add language one meeting other than the reorganization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| Oh, shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| Now you're going to make us make an extra meeting day, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| Go ahead, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| Can I respond to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| The purpose of the discussion in the Rules Committee was let's look at a year or two of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7213)|
| 2:00:22| to see if these rules, number one, these committees ever meet, and if they have any substance to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| Now, some of them we have to do because they're state or some kind of law requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| But I think it's just an efficiency issue to look over the next year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| to see if there's any reason for that committee to continue meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| If they're only meeting to organize and being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| then there's no reason to have the committee unless the law requires it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| And I think that's the site of that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| Okay, so you want to leave it as it is, as it's written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| I guess, hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| I've got a lot of lights on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| All right, Commissioner Smith, originally you still had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| However, Commissioner Anders had added on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| I'm seeing lights from Commissioner Jay, Biggs, Bussler, and Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| It was Commissioner Jay's recommendation, so I'd like to hear his thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| Okay, go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| There's one additional reason for presenting this at the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| It was also, if you'll notice in the language, about submitting a report to the Commission Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| summarizing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| It was also for continuation of education and engagement on those committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| whereby either commissioners who were previously not on that committee might gain what did they do last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7289)|
| 2:01:37| For instance, if Commissioner Daley wasn't on joint education last year and he came to joint education this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7297)|
| 2:01:44| he might be able to look at the summary report from last year to kind of get up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| But it also created an additional sort of archive record for new commissioners that may join the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7308)|
| 2:01:54| and be put on a committee to then look at, okay, what was the summary of what did we do last year, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| so they might get up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| So there's sort of an additional level of why this was introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| And that was introduced to call a meeting, and then you added to consider let it sit where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7326)|
| 2:02:13| I'm just looking at you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| Commissioner Jay, any additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| Well, I'd just say I think that if there's a law department language that says we have to meet once other than when we reorganize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7338)|
| 2:02:26| but we don't call the meetings to order when we reorganize, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| We do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| Each one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| One after the other after the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| That is a meeting with minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| So it's actually called an official meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| It's not just an appointment session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| I mean, the idea separate of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| So if it requires some language, I think that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| But the idea being if you had a committee that never met, you know, at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| I mean, you have to at least meet once a year and be productive and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| And then I think that it also lends a little bit of weight to the chairmanship of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| that you're actually taking a step to not only organize it but summarize thoughts and put ideas together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| So we have committees that start actually, you know, engaging and not just existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| So that's my final thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| I like the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| The reason being is because, like, if you take the arena use committee where Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| Carringer, and myself met, we got to see the opportunity of the alcohol coming to Thompson Bowling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7396)|
| 2:03:22| before it was even really started to be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| So we knew things like concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| And we got some data, data that actually I've used whenever I've been speaking at HOAs and other things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7406)|
| 2:03:33| So one of the things that concerns me about it, though, is I would like to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| if there's a hot button issue coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| I'd like to be able to post on the forum that maybe the other commissioners could come to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| Like, I'm on TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| There's things that we will be doing at the beginning of the month that could affect Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| and Anders specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| And it being the committee and things like that, I think it's a great move to be able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| and tell you and give you a commission, you know, give you an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| and also if you would like to come to these issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| So I think it's a good move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| Thank you, Commissioner Bates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| I think one of those extra meetings, like, I hate to agree with you, Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| but I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| It kind of hurts me to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| But anyway, what you have to do is when you take a meeting and you take minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7461)|
| 2:04:29| then the next meeting you have to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| So it's an ongoing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| If you have a meeting, then you have to have some way to approve the minutes for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| So you're going to have to have a meeting and you're going to have to have another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| so you have the minutes approved so you show you are functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| And, again, I mentioned in that meeting, rules committee, that I was on the railroad committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| And when I got on the railroad committee, it hadn't met in about 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7492)|
| 2:04:58| But then the economy comes back and we've already had about three meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| And we've had one meeting that I had to go to Nashville with to meet down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| with the other railroad officials down there, the things that are coming up in funding and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7506)|
| 2:05:13| So you guys maybe have to have those committees standing and meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| So if there's a situation that comes up, you don't have to come back before the commission here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| and say, we need that committee back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| Then you have to post it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| You have to vote on it and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| You can react to it real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| So I think that extra meeting that you have, and even if they don't do anything that year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| it may be next year that something comes up that you have to use those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| So we need to look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| And I think it's a good deal that we do have an extra meeting besides the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7542)|
| 2:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| So I'm going to look back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| So Charlie agreed with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| I'm going to change my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| Should the proper motion before us, which I believe the original motion was just to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7558)|
| 2:06:05| but should we amend this and maybe send it forward to next week with updated language that says two meetings instead of one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7565)|
| 2:06:14| I just want to kind of figure out exactly what we're voting because I'm hearing this body say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| I'm here for the pleasure of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| It was pointed out to me that standing committees meet the day we reorganize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| and that would count as one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| I didn't make the original motion, but I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| I think if we could send it forward without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| knowing that we might have some slightly amended law department language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| then it would still keep the spirit of the law unless our law director wants to chime in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| We just brought out the comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| It's however you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| This is a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| It's not a legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| But we just noted it said you're going to meet one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| And I thought in reading what I thought your purpose was, you wanted to say that they had a real meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7624)|
| 2:07:11| and we wanted to draw to your attention that you have a special call standard meeting of every committee once a year anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7631)|
| 2:07:19| and that would meet what you asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| And I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| We weren't sure that was the intent of what you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| And we just wanted to bring that out so you all can decide what it is you really wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| Would it be satisfied if it was amended to just say two times and then we could move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| Yeah, that would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| Would that still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| I think that would meet the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| One meeting beyond the organizational meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| So, but that's not in the current language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| So, I guess, who was the maker of the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| I'll amend my motion to amend the rule to one meeting plus or reorganization plus one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7670)|
| 2:08:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| Is the second okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| That was Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| So, the motion that is before us, we have a proper first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| Before discussion, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| Well, that's what I was talking about also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| One time but to submit a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| So, that didn't mean to submit a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| That didn't mean we were having another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| That was just asking the chairman to submit the report from that one-time meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| According to how it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| It just means summarize the work of the committee, the annual work of the committee by August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| I'm sorry to jump back in here, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| But the idea being as well that this would start this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| And so, by August 1st of 2020, every committee chairman, chairperson will submit a report that summarizes what happened during this time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7722)|
| 2:08:56| And then that would give us opportunity next August leading into our reorganization to sit down and go, you know, is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7736)|
| 2:09:04| Is it not working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| And then rebuild it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| That's why I think it's important to put what Brad just put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7747)|
| 2:09:12| Because that first meeting is considered a reorganization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| And that's all televised and that's all documented as to what went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| So, you'd have to have another meeting within the year for the chairman to submit something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7760)|
| 2:09:26| Because we already know what went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| Yes, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| Real quick, I just, the more I think about it, this is when people look at the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7772)|
| 2:09:40| they say, okay, they're going to meet even when they don't have a topic or an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| And so, that's really government in action is if there are no minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| so if you have a reorganization meeting and there's no other action to come before the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| why put in the work to do it to cause the clerk, to cause the office, to cause the law department more work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7796)|
| 2:10:05| We already know the committee didn't meet, so why should we have another meeting to talk about not meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7805)|
| 2:10:13| I mean, I get the education, the component, but the education can come through reading the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7813)|
| 2:10:22| And so, either we get better at doing our minutes to provide that education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| but if you just say, I mean, the Railroad Committee, if it's met, that's probably the, or the Ag Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7827)|
| 2:10:33| let's use the Ag Committee, it hasn't met in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| Actually, we've met, I think the Ag Committee's met at least three times I can think of in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| But, I mean, it went years without, the Cable Committee hasn't met in a century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| And so, we're going to meet without even having a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| That just doesn't make efficient sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7854)|
| 2:11:01| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| I think, though, that the point being, if we come to every August and we look at a summary report of everything that happened in that committee for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7865)|
| 2:11:15| and you see ten committees and eight have had meetings and minutes and are effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| then we have an opportunity to say, hey, maybe these two are not necessary or, you know, relevant to where we are in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7881)|
| 2:11:30| I mean, there's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| If you didn't meet, you didn't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| But the goal here is to try to professionalize commission a little bit further to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| committees have to mean something and they have to be engaged and they have to do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7898)|
| 2:11:44| They don't just exist for the sake of existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| So, I don't think it's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| I think it shows a little bit of a level of professionalism that we need to start moving things through committees first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7908)|
| 2:11:55| before they just come on the floor and, you know, have not been vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| Go ahead, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| We do meet on reorganization, and this resolution says that the chairman, chairperson, chairlady has to write a report for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7926)|
| 2:12:16| That could be the day of the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| Let's take insolvency board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| Not every year will the insolvency board meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| So, if I'm the chairman, I would say the insolvency board met on September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| We elected so, so, and so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| Meeting was adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| And then the next year it might have to meet because there's an insolvency board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| I don't think it's necessary to meet two times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| You don't necessarily need to meet two times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| You meet the first time to reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| That chairman is responsible to report the minutes and what that committee did by August the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7964)|
| 2:12:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| Sorry, her light on was previously Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| Well, I mean, that's what I was talking about, Carson, is the minutes are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| They're already in the book from the reorganization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| So, what the chairman doesn't need to write minutes up from what happened and submit them because they're already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7987)|
| 2:13:16| They're already out for the public to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| I think the reason why all these committees are there is because apparently sometime in the past we have needed those committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8001)|
| 2:13:29| and with serving the community and all, there was a reason to have these certain committees in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8009)|
| 2:13:38| so that we have them in place in case something does come up within that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8018)|
| 2:13:45| We've already got a committee of commissioners and people to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8025)|
| 2:13:51| So, personally, I don't see, and it's no offense to nobody, but I don't really see having this on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8031)|
| 2:14:06| I think we're already doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| And if we meet more than, if a committee meets, you know, we're all invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| Just like I was at the rules committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| I do not sit on rules committee this meeting or this year, so I did not comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8057)|
| 2:14:23| I set out because I was not a part of that committee, so I didn't make any comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8063)|
| 2:14:30| But I kind of feel like we're just sort of beating a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| I feel like everybody that's a chairman of every committee that we're put on, that we all take that very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8073)|
| 2:14:41| And as a commitment, if the need comes to meet for that committee, that whoever we elect as chair and vice chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8081)|
| 2:14:48| they're going to do it and they're going to report whatever needs to be reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8088)|
| 2:14:54| And every commissioner is always invited to come to all of the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| They're out in the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| So I think, and if we do meet, those meetings and those minutes are taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8102)|
| 2:15:09| and they're there provided if anybody wants to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| I'm going to, adding to that amendment, I'm going to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| So somebody else will have to make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| So you've withdrawn your motion as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| So the motion and the substitute are no longer on the table, but there's still discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| So Anders has withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| There's only six standing committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| So why don't we just leave the paperwork the way it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| Because right now the standing committees are cable TV, court, finance, rules, legislative affairs, and solvency board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8140)|
| 2:15:47| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| So let's just go back with what the rules committee originally did, the way it's listed on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8149)|
| 2:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| I just want to point out, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| I just want to point out one thing it does do, and this addressed Commissioner Carringer's remarks directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8161)|
| 2:16:08| It puts a rule in there that says each chairperson's job as the chair of that committee is to submit a report by August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8168)|
| 2:16:16| So it's putting some teeth into the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| Right now, not only does it not say you have to meet at all, it doesn't say you have to do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| and it provides no continuing education for future commissioners or people not on those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| So the purpose of this is to say we'd like for each committee to, by rule, meet once a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8189)|
| 2:16:37| and it's saying the chairperson of that committee is to submit a report so that we all have knowledge of what that committee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8197)|
| 2:16:46| That is the purpose of the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| And so I'd like to make a motion to adopt as presented with meeting one time at least, well, it could be one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8209)|
| 2:17:00| Yeah, I would just propose I'd like to make a motion to approve as written, originally written, Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8220)|
| 2:17:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| Allotted seconds on that one, but I'm going to give that one to Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| So we've got the motion for approval from Commissioner Jay with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| Now, we still have a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| Commissioner Skinmaker for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| Commissioner Anders for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8243)|
| 2:17:24| Sure, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| All in favor for this motion, which is probably before us, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| The next item is Item 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| This is a resolution approving a contract with Claris, Tennessee LLC doing business with Claris Global Alliance to provide real property value and dispute resolution services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8268)|
| 2:17:58| This is Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| We have a motion for approval by Commissioner Biggs with a second by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| I might reference this as talked about at the Finance Committee earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8296)|
| 2:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8299)|
| 2:18:20| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| The next item is Item 46, consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8301)|
| 2:18:29| amending the Knox County Code, Chapter 58, Article 1, Section 58-1, Motor Vehicle Registration Fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8309)|
| 2:18:36| by adding a provision to waive the vehicle registration tax for active volunteer firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated Subsection 55-4-224A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| This is Ordinance No. 0-03-5-101, Subsection 1-7, adopted June 23, 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8327)|
| 2:18:58| Ordinance No. 0-04-5-101A, Subsection 1-6, adopted June 28, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8338)|
| 2:19:07| And Ordinance 0-09-2-101, adopted March 23, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8347)|
| 2:19:14| I'm first reading 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| This is the one I'm sorry, earlier in the meeting, I actually was looking at this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| This is a first reading, requires a two-third vote, so I'd like to do this one as a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| Sent without recommendation, doesn't matter what we vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| That's the proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| Commissioner Anders sent forward with no recommendation, with a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| Commissioner Daley, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| Yeah, I'd just like to clear up one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| Last month we had talked about this is the Knox County Wheel Tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8384)|
| 2:19:50| State of Tennessee has already forgiven their portion, the $24, I believe, whatever that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| So, this is the Knox County Wheel Tax portion less than the $2.50 fee that the Knox County clerk gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8395)|
| 2:20:02| Chief Frazier says he has about 91 thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| And Seymour Volunteer Fire has 10 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| So, that's about a $3,500 physical note to Knox County, which is not much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| Just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| So, the motion on the floor is to send this forward with no recommendation to next week's meeting for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| You've got a line out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| Sorry, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8427)|
| 2:20:28| I'm moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| The way I read the ordinance, it doesn't say anything about Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| But Rescue Squad doesn't get a firefighter tag, they get an E tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| Are they going to come into problems at the clerk's office with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| That's the question we need to answer before next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| I forget the gentleman's name in the clerk's office, and I will have Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8445)|
| 2:20:52| Michael gave me a list of approved organizations, and that will be updated by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8452)|
| 2:21:03| And they will be listed under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| And it's up to the chiefs to make sure that they are following the restrictions and the guidelines by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8466)|
| 2:21:14| So, Chief Frazier and Chief Flenson-Bigler will be putting their name on the line when they sign off that certain person has met these requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8474)|
| 2:21:24| And it's their responsibility, and it's their honor at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| So, that's how that will be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| So, I will make sure we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| Brad, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| They're going to get an E tag, they're not going to get an F tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| So, we've got to make sure that in the ordinance both of them are included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| If that's the desire of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| Okay, we've got Commissioner Smith and Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| I'm not sure which light came on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| Go ahead, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| So, how did the state classify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| Did they do E tags, I mean, you know, for the emergency or volunteer fire department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| How did the state statute classify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| I would have to look and see, Commissioner, but I'm sure there is a volunteer firefighters tag itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8524)|
| 2:22:10| And I thought I'd seen rescue squad tags out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| There are S tags, but they're not firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| And so, this 55-4224 only applies to firefighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8537)|
| 2:22:25| And rescue squad is not, they're under a different classification, which I'm for putting them in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8545)|
| 2:22:31| but if they're volunteer and they're, you know, met the requirements of the one year and they get one vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8551)|
| 2:22:39| but what you've based this ordinance on is 55-4224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| It says nothing about anything but volunteer firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| I agree with you, and I brought that question up, and I believe I went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| Mr. Law Director, you can confirm that question was brought forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| and I thought it was for only the volunteer firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| but then I was told last month I know that the rescue squad was part of that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8581)|
| 2:23:08| I think the volunteer firefighter chief came up and brought that before you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8588)|
| 2:23:13| but the statute talks about firefighters, and the ordinance is amending in accordance with the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8593)|
| 2:23:20| So, they very well could be left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| It's up to the chief to determine and define who the firefighters are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| and that's where he's putting his name on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Well, but Chief Frazier can't, he can only do his rescue squad volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| He can't do either one, and that's the only, you know, Seymour's the only volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| Carnes has a few volunteers, but there are not very many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8621)|
| 2:23:45| We'll look into it and get you some clarity before next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8625)|
| 2:23:52| Right, because, I mean, if the state says you can do this, you can't add this to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8632)|
| 2:23:57| and that's what I want to make sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| Well, another point of clarification, Mr. Law Director, as you go in, this law says paid and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8640)|
| 2:24:09| let's see, an owner or leasee of a motor vehicle who is a resident of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| who is a member of a volunteer fire department or full-time firefighting unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| and another bona fide firefighter, including paid on-call volunteer firefighter or bona fide firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| So, it could actually, if you're doing it based on the law, it's for paid and unpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| So, we need clarification on what we're going to get done, and if you want to do it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| But right now, you've got every, if you're doing it based on the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| you've got every firefighter, paid and unpaid, and you're eliminating rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8677)|
| 2:24:44| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| My question is how does verification work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8688)|
| 2:24:50| Are these chiefs going to put out a list every month to our clerks to let them know who is current and eligible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8690)|
| 2:24:58| Or if somebody gets one, are they going to be able to come back every year and get it without any verification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8698)|
| 2:25:05| The answer to that was yes, because Chief Lissabigler had his list here last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| but we'll invite Chief Frazier and Chief Lissabigler here next week to answer all these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8709)|
| 2:25:17| And the law department can clarify if it's volunteer firefighters only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| or if it's a paid fire department that has a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| So, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8725)|

| 2:28:58| I just had one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| Last year, prior to this meeting, we got together and we talked about all the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| We talked about the purpose of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| We talked about the, you know, are we doing that again or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| I don't plan on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8951)|
| 2:29:12| I mean, last year we also had a whole lot of newer commissioners on it and I think by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| right now, I think that the learning curve, at least on that, would be a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| So maybe every other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8960)|
| 2:29:21| Yeah, probably every time we have a new body, that would make sense to have that type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8961)|
| 2:29:25| learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8965)|
