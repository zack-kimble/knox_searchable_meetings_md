| 2:26:21| That is so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8781)|
| 2:26:22| And, Council, we have one person signed up for public forum, Mr. Umoja Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8782)|
| 2:26:28| Thank you for being here and for staying with us this long, and I think you know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| I'll set the timer here and state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| Umoja Abdul-Ahad, 614 West Hill Avenue, and I won't hold you very long at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8797)|
| 2:26:42| I want to thank the Council members who voted on our 202 funds for our Zero Waste Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8802)|
| 2:26:49| activity, which is a youth aluminum can recycling company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| There are five schools in the Zero Waste Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| The Zero Waste Neighborhood, as we define it, is an area where human development, economic sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8816)|
| 2:27:05| and environmental stewardship work hand in hand, and also where no life is wasted in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| The Zero Waste Neighborhood that Project 2000 has designated is Harriet Tubman and Martin Luther King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8831)|
| 2:27:17| to the east, no, to the west, Castle and Martin Luther King to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8837)|
| 2:27:23| It's 12 blocks east and west, Brooks Road to the south, and also Fifth Avenue to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8843)|
| 2:27:32| And we want to educate the citizens about the value, responsibility, and economics of recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8852)|
| 2:27:38| The five schools in the Zero Waste Neighborhood have already bought into the idea of getting five young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8858)|
| 2:27:44| from each of these schools to teach them how to write a business plan, own, operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| and manage a youth aluminum can recycling company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| One of the things about Knoxville is you have a lot of visionaries in the town, as you very well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8872)|
| 2:27:57| Damaris spoke earlier about the Zero, but the Zoodoo activity, she and I worked on that 25 years ago now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8877)|
| 2:28:03| so it's good to see it coming to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| There's a little slug in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| Quite a bit of Zoodoo piled up in the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8888)|
| 2:28:13| We had some of that here tonight, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| But we are really excited about what's happening in the city, the sustainability award that was given tonight to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8895)|
| 2:28:22| We talked on and on and on about making Knoxville the recycle capital of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| and when we talk about it, sometimes people look at that in amazement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| but there's no place that I know has that designation and why not our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| So thank you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| We will be coming back again to share information about how it's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| and God willing, the next time we come, we'll bring the kids here so they can actually tell you about what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8920)|
| 2:28:45| Well, if you do, we'll move you up to closer in the meeting so the kids don't have to be here this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| Council, there being no further ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| I've got one comment, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| Oh, I'm sorry, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| I hate to add to the time, but I want to thank Mojo for the many years that he's devoted to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8937)|
| 2:29:05| He's worked long and hard, and the area that he just mentioned is all in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| So I just want to thank him for his great work that he's done over many years working on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| He even got his recycling shirt on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| We have a great town, so great things happen in great towns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8963)|
