| 0:09:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Are we agreed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| I believe the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Ms. Wilson, what order do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| What is the who's the first speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Ms. Casey Self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Casey Self, if you could please come to the microphone and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=597)|
| 0:10:06| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| My name is Casey Self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| I live at 5416 Cedar Heights Road, Knoxville 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| I'm speaking today on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| I serve on the League's Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| Our President, Jamie Dobbs, is in Nashville and asked me to speak on her behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| The League of Women Voters has watched closely over the years it has taken to create the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| and we commend the task force for conducting an open and inclusive dialogue while formulating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| We also commend counsel and commission for the care and attention given to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| both separately and in these historic joint sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| You have done due diligence in consideration of this plan, and it is time to approve it and move on to the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| The League has conducted its own study of local land use issues and has adopted a position statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| We feel the Hillside Plan is consistent with our policy, so we support the plan as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| At the previous joint session, Commissioner Norman offered revisions to clearing and density limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| These revisions are a reasonable compromise in light of concerns raised during your deliberations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| and the League supports the amended version of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| In contrast to this reasonable compromise, the Chamber has offered a radically rewritten plan that weakens protections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| eliminates incentives, and fundamentally alters the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| By proposing drastic changes this late in the process, the Chamber insults the task force, the governing bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| and all citizens who have participated up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| That is sufficient reason for you to dismiss their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| Examining the proposal's contents raises additional concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Not only do they propose significant weakening of clearing and density limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| they give the city and county engineering departments authority to disregard the limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| It is the Metropolitan Planning Commission, not the engineering departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| that has the staff and expertise needed to make such decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| As has been noted by all sides, the engineering departments are already overworked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| and understaffed in their enforcement responsibilities, so giving them new planning duties makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| Engineering departments are headed by political appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| so implementation and interpretation of these powers would change when administrations change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| bringing uncertainty and inconsistency into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| When power to grant exceptions to the law is given to political appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| it opens the door for favoritism and corruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| Note also that City Council and County Commission are currently the final arbiters on planning decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| so a shift in the power to the engineering departments is an erosion of your own powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| The League of Women Voters requests that you reject the Chamber's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| and instead support the existing plan with the amendments suggested by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Robin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| Is there a Robin Hill who signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Okay, we'll move to the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| Dan Jerrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=806)|
| 0:13:39| Give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| It's 4-50, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| My name is Dan Jerrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| I live at 2101 Johns River Highway, PO Box 20084, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| I've been following this issue since late last year when the Metropolitan Planning Commission rolled this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| And, basically, it was the first time I had heard about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| It's been going on for two years, and I don't believe that the property owners have been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=847)|
| 0:14:16| I guess it was noted in this plan that this plan would not prevent water towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| electricity transmission towers, tree harvesting, or protected farming practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| What this plan does is to create more government rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| and regulation that will only apply to a fraction of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| and county property owners who were never notified of this change in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| What strikes me is the things that, you know, that the plan does not address at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| And I would like to know the following information if I were sitting where you are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| It's my opinion that these bodies should have requested this in the form of a report and not a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| because that is what you got was just a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| but there are no supporting documents or evidence to support that this plan will do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| but add more layers of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| The questions that I have for this body, and maybe you should be asking the questions too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| from a legal perspective, the city and county attorneys have stated that the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| should it be approved, will pass muster with the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| A legal analysis prepared by the Chamber of Commerce identified four defects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| which may open the city and county to legal challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| They are the MPC plan exceeds the scope of an amendment to the general regional plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| permitted by statute which authorizes adoption of a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| The MPC plan was not adopted in the manner required by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| The terms of the MPC plan are not sufficiently certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| and definite to satisfy constitutional requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| and the process used for adoption of the MPC plan did not provide the constitutionally required due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| noted to the affected property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| I would add that the supposed public participation through the task force was merely a farce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| The task force may have held meetings over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| but was disbanded and the plan was written by the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| and therefore the comments of the public who were in attending of the task force meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| were deprived of their opportunity to inform the people who wrote the plan of their objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| Regardless of the perceived merits of the Chamber's legal analysis, anyone can sue anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| And my question to this body is, after being informed of these potential risks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| do you have a duty and a responsibility to mitigate the potential risk and litigation through appropriate action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| Are you as our representatives responsible to perform risk analysis of a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:54| and in doing so protect citizens from litigation to the city or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| You might have been informed of the alleged legal defect of failure to notify the affected property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| Would you consider it a fiduciary responsibility to inform those individuals for the finite cost of $17,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| rather than to fight through a legal battle on that point, which is an unknown number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| Do you feel that you have a responsibility to protect everyone's property rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| Are you willing to commit the resources of your city and county governments to defend the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| Are you willing to commit taxpayer dollars should a suit be filed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| Are you willing the long-term, what will be the long-term potential costs of the litigation estimated to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:48| if somebody should bring a suit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| What are the common features of the process of this plan and the 10-year plan that ended so badly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| I've heard all the technical discussions regarding slope and density and easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| What offends me is the attitude that this body has about the property rights of these individual owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| Beyond that, what I haven't heard discussed is the extreme slope of 50 percent is basically unusable land in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| Forty-five seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| Will all the people have their taxes rolled back to zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| Will my property, which may be affected, if it has one house per acre to one house per two acres, have a 50 percent reduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:30| These are the sort of things that are not, have not been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| And I believe that if you were discussed, if these had been reported to you in depth, that we would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| this would have taken a whole different turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1122)|

| 0:18:52| That's Axel Ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| It's 456.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| Thank you, Commissioner Norman, for that correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| My name is Axel Ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Actually, I am a resident of Jefferson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| but I am the conservation chair of the Harvey Broom Group of the Sierra Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| and I am representing our approximately 1,000 members that reside in Knox County and Knox City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:27| You council members and county commissioners represent approximately 423,000 people living in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:42| I would hope that you take into consideration all of those people's rights and interests rather than the interests of some special interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:57| who have a direct financial interest in how this plan either becomes accepted or does not become accepted or becomes modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:12| I am not going to go into any details about the plan that has been presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| You know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| At least I hope you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| You have had ample time to read through it, to discuss it, to analyze it, to debate its merits and its flaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1221)|
| 0:20:32| You also know that this is not a takings issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| This is not about private property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| This is about a vision for the city and the county and about protecting the land and about protecting the people that live on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:52| The plan B that was presented to you by the Chamber of Commerce that was presented at the end of last week at the 11th hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1252)|
| 0:21:05| or I should say at the 11th hour and 59th minute, cuts the protected area in half right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:19| I have not had time or the opportunity to actually read through that plan and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| but the short glance that I had at it this afternoon, which was the first time I had a chance to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1287)|
| 0:21:36| indicates to me that its primary purpose is to preserve the profits of the business and developer community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:47| It does not serve to protect the interests of the people and the land in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1307)|
| 0:21:59| A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to drive through a portion of western North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| As you know, that's a fairly mountainous area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| It struck me as I was driving down Route 74 and I was going up an 8% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| Now keep in mind that the hillside and ridgetop protection plan only kicks in at 15% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| At that 8% grade, my car had to gear down to try to maintain speed going up it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:33| That was one hell of a steeper slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| That's steeper than the Federal Highway Administration allows for federal highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| and yet the chamber and the developer community wants to let anything up to 30% be unregulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:53| I submit to you that on behalf of the 423,000 and some odd people that you support and vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1373)|
| 0:23:09| and achieve a consensus for the hillside and ridgetop protection plan as modified by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Renee Hoyos, if you could give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| It's 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| My name is Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| I'm the Executive Director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Our address is 625 Market Street, 8th Floor, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Creating the chambers plan B makes me sad, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| It feels like a mean-spirited attempt to overturn a process that the chamber actually participated in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| There were well over 100 meetings to create the original plan, along with several public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| Why is it that we're hearing these concerns from the chamber now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| They had plenty of opportunity to introduce these ideas during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| I ask the County Commission and City Council to dismiss this plan because it's ill-conceived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| TCWN opposes the 100 percent clearing of slopes up to a 30 percent grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| In our experience, developers can hardly keep their sites contained on far less steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| We know that a 30 percent slope will not be adequately protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| Furthermore, according to the maps the chamber provided in Plan B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| there will be 100 percent clearing of all of our steepest slopes except for their very tippy tops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| TCWN opposes office and commercial development above a 15 percent grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| and is on the record stating that position from the last round of hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| The new plan appears to allow office and commercial development up to 50 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| and above 50 percent if the proper paperwork is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| In our experience, what is on paper and what gets built may be two entirely different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| Often the built project is the worst project and once it's built, it will never be taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| The density definition appears to apply only to residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| Office and commercial development are required to meet the development standards set forth in Plan B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| but with no density definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| Is the chamber suggesting that office and commercial development have no limits on steep slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| This plan will open a Pandora's box for poor development on steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| visible to all and far less charming than a water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| It will open the door for more private property damage of downstream downslope property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| While TCWN respects private property rights, landowners do not have the right to harm their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| Developing on steep slopes has the potential for downstream property damage due to slope slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| as we have seen in recent months during severe storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Please do not move forward on the chamber's Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Casey Self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1566)|
| 0:26:17| I'll sign that twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| David Vandergriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:29| David Vandergriff, 400 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| I've spoken to this body several times in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| and I wish to speak this time about one specific aspect of this whole plan and revised Plan B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:47| and that is speaking from the viewpoint of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Trees have real utility value, ecological utility value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| and that value has just been quantified for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| in a recently completed urban forestry management plan using I-Tree Streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| I-Tree Streets is a program that's developed by the U.S. Forest Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| that's used across the country to quantify ecological benefits of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| Plan B allows for 100 percent clearing and removal of these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| To put this in terms of real terms from real neighborhoods throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| the annual benefit per tree ranges from $123 down to $44 at the low end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:43| Of that total benefit per tree, stormwater benefits account for a range of $44 down to $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| The ecological benefits come from large trees, not from small trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| So if you remove all the large trees and simply plant some small trees, these ecological benefits aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| This is real dollar value to the city of Knoxville and to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| that would be lost whenever you clear 100 percent of the site to allow for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| So I hope that you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| I know City Council will be presenting this entire plan here in the next couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| and I hope those of you from County Commission will attend the meetings where this information is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| so you can learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1715)|

| 0:28:57| I'm the president of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| And at the April meeting of the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| a representative from each of the following 23 neighborhoods voted unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| to support the existing proposal for the hillside and ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| Those neighborhoods were Ashley Oaks, Belmont West, Charlestown Landing, Cobblestone Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| Crestline, Crestwood Hills, Foxfire, Graywood Clusters, Gulf Park, Gulfwood, Highgate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1761)|

| 0:29:37| New Kensington, North Shore Landing, Sherman Oaks, Tanrera West, View Harbor, Wayne Province,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| and the woods at Bluegrass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Since that time, in almost each meeting, monthly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| we have discussed the hillside and ridgetop plan to some degree or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| and three more neighborhoods have voted to support the plan as it was actually written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| before even amendments were added by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| The three that have since voted since April to support the plan are Statesview, Farrington, and Seven Oaks East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1805)|
| 0:30:17| The position of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners is that the people who own property adjacent to steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| hillsides and ridgetops are the ones who should be considered most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| That they have a right to not have their property flooded by runoff and to not have their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:40| particularly those that are downslope, devalued when steep slopes behind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| or beside them are stripped of trees with little regard for how it will affect their privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| I don't have that much to say today except to ask that you approve this plan with the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| that were added by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| We are not land speculators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| We are current homeowners, taxpayers, and voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| We would like to maintain our property rights today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| and we want to see our tax dollars used for more parks and greenways and better schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| instead of used to clean up floodwaters and to dredge creeks that are choked with muddy runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| Trouble spots like this exist all over the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| and they were caused by either poor land management or made worse because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| There's been a lot said recently about how Knox County needs to attract new industry and jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| and the Council of West Knox County Homeowners completely agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| But we think that to become serious about bringing in new business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| we need to start paying more attention to what makes this area a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1915)|

| 0:32:03| Give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| And it's 505, and you have up to 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| My name is Tom McAdams, 4823 Old Kingston Pike Suite 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| A few years ago, council and commission put together a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| and asked MPC to assist that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| And what they asked them to do was to prepare a study of ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| and hillside protection measures outlining the alternatives for new codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| and programs for conservation of these important natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| The chamber 100 percent supports that concept and that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| That's not what you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| What you got was an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| You got one document, one legal item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| You did not get alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| You did not get codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| You did not get programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| You got a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| We're prepared to support a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| While it's not what you asked for and we don't think it was the right place to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| the chamber is prepared to support a chamber amendment as long as it is reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| and understandable and enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| and it balances the right of the community's interest with the rights of property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| Very straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| We think that a plan must include protection of hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| and lower line property and watersheds from slope failure and erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| It should protect the scenic views, which is what you asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| and what Mr. Donaldson told you at the last meeting, this plan does not address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| So we would add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| We want there to be protection of scenic hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| There should be a reasonable basis for defining the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| It should be clear, concise, and understandable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| and there should be an objective process for reviewing proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| not let's rezone everything to a planned zone and let MPC decide what they can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| The MPC preface, the preface to the plan says that's what they propose to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| to implement this primarily through planned zoning and use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| These are technical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Erosion requires engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| It should require detailed submissions of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| and technical review by professionals in the field, and we support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| We're in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| We're in favor of tightening it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| We're in favor of stopping any erosion that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| But we're in favor of doing it in accordance with a clear, concise, legal plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| The plan that MPC prepared has a wealth of information in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| and many good concepts, some of which have been adopted in Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| We don't disagree with a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| What we do disagree with is jumbling it together with background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| with here's what's going on in Asheville, with here are some best practices from other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| and we pick it up and we read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| And the law says this is legally enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| You must follow this when you make land planning decisions in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| What does it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| That's the problem with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| The Chamber and other members of the business community have had people who have been involved in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| from the beginning for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Several of them were on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| They feel they were ignored, and several of them resigned from the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| because they did not feel that MPC was paying attention to their opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| and experience in connection with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| That's fine, but it's not like this was ignored for the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| We also continue to follow the progress of the plan, hoping it would evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| hoping it would be amended to more clearly address some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| And as far as I know, the revisions proposed by Mr. Norman and Mr. Donaldson at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| were the first time we've heard any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| And those revisions are not in a legal posture that you can vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| For you to be able to vote on those, they have to go back to MPC and then come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| So that's the position that we find ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| And so since there did not appear to be any progress in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| the chamber has had an advisory committee for months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| and it asked the advisory committee to draft a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| The advisory committee consisted of Gary Norvell of Betzenheim, Norvell & Poe, engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| Gary has over 40 years or about 40 years of experience as a professional engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| involved in hundreds of developments and was a member of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| It includes Chris Uten and the Shod Companies, a major property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| a major developer in this county involved in many, many, many projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| and a strong supporter of conservation and protection of hillsides and ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| It includes me and our firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| It includes Robin Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| And it includes multiple members of the chamber staff, including Mike Edwards, Garrett Wagley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| Doug Lawyer, who have degrees in the members of the committee have degrees in forestry, in land planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| as well as lots of experience in regulatory matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| So that's who wrote Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| There's no secret about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| We think Plan B is superior to the MPC plan in many regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| It includes specific standards for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| It includes a process for engineering review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| It includes the same protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| It adds scenic ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| It is tighter than the MPC plan in many regards and actually strengthens the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| We recommend that the county consider requiring permits for any land disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| and get rid of the one acre exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| We think slopes should be based on three acres, not five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| So we think it should apply to even smaller sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| There are other areas where it actually tightens up the requirements that were in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| So these were not casually thought of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| What we think MPC did was overreach when it started defining the protected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2271)|
| 0:38:00| When you look at how things have evolved historically, Knoxville has not been destroyed by developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| In fact, Knoxville was founded by developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I was interested in the reference to land speculators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| When you read the history of Knox County, it says land speculators bought this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| and the first ones laid out the city of Knoxville 225 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| And where did they lay it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| They laid it out on a ridgetop, and the Primo Riverfront lots are on the steepest hillside in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| That's the history of development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| It's hillsides and ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| That's what developed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Black Oak Ridge, Holston Hills, Lions View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| The ridges, the hilltops are what developed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| That's where people wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Downtown is built on a ridgetop over a steep hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| And these areas have not destroyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| When you look at the cover of Plan B, you look at the beautiful hillsides and ridgetops that everyone agrees we should protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| They haven't been massively damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| There are no proposals in 225 years to clear these hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| No one is after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| This isn't an effort to destroy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| It's an effort to protect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| We'd like to very quickly go through a few slides that show you how much MPC proposes to expand the already existing protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:17| The first slide shows this is what's in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| The general plan for many, many years has identified this as the slopes and ridgetops, if you'll back up to that first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| These were going a little fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| Can we get some of the lights cut off on this section up here where that will show up a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| This is what has been included in the general plan for many years as the hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| and slopes in Knox County that needed protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| If you look at that map and you look at this map on the wall that's been here since this building was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| you'll find the areas are amazingly similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| These are the areas that are generally considered the steepest hillsides, the most prominent hillsides in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:06| The next slide shows you these are the highest ridges in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| including ridges over 1,200 feet north of the Tennessee and French Broad Rivers and south over 1,100 feet south of the rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:23| When you're looking at protecting ridges and protecting scenic vistas, a lot of them you can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| You can only see them if they have topographic prominence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| And the next slide shows you how topographic prominence works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| that if you're beside a hill and there are other hills that are lower that are behind it and higher ones behind that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| not all of that is visible and not all of that needs to be in a special protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| So the next slide shows you what Plan B proposes, which is you take the highest ridge tops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| and you take the major arterial roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| And if you can see one of these major or can see one of these ridges over these elevations from a major arterial road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| then that ought to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| And the chamber proposes to protect those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| The MPC plan includes no scenic protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| It includes erosion control and grading and so on, but no other protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| The chamber plan does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| The next slide shows you the comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| Well, this is the current general plan, and the next slide is the MPC proposed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| So this is the area that MPC now proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| You see how much larger the green area was than it was on the previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| The next slide superimposes the old protection area over the new protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| So the new protection area has grown by the amount of the green that you see on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| It has grown to over 39 percent of Knox County suddenly needs special protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| So this is what we say when we say it has become unreasonable in scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| The next slide shows the chamber's proposed hillside protection area under Plan B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| and the next slide shows that compared to the existing general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| very similar to what's been recognized for many years as the critical hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| and ridgetop plans, Plan B actually stronger and including a larger area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| The next slide compares Plan B and what the MPC plan proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| As you can see, Plan B is less than 10 percent of the county, about 9 percent of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| and the MPC plan is almost 40 percent of the county put in a special protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| This just shows you all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| So what we would urge you to do is to not get caught up in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| but instead to adopt the best plan that provides the best protection that's understandable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| and legally enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| I'd ask Gary Norvell, who's an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| to quickly review with you the difference in a 15 percent slope and a 20 percent slope and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| so you have a little better example of how development has gone on here for the last 225 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| Gary Norvell with Batson Homes, Norvell & Poe Engineers in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| and Norvell & Poe Engineers in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| As Tom said, I've had right at 40 years of experience now working in the development community in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| and also the last 12 to 13 years in Sevier County dealing with a different kind of terrain up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| In looking at the chamber plan as we went through this, we did, as Tom said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| we tried to break out into two phases, the ridge top part and the hillside part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| because we feel like those are two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| They're not one issue in the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| They're two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| The chamber plan is, in the way it is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| is something that can be implemented from an engineering standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| and that's because it's more of an objective plan than a subjective plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| As far as the slopes, 15 to 30 percent is not a slope that's unworkable, and we recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2659)|
| 0:44:28| I've seen that in the 40 years almost that I've been doing this and dealing with different slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:37| We've dealt with 30 percent slopes, 20 to 30 percent slopes the entire time, and those are workable slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:46| Once you get over 30 percent, and a lot of it depends on the situation that you're in, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| how much of it it is and how it's located on a particular site as to how you work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| But certainly there are conditions where maybe something 25 is you've got a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| but you have to look at everything on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| But certainly a 30 percent number makes more sense than a 15 percent, because 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| and if you all can see this thing here that the chamber has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| it gives you an idea about what those slopes actually look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| I'll let them set that up and go ahead and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| Tom's talked about the areas that we had on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| And we, as I said, we feel like that a 30 percent slope is a more important slope at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| than you're getting to position into a situation where you have to be more concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| about erosion set of control and stormwater measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| This was the first one being 15 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| The middle one is a 30 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| And then this is a 50 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| In regard to the ridge top, as Tom said, we've got in this plan we actually do have a defined area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| that would be designated as through an overlay process as a ridge top for ridge top protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:23| And it has been decided based on the prominence as far as visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| Go ahead and wrap it up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| I've just got a few more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| Ms. Wilson, how much time does he have left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Thirty-six seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Thirty-six seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| The first one is Getty's View, which is an existing, all these are existing developments in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| In that particular subdivision, the average slope of the subdivision is 21 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| but there are slopes in it that are up to 39 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| North Shore Town Center, the average slope there is 19 percent, but there's areas of it that are at 29 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:16| Whittington Creek has areas of a maximum slope of up to 31 percent with a 15 percent average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:24| Ayers Hall is on a 30 percent slope average with some maximum slopes of 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| No Wood, which is on Bearden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| I need you to, unless somebody wants to give him some additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| I'm sorry, sir, your time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| I'd like to see him finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| If you could go ahead and wrap it up and continue, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Yeah, just a few more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| As I said, No Wood has an average of 16 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Nobody can argue with the appearance of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| It has a 29 percent maximum slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| The HOPE-4 or HOPE-6 development on Knoxville College, it has an average slope of 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:07| and that's at a three-and-a-half D dwellings per acre density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| It has maximum slopes of up to 80 percent and one short area up to 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| And, of course, the city-county building where we are now, the maximum slope of it is 22 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| So I think these are examples that are very good to show that working up to 30 percent is a very workable slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:33| But once you get over that, then you have to start looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| Next speaker is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| If you could come to the podium, please, and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| It's 525.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| My name is Lisa Starbuck, and my address is 6229 Babaly Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| I'm here before you today in three different roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| First, as a property owner of about a dozen acres of undeveloped land in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| which would fall inside the hillside and protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| I support the plan, and I do not believe that the hillside plan will devalue my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| But instead, I believe it will enhance the value as well as protect my neighbor's property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:35| In my role as a member of the task force that developed this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| I'd like you to know that in my professional life, I am a computer consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| Every hour that I spend on civic activities is actual money out of my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| As a citizen who has been asked to serve on several different task forces, including the hillside task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| I have spent hundreds of hours of uncompensated time over the last three years working on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:11| The task force was very careful to consider all the angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| We had engineers, developers, and many experts, both governmental and non-governmental, to help us work on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:25| I do not believe that anyone was not heard, and I attended all of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| We also visited other cities and looked at their plans for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| In none of the other cities who implemented this type of plan was there any evidence that the plan devalued any property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| or reduced the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| In fact, it was the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Instead of re-admitting the wheel, we looked at what was working elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| and how it could be adapted to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| I am somewhat resentful that a powerful entity such as the chamber did not participate in the many months of public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3057)|
| 0:51:05| and dozens of opportunities to make their voices heard until the very last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| They chose instead to derail this process at the very end by throwing rocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| misrepresenting a lot of the things in the plan and presenting an alternative plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:27| I'm not going to address the specifics of their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| I have read it, except to say that it didn't have any input, obviously, from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:41| other than a small group of people in the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| I think one of the most troubling aspects of it is that it proposes to take away MPC's job of evaluating proposed developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3106)|
| 0:52:00| and put that on the hands of the already overworked engineering departments of both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| And lastly, I'd like to speak as a neighborhood representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| I am the president of NEPA Neighborhood Organization and the vice president of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| and I'm on the board of several other organizations, all of which are supporting this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:30| The neighborhoods, as you well know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| and a lot of your most contentious issues that come before council and commission are zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| And a lot of times the zoning issues that cause these contentious meetings are oftentimes to do with density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:53| And so the neighborhoods agreed to offer the developers a carrot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3173)|
| 0:53:03| in that one of the things that the plan proposed was a density bonus so that if the developer did the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:14| that they would be able to make more money by increasing the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| And so that's a pretty big concession for neighborhoods to make to agree to allow higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| if the developer can show that they're developing the property in such a way that it won't negatively impact everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| And, you know, I really, in that same spirit, I don't see anybody on the other side doing that same kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| Anyway, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| We don't have anyone else signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Commissioner Broyles, is that your light or your daughter's light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| Actually, it was my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| I had a question for the gentleman from the chamber who were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| and I had turned my light on and didn't get recognized and left it on in the hope that somebody would see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| So is it okay for me to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Now is the time for questions, comments by the commissioners and the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| As for the chamber's plan, I still, you know, I've read through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:32| but it's going to be impossible for me to give it any serious consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:40| until I know exactly who worked on it and what their affiliations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| You gave me a few names and then said, and, you know, a group of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| So I can't tell by that how diverse the group was, who they represented, or what their interests are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| So I would really prefer to have you all send us a list of exactly who worked on this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| and exactly what their affiliations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| As to how Knoxville and Knox County developed a couple hundred years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| of course it developed on the ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| You know, but today we don't have to be quite as concerned about an indigenous tribe coming to take our scalps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:32| I don't think that, you know, anyone, these towns were frontier towns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| and anybody who knows anything about military tactics knows you get there first with the most men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| and you get the highest grant you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| And that was how a lot of these frontier towns were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| But that's not what's going on now a couple hundred years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| We have different priorities than they did then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| And I understand that you all have had a little fun poked at you this week because of the name of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| I'm guessing that you all didn't realize that Plan B was the name of an emergency contraceptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| But I know that that has also been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| We weren't fully aware that we considered this an emergency contraceptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:22| I suggest that you might want to do a little research because I know you got some fun poked at you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| So I am delighted to know that you all realized what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| But honestly, I don't see how any of us can give this any serious consideration unless we do know exactly who worked on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:45| exactly where it came from, and what their affiliations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| And if you don't have time right now to go down the whole list, then you can certainly just e-mail that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| But I can't give this any serious consideration without answers to those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3414)|
| 0:57:03| We will be happy to e-mail that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| I did list everyone who was directly involved in the drafting of the plan in my earlier remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| which was Chris Uten of the Schott Company, Gary Norvell of Batson, Himes, Norvell, and Poe, me, Tom McAdams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:20| Bernstein, Steyer, McAdams, attorneys at law, Robin Askew, who is an attorney at law, and then from the chamber staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| Mike Edwards, Garrett Wagley, Laddie Fields, and Doug Lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| And what concerns me about that is that I'm not seeing a lot of diversity in that group in terms of different outlooks on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:44| we should be treating our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| So that's another major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| I think one point about that legally is that Plan B is before you in a manner that you can revise it, you can add to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3474)|
| 0:58:03| you can subtract from it if there are provisions you think should be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| You legally can do that, include it in the plan, and adopt it and send it to MPC for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| You cannot do that with the MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| It can only be voted up or down in its current posture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| You can certainly send it back to MPC with requests for revisions or you can adopt your own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| But with Plan B, you're free to revise it in accordance with comments that you've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:34| in accordance with any comments MPC might make or anything else of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110929hillsideridgetopprotectionpart1?start=3519)|
