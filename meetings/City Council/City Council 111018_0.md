| 0:05:57| who's going to be arriving during public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| and would like to put that special guest on the agenda and that hopefully Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| and the audience will be here when this special guest arrives during public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=365)|

| 0:06:15| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| I'd like to remind folks in the 4th District and even in your district, the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| and elsewhere in the city that the Burlington Branch Library is having a book sale this Saturday, the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| and Monday, the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| It's a good chance to help your local branch raise some money and go out there and buy some books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| or bring some books for them to sell, and we'll all be happier for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=397)|

| 0:06:42| Seeing no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Did we mention Hollerpalooza?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| Well, we should mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| It should be good to be mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| The Happy Holler area that is along Central Avenue has a festival each year, and it's been growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| and they close off the street and they'll have music and food and entertainment and booths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| and you'll be able to meet and talk to people from different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| But it's a good family day type thing to go out there, just visit, see the shops, and enjoy the surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=428)|
| 0:07:17| What's the time on that, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| I wish I knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Mr. Palooza, I believe it's 11 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| 11 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| I'm going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Are there any more comments on anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| I guess I'd just like to mention that we had a great luncheon last Friday, Legacy Parks Luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| a sold-out luncheon at the Bluffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| It was just a gorgeous postcard day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| It couldn't have been any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| The governor was here and celebrated with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| and it's just a tribute more of good work to Carol Evans and Legacy Parks and the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| and all the hard work they do to, you know, promote Knoxville in the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| that you're going to hear a lot about in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| So I just want to recognize that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| It was very successful, and I look forward to, you know, numerous events throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=488)|

| 0:08:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| We have one person that has signed up to speak on that, Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=504)|
| 0:08:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| If you would come down and give us your address and name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| My name is Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I live at 3029 Davenport Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| I speak tonight first to represent the South Knoxville Neighborhood and Business Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| and we support the update to the South Sector Plan and urge you to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| Many of our members participated in the public process that created this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| and agree it's an excellent road map for South Knoxville development for the next 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| We're very surprised that last month at council's meeting when the Knoxville Chamber suddenly requested a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| postponement on this issue, and we were somewhat distressed that council granted that request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| because the chamber did not participate in any of the year-long public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| to create the updated South Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| We ask tonight that you no longer delay this and pass it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| And also I'd like to, just as a citizen of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| I'd like to thank Nick Pavlis and Carol Evans, Legacy Parks Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| for the dedication of the river bus property that Nick mentioned a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| That's a great advancement for South Knoxville, and it will greatly increase tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| and also for the future with recreational opportunities, too, as well as the historical corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=602)|
| 0:10:10| So we're really excited about the future of South Knoxville, and we hope you pass this sector plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| We do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Let me stop and recognize Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I haven't heard any opposition really necessarily to the adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| but in looking at this ridgetop protection process we've gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| if we adopt the South Knoxville South Sector Plan, it will go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| If we make some, if we do any amendments to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| that would affect the South Knoxville South Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| And so it just seemed to me all along that we might as well wait until we finish our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| with the ridgetop protection process, which last Thursday we had another joint session with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| and at the conclusion of the meeting we had a straw poll among council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| and it was unanimously voted on and approved that we would meet once more with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| to see if we could come up with a mutual agreeable plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| one plan that the city and the county could both agree upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| So if we pass this tonight, then if we do anything with the ridgetop plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| we're going to have to come back and amend this anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| So I thought, well, we might as well go ahead and conclude the ridgetop process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| and then, you know, that would be incorporated across the entire general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| So I really don't have any opposition other than to say that it just made more sense for me in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=718)|
| 0:12:06| to finish up the ridgetop process first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| I thought we already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| I thought we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| No, we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| I stopped in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Well, Mayor, you know, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| I mean, we're going to have another meeting with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| and we will see if we can come up with one plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| and then if that occurs, then if it affects the south sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| then we'll have to come back and amend it to reflect according with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| Well, at this point, so the record would be clear, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| I think what happened was the mayor inadvertently called for a vote when the member of the council was asked to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| And so for the record to be clear, I think it would be better to redo this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Now we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=786)|

| 0:14:26| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| I would just like to ask Mr. King if he could be a little bit more detailed in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| what it is that we're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| As you recall, there was some funding made available for this project, and Joe Walsh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| in Recreation hired a landscape architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| Improvements are going to be made for access from Hazen down the hill toward the statue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=889)|
| 0:14:58| and monument area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| There's some accessible parking being created there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| And there's also new tee boxes and, I guess, the actual structure that would be called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=905)|
| 0:15:13| a hole in disc golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| And I don't know if Joe's here or not, but he can explain this much better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| But engineering's role in this is to administer the construction contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| Joe Walsh is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| I don't know if he wants to say anything to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| If you do, I'm going to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=934)|
| 0:15:48| Actually, Mr. King pretty much hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| We are making improvements with the $250,000 that Pilot Oil donated to us last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| And the tee boxes are being concreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| They're currently made out of dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| And 18 new baskets will be added to the disc golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| So those improvements, as well as the walkway down from the statue down to the large picnic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| pavilion in the center of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| And, like Steve said, handicap accessible parking spaces will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| So this is really phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| We also, as part of the design work done by Carroll R. Johnson Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| they basically did a long-term multi-phase plan for improvements at Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| So basically the money for this contract will be used to make those first phase improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| You are referring to the Alex Haley statue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1007)|

| 0:16:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| 7C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Charles Ingalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Trucking, Inc., DBA Ingle Paving for the 2011 sidewalk replacement project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1015)|

| 0:17:07| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| This is another question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| I noticed that you listed where the sidewalks are going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| Can you be specific where on Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| It's in front of the funeral home across from Ben Ashley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1039)|
| 0:17:29| So how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| It's several hundred feet on each side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| On this particular project, as you may recall, we just identify areas that are safety problems or hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1053)|
| 0:17:42| And we log those and prioritize them and put them into a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| What does it look like as far as other sidewalks along Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| I know that the area through Sequoia Hills is pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| So how is it done in terms of determining?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Well, we rate the sidewalks priority one, two, or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| And we keep a database when we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Usually we get a call that some citizen says this sidewalk is a tripping hazard or there's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| We go inspect it and rate it and put it into the database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Humana Insurance Company, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| for the provision of pharmacy benefit management services for eligible city employees enrolled in the city's medical plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| for a period of three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| I just wanted to thank Larry Martin and Mr. Estes and the risk management group for working on a project that looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| it has an opportunity to save the city $1.4 million over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| That's good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| That's the kind of stuff we want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Good initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Thank you for being vigilant and looking at ways to save taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Mr. Martin, you and I have talked today about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| And I had some questions and you had some great answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| So if you could share that, I think everybody would be fairly comfortable with where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| Thank you, Councilmember Palmer, and thank you, Councilmember Della Volpe, for your kind comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| The administration feels very good about this recommendation to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| We think it is consistent with what we have been about for several years now with our medical plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| trying to make it first rate quality-wise and at a reasonable price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| We had hoped for 2012 that we would make minimal changes in our health plan and pretty much have achieved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1184)|
| 0:19:55| But we felt strongly that the pharmaceutical part of our cost was something that we needed to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1195)|
| 0:20:04| It's a sizable percentage of what we and the employees spend in health care each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1204)|
| 0:20:13| And it's a rather complex problem, but we have had good outside help from Cowan, who is our consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1213)|
| 0:20:24| and has been our consultant on health care matters for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| And if the council will remember, in August you approved us amending that contract with Cowan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| that would allow Cowan to engage a consulting firm to advise them and us in regard to putting our request for proposal together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1235)|
| 0:20:44| on pharmaceutical pharmacy management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| And they did that, and we have had the benefit of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| That work will continue even after the contract is adopted as they will provide a monitoring service for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| that will be a good check and balance to make sure we do indeed achieve the savings that are described in the contract before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1261)|
| 0:21:10| So we feel good about that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| And Council Member Palmer and I talked about how we went about coming to this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| And just to share with Council, we did use an evaluation committee made up of a cross-section of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| We tried to get representatives on that evaluation committee that are from some of our larger departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1286)|
| 0:21:35| and have a good feel for the pulse, if you will, of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| And so they were part of an evaluation committee, plus we had a member of the law department as an ex-officio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| and then Gary Eastis, who is manager, as you know, of risk management for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| So that was the group that looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| They relied a good bit on Cowan and the other consulting firm to guide us through what are very complex responses to our request for proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1316)|
| 0:22:07| So the thing that was important to us was to, on behalf of our employees in the city, to try to reduce our pharmaceutical costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1327)|
| 0:22:17| We think this contract achieves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| Also, we wanted to do that with minimal disruption to our employees and changes for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| And for the most part, we've been successful with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| with the exception of the fact that our employees will have to carry a second card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| They have a Blue Cross card today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| That Blue Cross card today can serve in both functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| But once this contract is adopted and for the 2012 year, they will have to use two cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| a separate card, if you will, for the pharmacy part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| So the rest of it, the step therapy, all of those sort of things are pretty much mirror exactly what we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1374)|
| 0:23:06| We will focus on what is different, and that will be covered at length in the open enrollment that will start here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1386)|
| 0:23:16| Alston McGreeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Mr. Martin, I want to thank you all also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| I did have a conversation with Mr. Estes today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| and just want to be sure and confirm that several of the questions that were asked of me is that, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| that all the major drug companies, or not companies, but the drug pharmacies, that we'll still be able to continue to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1409)|
| 0:23:37| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Yeah, we've calculated that at 98.9 percent, and it may be that we'll get to 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| The remaining 1 percent was small, independent pharmacies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| and we haven't been able to verify if they're covered, but roughly 99 percent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| And also the drugs that people are presently taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| No change in that whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| I believe we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| I didn't think we had a motion, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Granger County Sheriff's Office, Granger, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| for the transfer of surplus city equipment for a total price of $14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| I'm going to vote in favor of this, but I wanted to mention to Mr. Evans a little more care in the information sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| It says all the vehicles have in excess of 80,000 miles, and that's not correct according to the table in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| Some of them have lesser mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| You have explained to us in the past that sometimes these police cruisers get heavy use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| and wear out faster than normal cars, but the information was not correct on the cover page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| So please try to proof that stuff a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| The only other comment is that most of us have seen poor Granger County on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| driving cars with 300,000 miles on them and stuff, so I'm glad that you found an opportunity to get some vehicles to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| I'm sure it will help that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| I believe we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| We have a resolution authorizing the mayor to file a grant application with the U.S. Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| and State of Tennessee to provide funding to Knoxville Area Transit for congestion mitigation air quality grant assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| for the purchase of buses and related equipment in the amount of $3,600,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| and authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents to accept such a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| I want to ask the question of, I guess, Ms. McGinnis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| How many buses are we talking about on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Approximately six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Six buses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| We're thinking three trolleys and three 40-foot regular transit buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| A lot of it depends on the pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| It's been moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to submit a grant application together with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| and the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club to the State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| for grant assistance in the amount of $75,000 for the purchase of a Suico trail dozer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| to be split between the three agency applicants and certain in-kind services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| and authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents to accept such grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Councilman Della Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I just wanted to thank Joe Walsh and his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| This is moving in the right direction to be able to start making our own trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| and doing things more efficiently in-house instead of always letting these things out for bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| So this dozer is going to help you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| It says both build and maintain trails, and I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| It's been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| And Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I'd like to echo that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| And with the Friday afternoon Legacy Parks Foundation luncheon and the pedestrian bridge, bicycle bridge workshop we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1646)|
| 0:27:39| all of this can be a really big deal for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| The mountain biking and the connectivity between all our greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| and the urban wilderness over in south Knoxville is really pretty remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| And I think this is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| And anything we can be doing to promote it is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| And certainly it's going to help with obesity and all of that type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| And that's a major problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| So it's been moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Well, I probably need to dovetail off all those comments since, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| Councilwoman Palmer said this sounds more like the Pavlis resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| But, you know, it is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| It seems like there's not a meeting goes by that we're not talking about the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| and the trails and all the positive things that are happening in south Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| and that, you know, hopefully will extend throughout all of Knoxville with the connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| with the trails and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| But this is just one more thing, just one more investment to help us move forward in south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| move the urban wilderness forward and just make Knoxville not only for what you mentioned on obesity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| but make us a regional attraction and to bring, to put, you know, heads in beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| and make us that coupled with Iams and the Civil War forts is really going to put us on the map even that much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| So this is just another step in investment in our future in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1741)|

| 0:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| My name is Vincent Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| It's spelled, excuse me, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| It's spelled A-N-A-S-T-A-S-I-O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| It's Italian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| I come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| I come here to discuss about getting walk signals on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| and Kingston Pike and Willow Springs, also Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| The reasons are, the facts are, two people were killed, one on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| Fact two, one was killed on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Fact three is that a lot of people take city transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| and there are no crosswalks signals, you know, crosswalk signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| And the question I have for the city council is how many more have to die on city streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| I mean, that's the question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| I mean, because my whole theory is this, is that you have to wait for a traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1955)|
| 0:32:44| And a lot of people are in wheelchairs, okay, that take city buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| And also, once that light turns, you either got to run like crazy across the street to just get across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1969)|
| 0:32:59| or you're risking your life right here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| Also, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to know if there could be a stop sign on Broadway, between Broadway and Old Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1983)|
| 0:33:12| because there's a shopping center right on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| We have a Party City, Cici's Pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| It's between Tazeville Pike and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| And there's not a stop sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| There's one on Old Broadway, but there's not a stop sign there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| We'll back with traffic engineering, see what we can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| And I'd like to thank this city council for listening to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| and my concerns as a citizen of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| And I hope this gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| And I'd like to thank Ms. Roddy for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Ms. Roddy, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| I forgot to call the councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| I might just suggest to the gentleman that he spend a moment after the meeting to talk to Mr. King, who's next to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| and make sure the specific locations are conveyed to him so he can have his staff look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| and do whatever analysis they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Mr. Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Right next to you to your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Mr. Delvaux, I just want to say one quick thing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| About ten years ago, there was an accident on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| Eight people were involved in an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| And there is no traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| Once you get underneath that bridge, there's no traffic light until you get to Deer Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| And I've been trying for approximately ten years to just get a stop sign over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| And I went through the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| I went through a whole nine yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| And it's like I've got to run around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Just make sure they know the locations, and we'll worry about talking to them later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| But make sure you convey that to Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Now, Councilman Grieve, you told us we were going to have a special guest for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2109)|

| 0:35:38| 220 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| I want to present everyone, the people, and everybody else, a special cake for fact time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| which will be having set next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111018?start=2148)|
