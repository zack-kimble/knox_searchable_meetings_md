| 0:03:27| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| The first one has to do with the distance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Officer Huskin, how do we deal with the fact that there is currently both a church and a school using this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| Is it preexisting, nonconforming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Second question is, I was a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| At the back of our packet, there are two certificates of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| And the first one indicates that the request is to be issued to Culver Schmidt at Long Ragsdale and Waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| I have a feeling he doesn't intend to hold this permit and wondered why there were two certificates of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| for the same property with different names listed at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| Is one of these in error or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| If you go to the back of the packet, it is about four pages, three pages, four pages back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| I think they're both C2, which is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Apparently, two different people asked for these zoning verifications, suspenders and a belt, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=263)|
| 0:04:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| So, but I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| But that has nothing to do with the issuance of the permit to Mr. Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| No, the permit is not to Mr. Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Normally, we don't have that representation in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I understand the question is answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=291)|

| 0:07:47| We're jumping the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| We're on our rhythm off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| He never said much of anything, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Can I just ask the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=471)|

| 0:08:09| Your application doesn't have that checked on the form, but, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| You're following through on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=492)|

| 0:08:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| I guess, Mr. DeLaVolpe, what we get, the form we get here is how things were as of Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| And when the chairman is asking Ms. Martin or Ms. Day, they'll list anything as still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| unchecked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| So they have, on this one, although it's not checked here, since last Thursday, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| completed their task certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=518)|

| 0:08:43| That's part of the way the system works, and it's not quite clear at the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=523)|

| 0:11:19| Yes, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Just a point of clarification since these go pretty quickly, but sometimes they might get by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| When we say no record, you've checked for the criminal aspects to make sure that we have no crimes of moral turpitude of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| They come in in our fingerprint of our unit, and we check their background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| And when Dottie says file's complete, that includes the training that we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| That includes the alcohol class, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| And for something like Walgreens, where you have maybe shifts and different folks that are going to be at the registers checking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=711)|
| 0:12:02| people, is everyone trained that will handle beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Or do you have a special checkout place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| No, everyone is trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Everyone will be trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| And when they find a new staff person, they will go to training before they start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Is that part of their orientation, I assume, when they're hired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| I think the training is probably in-house training, not necessarily our alcohol class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| I think that's what she's implying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| You have a special class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| She's standing right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Let's let her talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| It's in store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| How many hours is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| What's the process since you're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Enlighten us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| I'm not sure here how long it will take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| This is our district manager, Doug Hamburger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| Could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| My name is Doug Hamburger, and my Knoxville address is 2100 St. Ives Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| And in answer to your question, we've got several things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| Part of their orientation and part of what we're preparing for, of course, anybody that currently works for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| we've got what we call a people plus learning module, which takes them through all of the different legal aspects of checking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| identification, making sure that the person is competent of, you know, purchasing the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| And we go through who should be stocking the shelves, not stocking the shelves, what to look for as far as death prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| And this is completed right after they hire, before they can go to the registers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| And then daily, we also have an automatic thing that comes up on the time clock that when anybody punches in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| it goes through a brief reminder of what to look for as far as IDing people so that they're reminded on a daily basis and they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| to go ahead and punch that they accept, you know, the responsibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| I was just going to ask, does someone from the staff undergo the police department's special training, or do you only do that in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| No, we do that with our store managers, that with the store managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| Each store manager has the full training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Thank you, Chairman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| I'd like to call on Officer Husky, please, just to remind the beer board again what our rules are in terms of the task training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| and who exactly would need to go through that with each new beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| Currently, the city code requires the permittee or the on-site manager to attend the class prior to getting a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=866)|

| 0:21:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| The addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Ms. Martin, if I could excuse you one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Could you explain to the board here kind of what we're doing on this one here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| I will try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Occasionally, we add to the agenda consideration of applications already considered by you that were passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| subject to final documentation, or approved, rather, subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| And from that point, they have 90 days to complete their requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| And if they do not complete their requirements within the 90 days, then the beer permit goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1299)|
| 0:21:47| It's no longer valid, and they have to go back and start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| So we bring these to you to ask that you give them some consideration for a continuation of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| They've already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| We're just asking you to add, give them some additional time to complete their requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| Have you heard from any of these applicants that are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| I have not heard from number one, latitude 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| But we did get a signed card back on the registered mail, but we have not gotten a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1331)|
| 0:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| No, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| So we'll go through these individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| and we'll need a motion to extend for, what, for 28 days or we could extend for however long, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1347)|
| 0:22:37| Until the next meeting, until the meeting of March, whatever you want, whatever you think is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| Typically, if somebody doesn't show up, it would be more likely to be 28 days until the next regularly scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1363)|
| 0:22:52| And I would like to, you know, I guess from the chair, you know, this is something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| I think we should give them some latitude here, excuse the pun on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| But, you know, this does, you know, tax our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| I mean, they have to continually be updating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| I don't know that we want to go on and on and on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| But so I just as long as we keep that in mind that eventually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| we need to make a decision whether or not they're really serious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| So with that in mind, number one, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| I was wondering what we might do from this point going forward in trying to notify them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| or doing some sort of a letter or having somebody reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1412)|
| 0:23:41| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| They received a letter from us notifying them of their status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| and asking them to send a representative to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| And we, as I said, had the signature card back on this one that registered mail was picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| They did not contact us further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| What will we do from say we give them another extended until the next beer board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| What will we plan to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| We'll write them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Just write them a letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| And it will be registered mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| And we can try to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| We can try anything that's available to us, but we can't make them do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| I wonder if we visited the establishment just to see if they have taken it for granted that they have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| You know, sometimes we have businesses that come before us and, you know, truth be known, they're operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| They don't have a license, in-between licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| I'm just wondering if, you know, I'm one that would like to take every measure we could possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| to give them the fullest extent and chance to come in here and take care of what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| But I was just wondering if that's a thought, Officer Huskey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| maybe if we visited the establishment just to see what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| And we do periodically just to make sure they haven't changed hands, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| But, you know, a lot of times the place is not even open or they're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| You know, they're still working on their stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Sometimes they're hard to contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Maybe if we tried it once, just went by once and tried it, along with the letter, maybe a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| Could we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| So what's Councilwoman Roddick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| I know with the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| I'm obviously an at-large council member and a year board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| and I know with some previous members of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| occasionally when there was an addendum like this presented prior, once that addendum was published prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| a council person with a business in question in that district might try to contact them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| or might go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| And sometimes when that information has been brought to us, it's helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| particularly if, you know, a business is enmeshed in trying to get open and is juggling a lot of balls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| a reminder that it would be prudent for them to appear in front of this board and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Usually there's extenuating circumstances of some kind with that business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| But when nobody shows up, you know, then we're kind of left wondering how to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| What is the net effect if we don't extend, that they have to start the entire process over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Of these three, one of them says the notice that you sent by registered mail was returned unclaimed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| Does that mean there's no business presence there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Well, I haven't visited the site, so I cannot testify as to that circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| But I can tell you on number two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Hang on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1606)|
| 0:26:55| We have reason to believe that number two and three may actually withdraw and not continue to get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| But I don't have that in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| So I'm unfortunately cannot give you definitive information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| But the purpose of the extension is to give them additional time to get their ducks in a row?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| To give them the time to complete it if they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Without serving liquor or beer in the interim, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| They are not authorized at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| So we're giving them the courtesy of getting their ducks in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| No further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| I'll make the motion to on latitude 135.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| This is the one we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| To extend until the next beer board meeting to allow them to complete their documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| Extend 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Are there further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| So number two is smoke and beer outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| I'll move to extend until the next regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| There's a motion to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Are there any further questions or comments on that on number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Opposed, black sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| And toolbox bar and grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1696)|
| 0:28:24| I'll go ahead and make a motion to extend to the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Further questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Opposed, black sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| You'll notice under B, this is previously presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| And so we're going to read here that they were granted a 30-day extension in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| August, September, October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| And a 60-day extension granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Can somebody give us the background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| Actually, Mike Elliott, could you come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| If you give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| He's going to explain to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Mike Elliott, 234 Douglas Avenue, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| For those who weren't on the board before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I've opened what had previously been a market in Mechanicsville and was in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| or it had been a market in Delhi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| They had sold beer there at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| but I didn't see that as the most viable or maybe the best thing for the community to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1771)|
| 0:29:42| continued service in that same role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| And so I was pushing toward making it a restaurant so that I could have alcohol service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| or beer service on-site rather than off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| And the extensions that kind of came around, there was a lot of confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| but in the end it was to try to go to B4MPC to see what would need to be done to approve that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1799)|
| 0:30:09| and make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| In the end, after talking with the building department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| it seems like there's just too many obstacles right now for me to do that as far as trying to have parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| And I need just to move forward in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| And so instead of fighting it, I'm going to embrace it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| and put in a certain percentage of the store as a market back as it was prior to my purchasing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1828)|
| 0:30:38| And it will change a little bit, but I don't think it will be a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| The only concern I have is I would like to have it ultimately have a dinner business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| Now, if I am able to sell beer off-premise, I think that's the only option I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| Is that correct as far as the market goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Does anyone know the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Charles, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| What is your zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| C1H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| I'm not sure why you would be limited to off-premise unless you don't have the proper seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| Is that the issue here, Dottie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| I understood it came down to a use on review and going before MPC with that application in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| But you've chosen not to pursue the use on review and to work within the current use, which is a market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| And what you're asking is just like when J&J's had a little counter, you're asking, can you serve beer at that counter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1893)|
| 0:31:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| No, you'd have to have the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| There are certain regulations about being able to serve on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| And so you'd have to have the appropriate amount of seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| And you'll have to go through the use on review process to get that permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| If that is a possibility at some point, that will be the way I'll approach it and we'll see where it ends up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| If I'm not mistaken, this is a facility that's fairly close to the police training center, the Moses Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| and is in a historic building that you're restoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| And did you actually take your plans to MPC and try to get the use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1943)|
| 0:32:31| You know, the obstacles that would – it seems the differentiation is restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| And the – as far as a restaurant goes, there's requirements for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| And there are ways I could get around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| But there's street parking in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Yeah, it's fairly convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| And there's actually more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| As far as to get the seating up would require another bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| All things that I would like to do at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| But at this point, I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| The best thing for me to do, as far as I can tell, is to move forward within the guidelines of what I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| So you're saying financially you're going to back off until you can muster the ability to do that second phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| Yeah, or third or whatever this is at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Last, Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| I guess I'm glad to know you're willing to keep moving forward in some fashion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| And I guess I wanted to say to Mr. Whittle, I know you follow this a little more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| I think it would be worth figuring out what we need to change in the law that has created this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| because this is not how we want the inner city to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| So if you can figure out what we need to change to make sure in the future we don't run into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| I'd actually think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| I was going to ask Councilman Woodhull if he wouldn't, for the benefit of all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| especially the new members, kind of give us a brief history on what took place here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| and the measures we took to waive the fees, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| MPC fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Use on review fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| You ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| It was a dark, stormy night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| This market that is now a restaurant has been an amazing asset to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| I live just down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| And it is right next door to the fire hall, just down the street from the police academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| It's right in the heart of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| And Mike hires young people from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| It's become a kind of a hub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| So it became a very important spot to the neighborhood and to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| When he was pursuing the beer license, he came up upon a serious hiccup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2073)|
| 0:34:42| and that was he needed a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| But he did not have the money to pursue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| And meanwhile, it's become a great asset for not only people inside the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| but people outside the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| So I brought that conversation to the beer board and asked would they consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| since it's such a significant community asset and a significant building block for our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| would they consider if I introduced a resolution at council to waive the fee for a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| would they look favorably upon that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| And we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| And, of course, before I even asked this body, I went to Mark Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| and inquired if he felt comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| There might have been some concern from some people that if we said yes to Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| then there would be all kinds of other people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| But in this instance, it was clearly part of our mandate to build strong, safe neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| And so in the kind of algebra of how we're building this city, it made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| Yeah, and I think also, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| we were a little clumsy and not so accommodating when he originally came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| And that's part of why we felt that we might take such measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| And if I could say something, I would say possibly the issue of the way it originally came up was because of the H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2166)|
| 0:36:14| We're concerned about how does this impact these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| And as far as the type of building that I have, it's a mixed-use building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| So it's commercial on the lower level and residential on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| And that brings a whole other dimension to the game altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| These markets that are around, you see them in Fort Sanders, you see them all over town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| And a lot of them have kind of died out because that market is not when we've got a food city right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| We have to compete with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| And with our community in Mechanicsville, there is another market in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| And there's a potential for it not to be a positive influence on the area, you know, because of, for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2212)|
| 0:37:00| selling beer going out the door, if I had the choice, that was my big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| I'd rather have it on site where it discourages, you know, just that steady flow of traffic and, you know, not a positive light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| But I think I can adjust to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| And I think that it's something that can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| I'm not sure what, how it can be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| But now that I think it's been seen before, it might be a little bit more understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| But it's, I don't know, I'm not sure what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| But I think that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| It's just some of these communities, these commercial, it is important that there's something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| And what I've come up with, I think, is about as good of an idea as can be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| And if we can find some way, yes, that is what I'd like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| But, you know, I'm working toward it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| And ultimately, I think we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| So what's the Board's pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Well, what are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Well, I mean, you can either do, take no action, and I assume it would die, and or we can extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2274)|
| 0:38:04| What's the status of his application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| He's been approved subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| So he just needs the time to complete whatever has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Well, and I think at this point probably what I'm saying I'd like to be done is we just go ahead and approve it for off-site use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2297)|
| 0:38:25| I'm just going to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| It was submitted as on premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| On and off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| So I think what he's asking you is to amend it to off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2311)|
| 0:38:41| But, frankly, it's not on the agenda for that purpose, and we don't have the appropriate notice for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| And, you know, I hate to keep throwing up things that are problems, but that's my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| And so because you don't have notice on that, I think you ought to continue it until the next beer meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| And then at that next beer meeting, put it on the agenda and allow him to amend it to off-premises only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2340)|
| 0:39:10| and then vote for it for off-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| That would be my suggestion to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| What does that do to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| It doesn't do anything to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| It really doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| It makes him have to come back here again next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| Mr. Swanson, what's the best and how do we need to go about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| But what's the best way for him to have an on-off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| I mean, he's got an on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Either go through the use-only review process or change the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| But you've got to recognize when you change the law, you're not going to change the law just for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| You're going to change the law across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| And it has certain impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Let me make a suggestion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| It's been a long time since I've sat in this seat, but I'm going to throw it out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| You all may not want me back, but would it be possible for us to have like a five-minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2398)|
| 0:40:06| or whatever beer board meeting prior to the next meeting and approve, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| if you can get your documentation and approve it at that point to get you up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| if that's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| But I didn't make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I'm just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2424)|

| 0:40:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| We're trying to work it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| We're trying to get you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| First off, we need a motion to extend it, and if it's the board's pleasure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| until the next meeting to where we'll have a special call beer board meeting in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| or 28 days or whatever the board's pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| So I've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Are there how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| How long do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Well, I would say for purposes of extending it, I'd extend it 12 and a half years if it would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| But let's extend it for 60 days and we can get everything fixed in that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| That will be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| It's an extension until he gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| And then so we'll need a separate motion for the special call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| We've got before us for the 60-day extension first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| So are there further questions on the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| And we've got a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Are there further questions on the 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| If not, all those in favor of the 60-day extension say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Now we can entertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Actually, you don't have to do a motion to a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Just tell the beer board you're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| You're the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| You will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| So we'll handle it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| We'll get you up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| I think that that will get us up and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| Is there any other business to come before this board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| Ms. Martin, you're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2548)|

| 0:42:35| We just want to make sure we get everything ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| And that doesn't mess the dinner or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2557)|

| 0:42:46| There's a good motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100126?start=2567)|
