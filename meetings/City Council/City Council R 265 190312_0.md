| 0:02:31| For the Mayor's report, first I want to start on some sad news, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| I want to extend my condolences and I think all of our condolences up here to the family and friends of Arthur Seymour, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=156)|
| 0:02:44| who passed away yesterday after a battle with cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| Many of us have known Arthur for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| I was just talking with John King a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| I served on county commission starting in 1990, and Arthur Seymour was a regular at the county commission meetings back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| and, of course, has continued on up until just recently to be at commission and city council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| He was a stalwart attorney, and because one of his specialties was zoning law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| he was a regular at council and commission meetings and planning commission meetings over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| Thanks, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| That was a really nice write-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| I guess, was that Jesse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| Nice write-up about Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| It was Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Let me just say the compass had a really nice write-up this morning about Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| So thank you to whoever wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| And I think we will all miss Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| We'll miss his grace, his friendly banter, his passion, his expertise, his desire to have me bend the rules sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=222)|
| 0:03:51| and I'd have to tell him, no, we've got to stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| But mostly his trademark fedora.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| We will remember him for that wonderful happy hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| So anyway, why don't we take a moment of silence right here in honor of Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=240)|
| 0:04:20| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| So on a happier note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| we want to make sure everybody knows that our police academy will be graduating this Thursday at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=265)|
| 0:04:34| We'll be celebrating and welcoming our nine newest officers at the KPV Phil E. Keith Training Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=274)|
| 0:04:42| which is on Cement Plant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| So we'll be celebrating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| We'll get a few more folks on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| But we're also planning for two more classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| We're currently vetting 44 officer candidates for a class that starts in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| and then another class will start in January of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| So if you're interested in exploring a career in law enforcement, if you know anybody who might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| please encourage them to call our recruiters at 215-7111 or 215-7313.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=306)|

| 0:05:20| I also want to make sure folks know that we're really excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| This Thursday, the Diversity Business Expo will be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| It's Thursday from 8 a.m. to 12 noon at Overcoming Believers Church in East Knoxville, right close to Vine Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=329)|
| 0:05:38| This is an opportunity for small businesses, and particularly women and minority-owned businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| to meet the department-level managers at more than a dozen agencies with the authority to make small purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| Among the participants who will be there, the organizations who contract for work, are the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| Knox County Government, Knoxville Utilities Board, Tennessee Valley Authority, the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority, and the Public Building Authority, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| So we encourage you to come out if you are a small business, particularly women and minority-owned businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| and meet the folks in each of these agencies who are responsible for procuring goods and services for our organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=378)|
| 0:06:27| That's this Thursday, 8 a.m. to noon at Overcoming Believers Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| And I want to give a big shout-out to Pamela Copham and our purchasing team for work, and all of our partners for putting this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=391)|
| 0:06:40| That is the end of my council reports. Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you very much, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| We have got some dates here for recode, and I'm going to ask Mr. Green to kind of help me through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| On April the 4th, we will have a workshop that afternoon here in this assembly room at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=413)|
| 0:07:02| And then Gerald, Mr. Green, will gather all of the information and comments from the free workshop that the council has held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=422)|
| 0:07:11| and send it to our consultant, who will then produce the final draft of the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| And that should come out mid-April, I'm assuming by April the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| No, I've talked with the consultants, and the timing is bad for them because the primary consultant will be on vacation the first two weeks of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| So we've had to move that back to the end of April for the last draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| Oh, boy. All right. Well, that should not slow us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| But anyhow, then we have, after we receive the draft and the public and council have time to read it and digest it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| we will have a meeting here in this assembly room on May the 14th, which is a Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=468)|
| 0:07:57| to consider passage of this proposal at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| So it's going to be a different time than normal, 3 o'clock on May the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| I just wanted to announce two things that are relevant to the Office of Neighborhoods and the Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=491)|
| 0:08:20| First off, the Neighborhood Conference is coming up in May, but they're doing a fundraiser tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| That if you go out and have beer at different locations, northwest, downtown, east and south, from 5 to 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=506)|
| 0:08:36| a percentage of all beer sales will go to the Neighborhood Conference to help fund that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Which, for anyone who's been to that, that's a great event to get information out to neighborhoods about different city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| So if you want information on where those locations are to go out and have beer tomorrow night with your friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| you can call the Office of Neighborhoods at 215-3077 if you didn't get their newsletter and know where those locations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| And then the other thing is Neighborhood Advisory Council meets tomorrow, their regular monthly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| and I think they have a pretty important agenda for a lot of neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| and that is they're having city staff from the engineering department to talk about water runoff and stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=551)|
| 0:09:19| which has been very important to a lot of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Chad West from the public services will be there to talk about curbside pickup and recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| And then Mr. Moyers will be there from Neighborhood Codes Enforcement to answer any questions and give a little overview about code sweep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| So if you or your neighborhood are interested in those topics, the Neighborhood Advisory Council meets tomorrow, Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| at 430-6 at the Kansler Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| And again, if you contact the Office of Neighborhoods, they can give you more info if you did not get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| But pretty packed meeting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| Thank you for making those announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| And, of course, we want to encourage everyone to drink responsibly as we raise money for the Office of Neighborhoods Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=594)|
| 0:10:04| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| I just wanted to let everyone know we're going to recognize for something different here coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| But one of our great neighborhoods in the 2nd District, West Hills, is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| So I just wanted to recognize that you all are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| And then I know watching at home, my daughter Hannah, it's her birthday today, and she got her permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| So congratulations, Hannah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| Responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| As well as the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Yeah, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Happy birthday and congratulations to your daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=637)|

| 0:18:17| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I would like to ask Ken McMahon to come forward just a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| and talk just a bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| I am obviously in support of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| but there was one piece of property that I did not understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| and I talked to Ken earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| It was the Taggart building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| If you could tell us a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| This was broken down into, I think, about six different parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| but the Taggart building stuck out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| I'm Ken McMahon with Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| The Taggart building is located at 3415 North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| which is across from sort of catty-cornered from Fairmont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| Which we will see later on in this agenda with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| So it's Broadway Development Partners has an application in to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| and what they're looking at doing, this is a 1939, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| art moderne architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| It has some sort of deco elements to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| It was developed in 1939 as a housing complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| and it's been vacant for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| So this group is taking it over and looking to develop it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| into market-rate condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| This, because they are selling these units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| and so it's not really truly a commercial enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| It's residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| We have asked that this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| instead of it being a forgivable loan, our monies will actually be repaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| So as they sell these units, we get the money back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| and hopefully get to use it on some more projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Hi, Kent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Ordinarily, I'm not in support of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| I don't think it's the city's role to do historic preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| but that's a whole other conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| What I am excited about is all of the items that we discussed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| I really like how they are building on top of each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| and I wouldn't mind you talking about the dollhobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| I'm saying it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| The whole Dobbs Building, which I think is going to be renamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| I think Kay Graviel is working a little bit with the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| And how many jobs are going to be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| So the whole Dobbs Building a few years ago received a facade funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| and it was owned by Henry and Wallace, and we did the facade program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| and then we finished the outside, which it looks much better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| but there's still no one in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| So it's not an economic development success story yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| Recently, in the last year, it was sold to the Blueprint Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| It was represented by Drew Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| and they have an end tenant already selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| which I believe Mr. Johnson may be affiliated with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| and that's Axel Logistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| which I believe they are located now within offices on Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| So they'll be relocating, I believe, around 60 employees when this is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| They look to grow up to as many as 150 to 200 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| They've also already purchased five vacant lots facing the graveyard back along there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1288)|
| 0:21:38| where they are using that room built that is their parking for their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| And they're relighting that whole corridor in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| so that the employees can safely get into work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| And then the street units will be retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| I think they're still planning on doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| The real exciting thing about this is that they're asking us to do some gap funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| particularly on the windows of $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| but their total investment will be between $6 million and $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| And I believe this is maybe one of the bigger successes we've had with our historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1332)|
| 0:22:21| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| You guys did a great job on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| I just had a quick question about one of the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| I do think this is an important role for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| because we have seen downtown and many other places that we would have lost to demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| that have been supported through historic preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| and put back on the tax rolls and really contributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| I will say as the fourth district rep, I'm really excited to see the whole Dobbs building move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| That has been vacant my entire time in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| So looking forward to welcoming that new employer to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| They are really going to impact our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| and put a lot of people in our restaurants and establishments there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| as well as folks that are going to possibly look to be housed in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| So that's very impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| One of the items here, if I can scroll back up to it, is the gap funding for the Park Ridge H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| So that funding is only – do you want to speak to that for a second and what area it applies to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| For one thing, it's not for Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| It's for the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| It's for all the maps that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| The historic overlay buildings would be eligible to apply to Knox Heritage for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| And by gap funding, we're talking about the difference between a vinyl window, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| and a wood replacement window that would be historically correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| So there might be a gap of $150 for that window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| So it's up to Knox Heritage to actually accept the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| and to do the income verification because there is an income limit on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| It's 100% of median, which sounds like a lot unless you're half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1444)|
| 0:24:16| But this gives them an opportunity for people to take a look at different materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Instead of doing vinyl siding, they can look at wood siding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| and something that's more historic for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| Just real quickly, it does say here H1 gap fund Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| So that's why I thought it was specific to Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| That's not their application. I'm not sure what your –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| In our packets, it says Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| So I noticed that there were maps for all of the H1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| So this 10,000 – and who will get those applications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| How will that be processed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Will that be through community development or through Historic Preservation Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| This is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Through Kay Grabeel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| This is an admin grant to Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Oh, it goes through Knox Heritage. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| And so we've had a couple of meetings where we've talked about the process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| I don't know that they've totally developed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| This will be something a little new for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| And income verification will also be something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Yeah, so the other one was for historic nominations both for South High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| which is under construction, but Standard Knitting Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| What's the – it was 3,500 was the amount awarded, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| So what's the thought for Standard Knitting Mill and the owners behind that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| Well, the only one that was awarded was for Standard Knitting Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| And so it – because South High is already on an H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| So we decided that was not the best place to put our funds for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| So did the owner participate in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| No, this is by Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| And so what they're doing is applying to the state for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| historic nomination for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| So it would enable an owner who took over Standard Knitting Mill to apply for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| if it was approved, for historic tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| So there's value to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| So it's up to Knox Heritage to make the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| Well, it's a difficult process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| I don't think most owners would take it on once they knew what it was like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| So it's good that they're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| But, yeah, they've done a few of these for areas more than single buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| but Standard Knitting Mill is a significant building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Thank you, Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a cost reimbursement agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| with Regas Quality Developments for drainage improvements in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| and around the intersection of Kingston Pike and Paper Mill Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| for an amount not to exceed $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| We have Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| So, Mr. Hageman, this is a long creek with a lot of severe problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| I just kind of wanted to get why this one is in front of other ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| and, you know, you think this one is the most important along that creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| and just kind of get a little more update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| This was an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| It was a project that Regas pretty much has to do at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| and we get – if we put some money in, we get some community benefit out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| If they did it on their own, they would just replace the pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| They would not get the increased flood capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| They would not get the improved water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| And, of course, it doesn't fix the whole creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| but it is an incremental improvement in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| There's other large areas that are needing a significant amount of work, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| further upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| The canyon project upstream is in process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| and we're getting pretty close to an agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| We're also putting some money in on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Would it be the same way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| It would be we're putting in some money, but the property owner is putting most of the bill on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| So this goes from a culvert, contained culvert, to an open stream instead of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| And that's advantageous to you and you think to the quality of that stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| Both water quality, habitat, and for flood capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Take the roof off a pipe, and you have a lot more flow capacity than if you have a roof on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| They lose parking, but you get a better –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1727)|

| 0:30:38| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for and accept a grant award of $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Lisa Zenni to come up and speak to this for a moment and talk about how the artist was selected for this project and how many applications, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1843)|
| 0:30:55| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| The Public Art Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Please state your name, address, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| I think everyone knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| I'm Lisa Zenni, L-I-Z-A-Z-E-N-N-I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| I'm with the Arts and Culture Alliance of Greater Knoxville, and I help facilitate the work of the Public Arts Committee as a staff liaison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1868)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you, City Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| I think that there have been some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| There usually are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Why public art?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Those of us who attended the meeting for all kinds of elected officials at the Change Center last month were really surprised to hear the research from what drives tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1888)|
| 0:31:41| And when he said public art, of course, I sat up a little straighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| It really does help generate tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| We have done a lot of research with American for the Arts, and every time someone comes to Knoxville, is drawn to Knoxville by our public art, they spend $95.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1910)|
| 0:32:02| So public art is a really wonderful way to promote everything you want and minimize everything you don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1922)|
| 0:32:11| It promotes visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| It promotes investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| It is an attraction for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| It fights vandalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| It fights all kinds of negative perceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| It helps create a sense of place, which is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| We are looking for other places to do public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| I invite all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| I've had trouble finding places for public art outside the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| And so if you have places in your district, I've already talked to Councilwoman Sincerest that I was going to call you Seema, and then I thought, that's not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1958)|
| 0:32:49| About that, it has to be on city property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| But this place cried out for public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| It cried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| If you look in your packet, you see an empty wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| It's like an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| And it really needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| And we were encouraged because of the success of Strong Alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| People go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| They have their pictures taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| It's a gathering place for kids in their prom regalia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| And, you know, it really was a good place to do something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| We sent out, with the help of our wonderful purchasing department, press releases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| We sent out to a national listserv on September 6th and September 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| All artists who have ever applied for anything that we've put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| And anybody who's asked to be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| The Arts and Culture Alliance has a membership database of 525 local artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| We sent that out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| We invited them to submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| We got 40 total responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| And among those 40, there were four from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| And we were delighted to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| There were also three from the region and two others from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| So that told us that the word did get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| It wasn't a big secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| We went through all those 40 and we selected 13 that we invited to make proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| Here's the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Draw us a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| You can do it with crayons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| We don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| What would you do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| And we even said, we'll pay you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| We'll give you a little honorarium for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| And 10 artists got back to us in a timely way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| And we looked at their proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Two artists got back to us after the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| And one artist didn't get back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| And the artist that didn't get back to us was our Knoxville artist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| We can't hire you if you don't need our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| So we followed up with this artist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Because we care a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| We want to attract local artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| We want this money to stay here in our local arts community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| And his response was very good and reassuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| He said, you didn't do anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| It was perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| You were very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| You answered all my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| But I had a business decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| And I, as a businessman, was having a hard time doing all the work I had already had contracts for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| It was not prudent for me to seek another job at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| I have to serve the people that have already paid me deposits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| And so, in a way, I was happy for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| But in a way, I was disappointed for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| But that's why we did not and were not able to consider that particular artist who was from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| We did select Carl Addison Kelm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| He is a National Public Art Award winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| He has done this kind of work all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| He's won awards for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| He goes into these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| He himself, on his own nickel, has asked us if he can come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| He will come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| It will be times when we are bustling downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| He will take up to 200 photographs of Knoxville faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| It will be Knoxville faces on that wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| We specifically asked him not to include faces of people that the average bear would recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| You know, I love your face, Mayor Rojero, but we see enough of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| And we want diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| He said, I want you to know I'm looking for diverse places because we live in a diverse world and a diverse nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2195)|
| 0:36:43| And you live in a diverse city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| And we were delighted to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| So he will take 200 photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| He will submit a selection to us of about 15 or 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| We will take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| And if he has inadvertently taken a picture of somebody who we all recognize, then we'll say, eh, maybe not that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2216)|
| 0:37:05| And then he will do his work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| He has specifically asked to meet with local artists when he comes for that visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| He has specifically asked to talk with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| He is somebody who wants to be a part of the broader artist community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| And we know our artists want to talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| What does he know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| What does he do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| And, of course, we want him to talk to them because in his budget, he shows he will be hiring local artists to help him execute this mural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2246)|
| 0:37:35| As a matter of fact, if you look at this budget, you will see that $79,000 of it stays right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2255)|
| 0:37:44| People he has to hire, vendors he has to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| And so that's another benefit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| This money is going to stay right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| We want it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| We love the community connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| These will be Knoxville faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| This mural will have something to do with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| It will stretch out the length of a football field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| It will be huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| And we know that when it's up, people will love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| It will feel like it is theirs because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| I have had some questions from people who say, you know, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2296)|
| 0:38:26| And I just have to say, I've even had people say, gee, you know, my high school kid, if you put out paints or whatever, I mean, they could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2306)|
| 0:38:38| But, you know, our wonderful UT basketball team had a great winning season that attracted a lot of money here to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2318)|
| 0:38:47| Not because they had people on the team who could play, but because they had people who could play well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| They recruited people for the team who could play well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| And we deserve artists who can do this well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| And it costs money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Okay, let's see if there are some other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Councilwoman, or Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Yes, Ms. Denny, like I said before, you can certainly sell Snow his Eskimos for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| I always come away enthusiastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| So, logistically, I mean, if you've worked out, this is a pretty busy alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| He's got a six-month plus timeline to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| And, I mean, you've worked out the logistics of getting in and out of that alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| I go walk by that alley frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Yes, it will be his job to communicate when he's going to have the scissor lift there and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2378)|
| 0:39:47| He is doing it through our friend Rick Emmett over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| He has talked to engineering already about that, right, Rick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| He knows what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| And you'll have, I guess, drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| You're still in control, or your board is in control of the content of the mural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| When he has a finished design, we have to approve the finished design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| I love this artist's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| I checked out a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Very creative, very innovative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| It's good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| However, I like Strong Alley even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| Art is just exploding and sharing what they have with Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| It's original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| It's fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| I really like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| I'd love to see more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| I have a concern that the city has spent a lot of money in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2437)|
| 0:40:45| It has paid off very well with tourism, with community space for gathering, for arts, for festivals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| I would like to see that spread around more to areas that aren't doing that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| So, I was really excited to get your email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| And I'm looking forward to talking to you about what we can do in the 3rd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| if we can use a piece of public art to make some sort of community space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| We want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| That's what public art is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| It's to generate interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| It's to support economic development efforts and to create a sense of joy for the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2477)|
| 0:41:27| That's why we need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Thank you, Ms. Denny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| As always, if only you had some passion for your work, you could really do a good job here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| I'm an old woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| One opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 18-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| I would like to ask Jim York to come down here and kind of go through this rather long list of changes in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| and additions and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| And I will say I very much appreciate and I suspect my colleagues do the memo you sent to all of us explaining some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| I apologize for the dichotomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Putting finance after an artist is probably not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| Passion there, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| What you have before you is a rather unusual budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| I'm going to divide it into a couple different parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| Part of this is what we consider pure housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| which is a reappropriation of all the encumbrances that were outstanding as you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| And that's very standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| That's consistent with accounting procedures and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| There is a second grouping, which I would call quasi-housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| And those are we are reappropriating the outstanding balances in the affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| portable rental development fund, and the historic preservation fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| Those are, again, existing balances that were outstanding as of year end, and we're just budgeting those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2609)|
| 0:43:38| The third piece is basically everything else, and that's the laundry list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| and I'll kind of go at it and try to answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| There are other people here that if you have very specific questions they can answer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| First off, I want to point out that we have a grant, a $450,000 increase for VolNavy Docs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2632)|
| 0:44:04| That is basically we've already budgeted the city's match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| We did that, I think, a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| And we've now got the full amount of the grants, and we are appropriating those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| It's $400,000 from the state and another $50,000 from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| Again, that's a pretty standard kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| We have a grant for Ned McWhorter Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| Do you want to give these numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Do you have your AIS in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| I have my sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| I may not be able to match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Ned McWhorter's number six on the AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Again, a total budget of $542,000, of which roughly $237,000 is from a state grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2681)|
| 0:44:51| And the city will be roughly $305,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| Again, next up, Knoxville Convention Center Fire Repair, or KCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| I'm going back to understand how the AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Last year we had anticipated putting in a fire repeater system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| That is something that's needed to enhance radio signals in the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| We had planned to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| It didn't get done, and neither was it appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| So we are taking $70,000 that we would have spent last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| and reappropriating those so those can be spent this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| Next up is an additional $1 million for the Affordable Rental Development Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2735)|
| 0:45:43| That's, again, $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| That's over and above the reappropriation of the outstanding balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| Sutry Landing, an additional $536,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| I think when bids came in for the project, we didn't have sufficient funding to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2758)|
| 0:46:08| and we're requesting an additional $536,000 for that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| Next up is public infrastructure on South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| That is $2 million, and that's basically to address some of the issues with form-based codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| which require underground utilities, and, again, $2 million for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| North Central Streetscapes, an additional $517,000 to fund a current amendment, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2791)|
| 0:46:43| and another amendment that we think is going to be coming in the amount of roughly $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| Again, that is because of, again, bids and some changes in scope of the project and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2811)|
| 0:47:01| But, again, we've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| We've got an additional $95,000 for the day space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| This is security at the day space along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| And next up is another $245,000 for a grant that will be used to help construct a low-barrier shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2831)|
| 0:47:22| again, to address some of the homeless issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| Next up, we had a project to renovate fourth and fifth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| This is part of relocation and an attempt to consolidate our engineering and inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| and basically make that a more cohesive functioning unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| We are requesting an additional $100,000 to complete that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| A portion of it is for the fourth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Most of it is going towards the fifth floor renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| An additional $50,000 for Ed Cothran Pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| Again, bids are coming in higher than what we anticipated on most of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| So, again, $50,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Next up, we have additional funding for Augusta Quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| That's $770,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| $330,000 of that is coming from a grant from the Aslan Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| Finally, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Well, we have two more to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| Next up is $150,000 for remodeling Fire Station 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| Again, that's the fire station on Linden Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| Again, as we say, bids are coming in much higher than what we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| I guess that's good because that means there's a demand out there for a lot of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| And then I think last up is an additional $33,700 for recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| $23,000 of that is for kind of like ancillary expenses, and that's going to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| And another $23,000 was for a mailing to all property owners throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2945)|
| 0:49:13| and that's actually going to be budgeted in the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=2953)|

| 0:51:31| Counsel, that brings us to public forum and we have one person signed up to speak, Mr. Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| Mr. Emmons, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| Please state your name and address for the record and keep an eye on the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3104)|
| 0:51:53| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| My name is Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| My address is 301 Woodlawn Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| I would like to speak on the issue of leasing trucks to the county for use in the inmate volunteering program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3120)|
| 0:52:09| that was discussed over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| So thank you for your work thinking through that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| I also have an interest in the good of our city, the good of our citizens, including inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3136)|
| 0:52:27| So I've personally volunteered inside of prisons and helped former inmates transition to life back in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3147)|
| 0:52:37| And at the same time, I might be wrong about what I'm saying tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| But I wanted to provide a different angle on the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| Maybe it's in the past, but I still wanted to provide a different angle on the debate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| So our city, I believe, should have high standards for justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| And at the same time, we must have a spirit of generosity and mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| All of this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Because all of it's part of caring for our city rightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| But mercy only exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| What's the context that mercy exists in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| It's the context, unfortunately, of justice and punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| And punishment, this is like it takes a little bravery to give the opposing view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| but punishment is not inherently unloving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| So on the other hand, we also know that punishment is not always just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| So when requiring inmates to pay for things like toiletries or video calls to family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| it seems that when they must pay for these services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| it puts the burden of punishment for the crime on those who did not commit the crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| such as friends and relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| So such a punishment does indeed seem unjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| And on a similar note, our anger is merited when minority and poor communities are policed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| in an unfair or prejudiced way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| We also know that not punishing crime is unjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| Those who commit a crime ought to be the ones who bear the burden of its punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| None of us, I'm pretty sure, have a problem with the idea of retribution going forth to those we dislike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3260)|
| 0:54:29| But we compartmentalize justice into boxes, sometimes based on our whims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| In many cases, we forget what crime has merited punishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| and doing so abandons the victims of crime and neglects the love and compassion we should have towards them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| So I've recently been wondering, trying to think through this, why jail exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| and realized its existence isn't inherently good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| I wish it didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| But it can serve a societal good of being a place of consequence for those who break laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3300)|
| 0:55:10| no matter their economic means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| A poor man who oppresses the poor is doing wrong, just like a rich man who oppresses the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3313)|
| 0:55:22| They're both like a driving rain that destroys crops and homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| This is a picture for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| Cities are also rightly aroused by the environment of much of our city's criminality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| which is poverty, cycles of oppression, abandonment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| and yet wrongdoers earn consequences for their unjust actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| We need to be fair in our application of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| But here's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Should inmates justly punished with a jail sentence be allowed to labor in order to receive time off of their sentence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3353)|
| 0:56:03| It's already an act of mercy to allow such volunteering to take place, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| There's no coercion, we already heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| They receive a substantial reward for their labor, time off of their sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| And so in a sense it's not volunteering to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| But even if it were volunteering, work outdoors is dignifying and humanizing if they choose to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| It's already an act of mercy that benefits both inmates and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| Paying inmates who are already receiving a reward for their work could lessen the nature of the punishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3396)|
| 0:56:45| beyond what is thoughtful to the victims of the crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| It also comes at a greater cost to the average taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| Let them work outside of the jail for the benefit of the community and for their own restoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3415)|
| 0:57:05| but paying them beyond what they receive could upend the punitive portion of the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| and have negative consequences and costs for our city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| Thank you, Mr. Emmons. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Okay, Counsel, there's no other business, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190312?start=3437)|
