| 0:00:00| Lawyers don't think like real people, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| We rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=7)|
| 0:00:08| Defense rests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=8)|
| 0:00:09| Will there be closing arguments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=9)|
| 0:00:16| As I recall the rules, the city will have 10 minutes for their initial opening argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=16)|
| 0:00:23| The defense will have 12 minutes for their opening argument and then the city will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=23)|
| 0:00:29| the last word with two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=29)|
| 0:00:31| Closing argument, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=31)|
| 0:00:32| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=32)|
| 0:00:33| Closing, not opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| We're not opening yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=34)|
| 0:00:35| Did I say opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=35)|
| 0:00:36| I beg your pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| I meant closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| Are the parties ready for the argument?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| Mr. Swanson, the city's witnesses have been in the other room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=41)|
| 0:00:46| Some of them may want to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| Some of them may want to hear the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| May Ms. Evertine go and offer them that option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| Both sides may have the opportunity to bring the witnesses in if they prefer or I assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| that the witnesses now may be released if you wish to release those witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| Mr. Bell, do you have any objection to the release of the witnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Can I ask to please file witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| I would anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=71)|
| 0:02:30| Mr. Swanson, before we begin, I need to, for the record, do some looping as we legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=150)|
| 0:02:55| call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| At the beginning of the hearing last night, I asked that the chairman recuse himself for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=177)|
| 0:03:07| the reasons I read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| You said that you would, at the conclusion of the hearing, I think, I don't want to misstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| what you said, but you said that that decision would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| And so I guess now would be that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| After closing statements, I will make a statement to the entire veer board as to the way they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=207)|
| 0:03:35| are to make their decision in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| And at that point, the chairman may make his decision as to whether or not he wishes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| recuse himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| But if you want to renew for the record your request that the chair recuse himself, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| certainly I want the record to reflect whatever you need it to reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| I'm not trying to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| I mean, we made a motion, had our hearing, and you deferred it until the whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| And I thought this was the time, but apparently I'm premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| That would be after your closing statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| But you won't be given an opportunity to make a motion at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| Are you ready for closing statements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| City, you have ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| It's 822.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| As I understand it, ten minutes and then two minutes rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| Members of the hearing board, the city appreciates your attention last night and tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| I have to get a few legal issues out of the way first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| The most tedious part is just to read a few sections of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| And I apologize for reading to you, but I need to make sure this is clearly set forth here in this closing statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=291)|
| 0:05:00| Under the Knoxville City Ordinance, Section 4-27C, it's stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| it is hereby declared that the sale of beer in the city is a privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| and the board is hereby empowered with complete discretion subject to the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| and procedures set forth in this article to issue, revoke, and suspend all permits to sell beer in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| and to perform such other duties and have such other powers and authority as provided in this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| Similarly, Section 4-73 states the beer board in part, 4-73A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=326)|
| 0:05:41| the beer board is hereby granted the right to revoke or suspend any beer permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| to any permittee who violates any of the provisions of this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| So this board is vested with broad authority to revoke and suspend beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| Now, as to the violations that the city has alleged in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| it's set forth in 4-34A, which states that it shall be unlawful for any permittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=363)|
| 0:06:17| or for any agent or employee of any permittee to sell, furnish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| or give away beer to any person under the age of 21 years or to any person visibly intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| Now, that section does say beer, but for purposes of this section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| there's a definitional section that says beer means beer or any other beverage of alcoholic content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| So it does include wine as well by virtue of the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| Then Section 4-78 of the ordinances states in part, I'm sorry, let me skip to another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=402)|
| 0:07:04| 4-79, I'm sorry, 4-97, subsection B, the manufacturer, sale, receipt, possession, storage, transportation, distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=424)|
| 0:07:18| or any other manner of dealing in alcoholic beverages within the corporate limits of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| shall be regulated in accordance with this article in TCA Section 57-1-101 at SEC and other sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=444)|
| 0:07:33| and also including 57-4-101 at SEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| And the manufacturer, sale, receipt, possession, storage, transportation, distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| or any other manner of dealing in alcoholic beverages were not done in accordance with this article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| And then those same TCA sections, including TCA Section 57-4-101 at SEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto is hereby declared to be unlawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| Now, our ordinance has expressly adopted 57-4-101 at SEC of the Tennessee Code Annotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=479)|
| 0:08:08| which provides in subsection 1A, any licensee or other person who sells, furnishes, disposes of, gives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=488)|
| 0:08:18| or causes to be sold, furnished, disposed of, or given any alcoholic beverage to any person under 21 years of age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| commits a Class A misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Okay, I'm sorry for having to go through the tedious reading of ordinances and statutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| but what I've just read to you establishes that any person who sells, any permittee who sells, furnishes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=513)|
| 0:08:42| or provides an alcoholic beverage to a person under 21 has violated the ordinances of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| with respect to the sale of alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| We have in this record, the city has in this record before you its certified complaint with the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=534)|
| 0:09:01| which establish that the city has made allegations against this permittee, Michaels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| regarding a number of matters, allegations relative to five underage sales, nine overserves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=546)|
| 0:09:16| and over 40 incidents of people, various things, DUIs, public intoxications, altercations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=556)|
| 0:09:27| all involving the conduct of this permittee, Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Now, Mr. Swanson accepted Exhibit 3, which is that exhibit, with an instruction to you that that was not evidence of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=570)|
| 0:09:41| that did not prove all of those allegations set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| I don't recall the city introducing any proof that he's arguing now to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| I was about to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| And if I could argue this without being interrupted, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| Let me see what he's arguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| He recited a list of allegations, and I don't, I may be mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=600)|
| 0:10:10| but I don't recall this laundry list of allegations that he just recited that has been introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=610)|
| 0:10:21| I may be mistaken, but if I am, I apologize to counsel and to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| But I don't, I do not remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| I frankly believe they were introduced in a large collective exhibit at the outset of the, at the outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| But let me ask Mr. Kaiser about that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| You want to respond to the objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| The certified copy of the complaint is Exhibit 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| As you correctly instructed the board, that complaint is not proof of those allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| However, the background for the consideration of this is that that complaint has been filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| and is awaiting a hearing before the hearing officer at the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Now, one of the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Argue that accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Objection overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| I've got a further objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| He said assaults of the citations that were sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Three is for underage service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| Nine is for over service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| One is for a prohibited sexual activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Eleven is for public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Twenty-six is for DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| Two is for simple possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Those figures arise out of individual arrests, some of which have multiple charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=700)|
| 0:11:49| For example, a DUI may be in possession of marijuana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| These are factors that we objected specifically last night for the very reason that he is arguing before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=715)|
| 0:12:07| We objected last night that they not be considered or admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| You limited it for identification only, gave a limiting instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| and now he has gone beyond the limiting instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| and because of that, no such instruction could cure it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| and we would move for a mistrial based upon—well, you laugh at me over this, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| but I take these responsibilities very serious because misconduct by a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| not representing that there were assaults when there is none there, is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=766)|
| 0:12:55| Representing that this board should consider matters that you limited by instruction to the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=775)|
| 0:13:06| and he argues that this is the reason why, as part of the totality of the circumstances, is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=786)|
| 0:13:15| And the totality and cumulative effect of that wrongfulness is a clear violation of minimal due process of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=795)|
| 0:13:28| as guaranteed under not only the United States Constitution, but likewise under the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=808)|
| 0:13:39| Laugh at me if you will, but there are people who have shed blood to fight for due process of law in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=819)|
| 0:13:50| and I am serious about this objection because it goes to the very core of why we have the Tennessee flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=830)|
| 0:14:01| and the American flag in this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| My understanding is that the nut of the objection is that he's made a reference to assaults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| and there are no assaults listed within the matters that are now pending before the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| Is that the essence of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| The fact that he's saying that they should consider all these other factors when you specifically told them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=867)|
| 0:14:36| that it was limited for identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| You gave a limited instruction yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| We can have it read back, I'm confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| He was referring to the limiting instruction at the time that he was interrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| That's part of the totality of the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| That's bootstrapping improper evidence into this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| It's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| It's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| There's no other way you can catch him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| What I want to get to is whether there is included among the allegations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| which is now pending before the hearing officer, any reference to assaults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| Is that part of what is pending before the hearing officer, or is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| If it's not, we need to tell the beer board that and we need to strike that from the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| If it is, then we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Mr. Swanson, during the discussion I checked with Ms. Evertine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| As I understand it, there was one where two patrons were fighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| but they were charged with public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| So I misspoke and I retract that regarding assaults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| I understand that you don't think that we can appropriately limit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| and I understand your objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Your objection is duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| I am going to instruct the members of the beer board to disregard any reference to assaults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=941)|
| 0:15:50| There is nothing in the proof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| and you will please remember the limiting instruction with regard to the matters that are pending before the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=953)|
| 0:16:01| Those may not be considered as proof of anything that's happened out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| They are simply to be taken as these are allegations, whatever they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| that are now pending before the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| They have not been proven and they are entitled to have a hearing with regard to all of those before the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| before they may be considered as proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| And I require that the members of the beer board do not consider those as proven facts in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=979)|
| 0:16:28| They may be considered for the purpose of determining those issues that are now pending before the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=988)|
| 0:16:37| who is assigned to this case, and they do not include any allegations with regard to assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| And you are to remember that they do not include any allegations whatsoever as to assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| You also said that there were five counts of underage service when, in point of fact, by our calculation, there are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1010)|
| 0:17:04| Well, there were two originally, and then there were two that were proven through the hatcher testimony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| and then there was the underage cell to the explorer, so there are now five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| There will be, I'm sorry, the fifth one will be added by amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| See, he's talking about uncharged misconduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Now he's adding additional counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| We object to this because the proof is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| You see how unfair this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| How can you call this system fair in America?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| How can you call this system fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, when the prosecutor in this case comes in now after the proof is closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| and say we're amending the added charges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| We move to mistrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| We asked you, you laughed at me, but I would like to have a ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| I would like to hear from Mr. Kaiser before I rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| There's no basis for mistrial at all whatsoever, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| In the argument phase of this proceeding, we should continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| What is the argument with regard to underage sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| What are you arguing with regard to underage sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| Because I want the members of the beer board to know exactly correctly what the allegations are with regard to underage sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1090)|
| 0:18:19| taking into account that these are not proven facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| These are simply allegations now pending before a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| Now, let's get that accurate before the beer board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Actually, I'm moving on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| I'm over talking about Exhibit 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| I'm moving on now to what the proof has established here with respect to underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| But I want to, because there was some reference made to the number of underage sales that were pending before the hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1120)|
| 0:18:50| I want the allegations with regard to that, the number of allegations, to be accurately before this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| And so what is that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| That number was originally filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| There were two underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| The Hatcher incident, the proof is established tonight or last night that there were two underage sales to Mr. Hatcher at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1142)|
| 0:19:12| And then the city will be amending to add this underage sale with respect to the Explorer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| That will be a total of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Your motion for mistrial is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| You may go forward with your argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Could I ask for a clarification on my time situation at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| When the objection was raised, you had about five and a half minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| And so we're going to give you five and a half minutes from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| First of all, I'd like to apologize for my misstatement about the salts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| I was thinking about the altercations, and those turned out to be public intoxication charges after I spoke with Ms. Evertine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| Moving on to the proof that was developed before the beer board, Jonathan Hatcher in May, the board heard Mr. Graham's testimony last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1193)|
| 0:20:03| It was uncontradicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| On two occasions, he bought mixed drinks at Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| He did not present an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| He told the server that he was under 21, and he was served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| And, unfortunately, he has now passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| That happened in May of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Now we come forward to December 28, 2006, when Officer Mateik and Ms. K, Explorer K, went into Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1223)|
| 0:20:38| Ms. K presented her ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| The server did not follow the instructions that she heard three weeks earlier from Lieutenant Woodridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| that being carefully check the ID, ask the customer to remove the ID from the wallet, and to present the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| Now, those were instructions that she heard less than three weeks before, but she did not follow those instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| Had she followed those instructions, she would have seen and read this ID closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| She would have seen the birth date accurately stated, but, moreover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| she would have seen the red bar to the left of the picture that said that this person would not be 21 until November 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1273)|
| 0:21:24| Now, you know, it's her responsibility to accurately check these identification cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| Her testimony is that she misread the eight for a three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| I don't see how she could have misread the red bar on the left-hand side of the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| That's clearly in evidence and clearly shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| And I think it's a clear violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| I don't think there's any question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| So we have here, since May of this year, we have three underage sales that the city has put on direct proof of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1310)|
| 0:22:00| and that Michael's has absolutely put no contravailing proof on whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| And I think under these circumstances it shows a permittee who's irresponsible, who's reckless with respect to underage sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1326)|
| 0:22:15| and the city requests that the suspension remain in place pending the hearing officer's determination of all these matters in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1335)|
| 0:22:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Mr. Bell, the time is 840.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| You have 12 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Would you like, I don't want to interrupt your argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| but would you like some kind of signal as to time as we go along, or do you just want me to tell you when it's over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| I'm deferring to the dean of the bar, Mr. Leavitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| The veteran trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Mr. Leavitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Go ahead and talk with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Then I'll ask you the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1377)|
| 0:23:10| I was going to ask you if you have 12 minutes for your closing statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| And I wanted to ask you, did you want some type of signal sometime out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| or would you just prefer to be told when you're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Without precaution, I ask you to give me two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| I'll give you a two-minute warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| I don't anticipate taking the whole 12 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| It is now 841, and you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| Ladies and gentlemen of the beer board, I've listened to the recitation of the ordinances that you're to be governed by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1421)|
| 0:23:54| And I suggest to you that basically where we are is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| tonight you can do anything you want to do regardless of these rules and regulations and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1441)|
| 0:24:12| Michaels is here at your mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| The sole issue, I think, that the presiding officer has indicated to you is that presently our beer license has been suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1457)|
| 0:24:33| We're not selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| And the sole issue is whether or not that suspension will remain in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1476)|
| 0:24:47| while other proceedings may be going on towards finally determining of a revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1487)|
| 0:24:58| or a suspension in conjunction with the matters that are already pending in front of Mr. Petty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1498)|
| 0:25:09| Bill Petty, your designated hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| That's solely in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| I've followed it all about the law, and it doesn't really make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| You know and I know you can do whatever you want about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| Now, here is where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| And one of the distressing things to me about where we are here today is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1530)|
| 0:25:42| For some reason, your city administration elected not to tell us before we came in front of you what we would be confronting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1542)|
| 0:26:00| The only thing they told us in this order was to deal with the sale to a miner on December 28, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1560)|
| 0:26:19| Now, that is basically the only thing in front of you that you haven't heard before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| that you haven't referred to Mr. Petty, that you know everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1587)|
| 0:26:37| You have already referred to Mr. Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And basically what we're here right now about is before Mr. Petty has an opportunity to do his job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1600)|
| 0:26:52| are you going for all these months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| It's already been now, keep in mind, a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| Are you, for a number of months, going to take Michael's beer license because this young lady that was in front of you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1623)|
| 0:27:23| serves something to the young lady you saw last night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| And here's the way I approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| For how many months would you suspend the police officer that testified that he looked at the driver's license of the hatcher boy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1655)|
| 0:27:49| that died on Alcoa Highway and misread how old he was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1669)|
| 0:28:02| Would you take that 12-year police officer's right to be a police officer away from him for an indefinite period because he made that mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1682)|
| 0:28:17| No, you wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| It's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| He made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Our young lady that you heard tonight, our waitress, our server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1708)|
| 0:28:38| she evidently made a mistake in getting the age off a driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1718)|
| 0:28:49| the same thing the officer that testified today did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| And he has only got 12 or 13 years' service with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| The city is asking that Michael's, who you have granted a beer permit for 26 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1742)|
| 0:29:13| to have their license taken over that girl's mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Leave it to Mr. Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| Let the appropriate proceedings be held to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1767)|
| 0:29:35| Mr. Petty may very well conclude they've sinned so much we're going to revoke their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1775)|
| 0:29:43| But don't take our license until that decision can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| Now, that's the only new thing you've had in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| And I just say to you, what is the fair thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| And I suggest to you to give temporarily until there's some further action by this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1803)|
| 0:30:13| by your appointed hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| The fair thing to do is not interfere with the orderly process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| It did not require us to make a full-blown defense to all these other pending charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1824)|
| 0:30:34| without being told that we would have to deal with them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| And not only that, only giving us a handful of days to prepare for it is just not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1840)|
| 0:30:53| If in your power, not as a beer board but as a city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1853)|
| 0:31:05| you could pass an ordinance requiring that this police officer that misread this hatcher boy's driver's license be fired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1865)|
| 0:31:14| but you wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| I wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| No fair-minded person would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| But that's what the city is asking you to do to Michael, is fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| Because this young lady you saw today misread a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1891)|
| 0:31:41| Now, I suggest this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| I noted this, and I think you did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| The customer looked older than the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1910)|
| 0:31:59| You saw her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| Didn't she look over 21 to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| I think she certainly didn't look like a teenager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| So what is fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| That's what I ask you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Forget about the quibbling between Mr. Bell and the city attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1937)|
| 0:32:26| All I ask you to do is what is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| All of this can be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| I'm distressed that it's going to take Mr. Petty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| and also the civil action that's pending over the death of this hatcher boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1960)|
| 0:32:50| I'm distressed that miraculously the pilot oil company tape has disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| That is going to be the subject of litigation in civil court in front of Mr. Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1978)|
| 0:33:08| The only proof that you have got that we had anything to do with the hatcher boy at all that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1988)|
| 0:33:19| was that this young man that testified, he saw him sitting at the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| and he had a glass in front of him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| and he can't tell you whether it was Coca-Cola or Strychnine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| And he was found dead some hours later with beer in cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2017)|
| 0:33:47| And we're a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| We don't sell beer in cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| All that is matters that are pending in front of Mr. Petty already so far as your board is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2034)|
| 0:34:05| And you heard the proof that contrary to what the city attorney told you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2045)|
| 0:34:16| the only reference to that young man at Michael's being under 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| was a comment that was made that he heard when he was three or four feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2063)|
| 0:34:33| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| So in conclusion, we are not asking by any stretch of the imagination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2076)|
| 0:34:50| that you find Michael innocent of any charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2090)|
| 0:34:59| That's not in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| We're not asking you to take a position to where the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| and I know you're elected public officials, you've got to pay attention to the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| We're not asking you to take a position where they can refer to you having cleared Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2115)|
| 0:35:24| We're not asking you to be cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| We're asking that we be allowed to operate under a beer license pending a final disposition of all these charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2128)|
| 0:35:44| and to do so as a matter of fair play where a young lady you saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2144)|
| 0:36:03| served a young lady, an older-looking young lady you saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2163)|
| 0:36:12| That that should not be the reason for you to say you cannot operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2172)|
| 0:36:21| during the interim of the final disposition of the charges against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| Again, I say we're not asking you to exonerate Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| Just don't make a final judgment today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| Let your normal administrative process proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| And if we lose our license, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| But please don't keep us from operating until that determination can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| Just very quickly with respect to the Hatcher matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| I think, again, the proof is uncontradicted that on two occasions, according to Mr. Graham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| Mr. Hatcher told a server there, I'm under 21, the server, I'm 20 years old, I'm under 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| the server did not ask for an ID and alcoholic beverages were served on both occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| With respect to this most recent incident, the Michael server thought that the explorer was young-looking, said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| wanted to carefully examine, said she wanted to carefully examine the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| But, in fact, she did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| This is not an innocent mistake, as Mr. Levitt would have you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Three weeks before that, she was instructed, asked the customer to pull it out, hold it, look at it, look for the red bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| She didn't do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| It was not an innocent mistake, as Mr. Levitt would have you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| It was a reckless mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| What we have is a permittee that in the period of a little over seven months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| the city has approved in this proceeding three underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| I submit to you that this permittee is reckless, is irresponsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| and it's dangerous to have a permittee who permits this to happen at their establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| It's dangerous to the safety of the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| And for that reason, the city asked this board to continue the suspension until this matter is heard by Mr. Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Thank you, Mr. Kizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you, Mr. Levitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Thank all the attorneys in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| The attorneys have done, I believe, an excellent job on behalf of both of their clients to present the proof to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| It's now about time for the Beer Board to undertake its responsibility in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| beyond just listening to the proof, but to make some decision based on what you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| Both of these attorneys have accurately stated for you the issue that you are to decide here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| The issue that is facing you now is whether you find it is necessary for the public health, safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2332)|
| 0:39:02| and welfare to maintain, in effect, the emergency suspension of this beer permit for this permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2342)|
| 0:39:11| until such time as the matter is heard before the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| That's the only issue that you are deciding here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| You are not deciding whether or not the you are not deciding those things that are before the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2361)|
| 0:39:30| with regard to suspension, revocation, fine, whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| You are not deciding that issue tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| It is, as I have indicated to you earlier, the city has the burden of proof in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| to show you by a preponderance of the evidence that it is necessary for the public safety and welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| to maintain this emergency suspension pending the hearing by the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| A preponderance of the evidence means you have to establish the elements of whatever it is you find as a basis for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2397)|
| 0:40:05| to be more likely than not based upon the proof that was adduced before you in this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| And let me remind you that the proof that was adduced before you in this hearing is the proof that came from that witness stand up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| from the witnesses who testified before you and the exhibits which were introduced consistent with that testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2418)|
| 0:40:27| It is not the statements of the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| It is not the arguments of the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| It is not anything that the hearing officer has said in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| Hearing officer, whatever I'm called, the presiding officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| Nothing that I said is proof in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Nothing that any of these lawyers have said is proof in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| The proof is only the proof that was on the witness stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| And you must find by a preponderance of the evidence the necessary elements that you find to make your decision in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| And that means more likely than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| At this point, the matter is going to be turned over to the beer board chair to lead the deliberations with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| As we do that, however, I would like to make sure that the beer board members have available to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| to the extent that they wish to have them, all the exhibits which were introduced in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| So whoever has the original exhibits in this case, which for the defendant would include, I think there were four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2476)|
| 0:41:27| Am I correct about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| Were there four defense exhibits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| Mr. Court Reporter, is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| 3A and 3B, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| And there were 16 exhibits admitted by the city, if I am correct about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| So I would like to have all of those exhibits available to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| What don't we have, Mr. Court Reporter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Let's go ahead and get those marked and I'll wait while we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| Oh, the one is the photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Do we have that photo available to us out of the officer's file so that they can use that to the extent that they need to use that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2527)|
| 0:42:17| We're going to substitute a copy of that in the official record tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| But to the extent that any member of the beer board wants to utilize that photograph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| let's pass that original to them and we will make sure that nothing happens to harm that photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| Please don't write on any of these exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| Don't in any way spoil any of the exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| You may look at them and use them, but don't in any way spoil them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| Ms. Mitchell, do you have any of the exhibits, any of the original exhibits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| They've been passed up to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| With that, is there anything else from the attorneys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| Can we approach you, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| You want me to go down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2581)|
| 0:43:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| No, this is because of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| I'll have that ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| I'll have that ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| I think I'm familiar with lots of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Photographic memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| I never saw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| I'll have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Can you put these all together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Yeah, there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| You never saw the first picture, either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Was this an exhibit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| It was an exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| I don't have that statue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Nobody gave it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| He was reading it out of the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| I don't remember reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| If I had it, it would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| I need a motion for more evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| I need a motion for more evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Come on in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| Can I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| Open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Can I get a motion for more evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2677)|
| 0:44:45| City number three, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| The collective exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2687)|
| 0:44:56| Is it the original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Let's have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| He wants to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| No, it was marked for identification only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| but then we allowed it to be introduced with the curative instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| So I want that to be passed to Mr. Bailey to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| Is that the statue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| All right, do we have all the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| Okay, right there is number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| All right, we have all of the exhibits have now been passed to the members of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| One additional matter, and it's been raised both at the opening of this hearing and not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2736)|
| 0:45:45| The issue was raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| There has been a motion made for the chair to recuse himself from consideration in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2747)|
| 0:45:54| and you all will recall the arguments made by Mr. Bell with respect to that motion to recuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| I would instruct the chair that the same thing that I instructed all the rest of the beer board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2761)|
| 0:46:10| The decision to be made in this case is a decision made based solely on the evidence that you heard last night on that witness stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2770)|
| 0:46:21| and that you heard this evening on the witness stand and is to be based on no other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| And it is not something that you come in prejudging that you already have an opinion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| You are to form your opinion based only on those things that you heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| So that being the case, I would instruct the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| and I would instruct all of you to the extent that any of you have prejudged this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| and are unable to put that prejudgment aside and base your decision solely on the evidence that you heard in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| that was adduced through the proof introduced in this case to the extent that any of you are unable to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| by reason of any type of prejudgment of this case or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| then I would ask that that member of the beer board recuse him or herself from hearing this matter further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| If you can make your decision, and that includes all of you, including the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| if you can make your decision and make that based only on the evidence that was adduced in the hearing both last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| and tonight, then it is up to you to make a decision whether or not you wish to participate in this hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| and it's up to you to decide whether you wish to make a vote on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| So I think having given you that instruction, I am going to turn this matter now over to the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2851)|
| 0:47:40| to either lead the debate or entertain any appropriate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| Well, first, before we get started, I feel like that after hearing the evidence that I can base a decision solely on the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| I've heard last night and tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| So I will not recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| So do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| I appreciate the efforts of the law department, Mr. Kaiser and Ms. Ebertine, making their statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| and making their arguments and those also of Mr. Bell, Mr. Levitt, and Mr. Ault's defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2890)|
| 0:48:20| This is a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| I mean, in the past number of hours, both tonight and last night, we've heard, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| some very important issues brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| We've heard evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| We've heard facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| We've heard arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Based upon the evidence, the testimony and the record, I'll make a motion to continue the suspension of the beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2917)|
| 0:48:48| until Mr. Petty's hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| I actually have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| And this is an advice question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| It might be inappropriate, and if it is, you'll, I'm sure, tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| One of the things I like about this body is we're really good at discussing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| Some people would say we talk too long, but we wrestle with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| We're willing to say things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| At the moment in this discussion, I'm inclined to not say anything because I have a feeling somebody's going to object| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| all of a sudden and I've said the wrong thing because it's a legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| And I just want to get sort of your advice on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| is this something that our discussion should be the kind of discussion we have at a meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| Or is this a discussion that, no, it's just about, you know, the, if you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| I mean, is this something we can go on like we usually do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| In my view, you are entitled to deliberate to the extent that you feel like you need to deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| to feel firmly in your mind that you're comfortable with what way you should vote on the motion that is now pending before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2989)|
| 0:49:57| You should feel free to engage in whatever deliberative process you feel like you need to do to reach a comfort level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| that you are prepared to vote in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| If you are prepared to do that without debate, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| If you feel like you need to deliberate to arrive at that, then that's all right, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| I think that's something that's totally within the province of this board to make a decision on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| Mr. Swann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| That answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| I don't think we're permitted to say anything as lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| We cannot do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| And I think it's a free debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| That's our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Counselman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| I mean, I guess at some level, having just said we talk about things, I'm inclined, of course, to talk about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| I mean, I was struck with the evidence that seemed there were a lot of problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| And the argument Mr. Levitt made in closing that somehow we should wait and, you know, it didn't resonate with me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3049)|
| 0:50:59| And I'm wondering if people – did anybody hear stuff that they felt like really made them question this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3059)|
| 0:51:09| Partly I do feel like I don't need to say a whole lot because it does seem pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| And I'd like to hear from folks, are there questions people heard in this that made you sit up and think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3073)|
| 0:51:24| Because I didn't hear that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| Counselman Moroni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Counselman Becker, in answer to your question, no, I don't feel the need to elaborate or debate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| I felt like the proof that was presented by the city was clear and straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| I guess the argument in the closing statements of the defense that this was just a mistake didn't ring true to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3104)|
| 0:51:56| because the consequences of a mistake of this kind can have – can be terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3116)|
| 0:52:05| And, you know, certainly there are other cases pending where there is a discussion of whether there is guilt or innocence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| And I recognize that that is not germane to our discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| But it remains a fact in my mind that the consequences of not accurately checking an underage person's ID are terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3135)|
| 0:52:25| It's an egregious error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| And the Veer Board has taken that stance during the time that I have been a member of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| And it was pointed out to us in our codes and ordinances that we have complete discretion to decide in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| And for me, it's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| It is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| Counselman Perales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| A question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Depending on how this vote goes, Mr. Petty's hearing is set for sometime in April of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| It was originally supposed to have been back in August of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| But for various reasons, it's been pushed back until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| Do you know if Michaels would be able to request that that hearing date get moved forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3193)|
| 0:53:24| That's probably not something you should make a decision on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| But I think the answer to your question and let me just say that I'm changing roles now in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3207)|
| 0:53:34| and becoming your sort of answerer of legal questions rather than hearing officer in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3214)|
| 0:53:42| And so I'm a little schizophrenic and I'm almost afraid to say anything because of that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| But I think that's not something that you consider with regard to whether you vote for the motion or against the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| But in answer to your question, I think that either of the parties could make a motion before the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| to move the hearing date either forward or backward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| and the hearing officer would consider that and make a determination one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| But I don't think you're going to have any idea tonight in making your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| whether the hearing officer would be amenable to that, whether the parties would feel comfortable in doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| either the city or the defense in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| So I think what you make your decision on tonight is based solely on whether you believe it is necessary for the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3263)|
| 0:54:30| and welfare of the public to maintain, in effect, the temporary suspension of the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| whatever that time period may be, before it comes to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Well, for sake of clarification and perhaps I should have prefaced my comments with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| I was asking that for the benefit of Michael's and in no circumstance whatsoever did that come into my mind when making the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3285)|
| 0:54:54| or making the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| These people, Mr. Levitt and his argument discussed about the delay between now and the time for his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| for the suspension hearing with Mr. Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| They're a very talented group of lawyers, and I bet they'll figure out if they want to move the time period forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| what they need to do in an effort to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| Councilman Helkos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| In listening to the debate so far, the discussion or deliberation so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| and having listened to the evidence and proof that's been presented over the last two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3326)|
| 0:55:34| I find myself pretty much in agreement, I think, based on what I've heard so far from Member Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| that given the gravity of the situation and what's at stake here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| I think it's not something to be taken lightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| and I think that it is incumbent on us to make a decision in the interests of public safety and health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3352)|
| 0:56:00| and the well-being of the public in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| I do not see the failure of the server to adequately address the issue of IDing the customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3363)|
| 0:56:17| as the same as a police officer not carefully reading the age on the ID or driver's license of the victim of the crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3377)|
| 0:56:28| As Mr. Levitt said, I think those are apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| I don't think you can compare them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| I mean, there's a chasm between those two in terms of the implications, the circumstances, and the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| that I don't think we can even come close to comparing them on a fair basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| And so just having listened to all the officers and the other testimony and the proof that's been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3406)|
| 0:56:56| to me it's clear that the continuation, the suspension until such time as the hearing officer acts is the only prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3416)|
| 0:57:07| and appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| I guess I need to just sort of get a clarification on this because I may have an opposite take on a couple of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3433)|
| 0:57:22| Based on what, you know, I'm here to decide on what I've heard over the course of the last two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3442)|
| 0:57:30| I understand what I've heard and what I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| But I also heard Mr. Kaiser say, refer to the cumulative record of Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3454)|
| 0:57:44| And so I really want a clarification on, you know, I've seen records of Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| We've had presentations before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| And if it's the cumulative record, I think that's a very serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3473)|
| 0:58:01| I think based on my experience on the beer board that we've gone, I have a feel for it, and I know that this is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3481)|
| 0:58:10| On the other hand, and so I guess I just want a clarification on, because I did hear Mr. Kaiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3490)|
| 0:58:18| in his closing statement refer to the record of Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| And I think the answer to that question is you take into consideration the totality of the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| that were proven on the witness stand here and in the exhibits introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| And I think if I'm understanding you correctly, what may be troubling you is these charges that are now pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| You may not consider those charges as proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| You may consider, as a part of the totality of the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| that there are a number of charges pending before a hearing officer with regard to this permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| You may not assume that those are necessarily true charges and that they're going to be proven as true charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| But in terms of the totality of the circumstances in determining the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| the very narrow issue that you are facing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| you may consider the fact that those charges are now pending before a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| I hope that is the best I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| I just want to say this to the attorneys and to Mr. Levitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| You said that, you know, you referred to the mistake by Michaela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| You referred to, you know, just a handful of days to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| You talked about the unfortunate death of the young man, Mr. Hatcher, and some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| And I think you guys did a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| And I also think the city attorneys did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| And I have a lot of respect for our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| And there's a lot of human errors that take place in all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| And so I guess I'm going to – I just want to tell you that I don't think that any group of attorneys could come in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3588)|
| 0:59:58| and defend a track record of mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| And so I guess what I'm saying is the last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| I'm going to go ahead and hear my colleagues and decide whether I think it's a cumulative record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| or if I think it's what I've heard over the course of the last two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| But I just appreciate everybody's time and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Well, I just feel compelled to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| It occurred to me as I've been listening to the witnesses, to the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| to the attorneys who have been representing both sides of the case that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| how am I going to respond to this and what position am I going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3641)|
| 1:00:51| And I am going to refer to something that Mr. Swanson has commented on several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| I'm sure Mr. Holquist also made the same comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| But when it became my decision to become a public servant and run for public office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3660)|
| 1:01:09| I knew that I had a tremendous responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| And having worked on the charter for so long, I'm very aware of the preamble to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| which says our obligation and our responsibility, in fact, it's basically our sole obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| and responsibility is to look after the welfare and well-being of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3684)|
| 1:01:34| And I take that very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Frankly, it's the only reason I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| So that comes to mind in ways of my heart when I have to make a decision like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| And I feel that knowing that and looking at it, I appreciate Councilman Bailey asking for the clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3706)|
| 1:01:56| because Mr. Swanson's words about the totality of the circumstances does come to mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3716)|
| 1:02:04| because there definitely is a totality of circumstances here that I feel I must respond to correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3724)|
| 1:02:14| And, consequently, I feel it's my obligation to allow this suspension to be extended until the proper hearing can be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3734)|
| 1:02:25| and the proper decision can be made by that hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| But I appreciate everyone's efforts in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| And particularly, well, comment also on the law enforcement officers who, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3752)|
| 1:02:43| seeing a young man in a situation like that, I don't know that it would be unlikely that one would make a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3763)|
| 1:02:57| or misread a driver's license when you're trying to see to his well-being and taking care of the totality of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3777)|
| 1:03:09| So I just appreciate everyone's efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| And I particularly appreciate the witnesses who have come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| because we could not have come to a decision on this without your willingness to participate in this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| So thank you all for your time and thank you all for the sincerity in which you have approached these hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| That's Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| You know, as I sit here and I always appreciate hearing from my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| and I definitely appreciate hearing the presentation from the attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| and a lot of the information is brought forth and I've enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| From a point of view of just watching, I guess, fellow attorneys do their work and do their work admirably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3827)|
| 1:03:56| Councilman Becker asked a question, whether or not there was anything that caused anybody to say hmm or to pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3836)|
| 1:04:06| And I must say that there were a few things that caused me to say hmm and to pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3846)|
| 1:04:13| And maybe that's because I wanted to work very, very hard and not that other people didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| I think they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| Very, very hard to try to continue to push back my opinion or my judgment until the very close of it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| and try not to reflect on some of the things that, as Councilman Bailey has mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| has come before this council before as it relates to this institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| There are some things that kind of make me, as you've heard, a comedian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| A comedian used to say to make you go hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| I do go hmm when I think of a driver's license being changed the day before a sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3885)|
| 1:04:54| And you kind of go hmm when a witness says, well, yeah, I knew I was going to go on that sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| And it gets changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| But in the end, does that justify or excuse Michael's employee's duty to look thoroughly at a license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3900)|
| 1:05:13| And for the purposes of what we are here today, in the light of fact, we're not here to judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| As Attorney Leavitt said, we're not here to judge Michael's innocence or guilt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| but to determine whether or not the suspension that is in place should stay in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| until an appropriate hearing comes about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| And with the low threshold of the standard that is put before us, a preponderance of the evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| I think that this city has probably met that low threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| And that's not an indication as to whether Michael's, in my opinion, is guilty or not guilty here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| That's left for hearing Officer Petty and other decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| But with the low threshold we have here of the standard of making our decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| I would say that the city has probably met that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| But I would have to say, Councilman Becker, that it was not a slam dunk for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| And there are even other issues that make me go hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| And that is not an indictment of anyone or any process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| I go hmm, and I guess it's the defense attorney and me when I hear of tapes disappearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| So there are things that make me go hmm or make me wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| But I do think that the burden has been met with regards to a preponderance of the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| to keep this order, temporary suspension, in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| But I did want to respond to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| As others have responded and said, they didn't have those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| But I did struggle and continue to struggle with a few of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| But I do think that ultimately the responsibility lies with Michael's and his employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| as it does with any server of alcoholic beverages in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| to make sure they do what is appropriate under the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| and trying to make sure that you're not serving to underage folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| I've always gone hmm when I look at our explorers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| And I used to wonder, you never come up with an explorer that looks 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| But obviously there's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| You want to put an explorer out there that's going to make somebody assume the wrong thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| so that hopefully they would do the right thing, which is to ask for the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| So I did want to say those things in response to Councilman Becker's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| and to say I do think that maybe the burden has been met, at least for the purposes of this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4050)|
| 1:07:39| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| The question before us is to continue a temporary suspension for Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| And I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Councilman Bailey? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Councilman Becker? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Vice Mayor Brown? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Councilman Frost? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Chairman Hall? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Councilman Holtquist? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Councilman Pelow? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Councilman Roddy? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Councilman Woodhull? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| By unanimous vote, the temporary suspension is continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4089)|
| 1:08:18| Do I get a motion to dismiss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| Adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd5?start=4103)|
