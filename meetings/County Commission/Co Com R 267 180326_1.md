| 2:45:29| The zoning would allow the development of a residence as requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9929)|
| 2:45:35| The surrounding land uses are residential or vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| so this would be compatible with surrounding land uses in the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9938)|
| 2:45:46| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9947)|
| 2:45:48| I'd like to make a motion to approve based on MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9956)|
| 2:45:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9958)|
| 2:45:59| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9959)|
| 2:46:00| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| 2-C-18-RC is request of vertex development for rezoning from agricultural to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9963)|
| 2:46:11| at a density up to nine dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| Property located west side of Breakable Road, northwest of Strawberry Plains Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9984)|
| 2:46:27| I'd like to report from the MPC staff from Dr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9993)|
| 2:46:37| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 12-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9997)|
| 2:46:40| to recommend zoning at a density of nine dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| The zoning would be compatible with the sector plan designation for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| which allows medium density residential and office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| The property with its location near the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| and adjacent to higher density commercial use is appropriate for the medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10018)|
| 2:47:03| Staff recommended zoning at a density of 12 units per acre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| The Planning Commission, after discussion and hearing from the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10027)|
| 2:47:11| reduced that to nine dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| Both staff and Commission feel that this is the appropriate place for the medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10034)|
| 2:47:19| and it would serve a good purpose here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| It's served by two collector streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| and is adjacent to the commercial development at the Strawberry Plains interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10043)|
| 2:47:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| I would like to speak for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| I noticed it kind of unusual for the staff to make a recommendation larger in density than the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10057)|
| 2:47:47| but I see that the MPC commissioners went with the applied for number, which is nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10067)|
| 2:47:55| But let me read another paragraph out of paragraph seven, and this is reading from your recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10075)|
| 2:48:09| Both collector streets have inadequate pavement widths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10089)|
| 2:48:12| so road improvements, including widening, may be required to accommodate the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10092)|
| 2:48:21| And reading further, but paraphrasing, there may be two or three outlets of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10101)|
| 2:48:27| because this is 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| The nine units per acre would have been 1,208,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| but the nine is recommended that is before us is only 906 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10115)|
| 2:48:42| With two or three accesses on Break Bull Road and Hammer Road, which are deemed maybe inadequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10122)|
| 2:48:53| I've traveled through there this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| They are inadequate in those certain stretches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10135)|
| 2:49:00| Will the proposed improvements be looked at and required through the planned residential development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10140)|
| 2:49:10| The development of that density would require a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10150)|
| 2:49:17| That study would likely identify improvements to Break Bull and Hammer Road that would be required of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10157)|
| 2:49:25| In fact, discussing this, one of the reasons staff recommended 12 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10165)|
| 2:49:31| was feeling that that additional density would provide profit that could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10171)|
| 2:49:36| Some of that money could be used to pay for the improvements to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| which would be required of the developer without adversely impacting the potential for the development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10180)|
| 2:49:47| Okay, and then I would comment to my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| Break Bull Road is one of two roads in the whole of the 8th District that I have said need improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10191)|
| 2:50:00| Break Bull Road needs to be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| and I think this development will add to my argument with the administration in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10203)|
| 2:50:10| that there be a review of Break Bull Road and improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10210)|
| 2:50:15| Maybe this will be another occurrence of, as fellow Commissioner Schoonmaker commented earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10215)|
| 2:50:24| where the developer in Knox County get together and improve roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10224)|
| 2:50:30| And having said that, I move that this be approved per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10230)|
| 2:50:38| I have a question for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10238)|
| 2:50:42| Given what you've heard from the MPC staff and the requirements that may be required of you in road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| is the nine units an acre adequate for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10249)|
| 2:50:53| First of all, Steve Bethel, 226 Castle Downs Lane, Knoxville, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10253)|
| 2:51:01| Our request, or going back before the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| would be that we would prefer to be able to work with the 12 units per acre that the staff recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| because we don't know what these costs are, we don't know what the traffic impact study is going to return back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10270)|
| 2:51:16| If we just say nine units an acre is adequate for us, at this point in time we don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10276)|
| 2:51:22| Isn't that what you applied for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| We did apply for nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| As we move forward with this and heard from the staff that we may also be looking to improve Hammer Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10289)|
| 2:51:36| we may end up having to do all of that through Breakville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10296)|
| 2:51:41| So as that kind of grew on us, we also would prefer to be able to go back to the 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10301)|
| 2:51:49| We came in and said yes to the nine because that's kind of where the vote was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10309)|
| 2:51:56| But again, we don't know what that impact cost is going to be at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10316)|
| 2:52:02| It was my understanding that MPC staff recommended 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10325)|
| 2:52:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10326)|
| 2:52:07| And so you're saying you get to the MPC meeting and the MPC commissioners negotiate towards nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10327)|
| 2:52:12| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10332)|
| 2:52:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10333)|
| 2:52:14| Is that a true representation, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10334)|
| 2:52:15| There was not much objection, I believe, at that time from the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10335)|
| 2:52:19| because they hadn't calculated all the potential costs associated with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10339)|
| 2:52:29| What's your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10349)|
| 2:52:32| My motion will stand as approving as recommended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10352)|
| 2:52:40| Have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10360)|
| 2:52:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10366)|
| 2:52:47| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10369)|
| 2:52:54| Is there any other business to come before the zoning board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| If not, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=10378)|
