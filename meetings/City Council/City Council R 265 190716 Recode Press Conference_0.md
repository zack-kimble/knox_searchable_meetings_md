| 0:00:30| Well, good morning everyone, and thank you all for being here. I will read my remarks and then I'll be open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=30)|
| 0:00:37| answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=37)|
| 0:00:39| So, in early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=39)|
| 0:00:42| 2017, the City of Knoxville began a public planning process known as Recode Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| which is a comprehensive update of our zoning code. The current code was adopted 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=47)|
| 0:00:53| It has been amended, added to, and tweaked ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| It is often difficult for the average person to make sense of it, and it often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| discourages the kind of quality development that people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| We took on the task of reorganizing and updating our zoning code to make it easier for residents to understand and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| for developers to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| When the current code was written, there was an emphasis on suburban development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| resulting in a sprawled, less efficient pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| Times have changed, and people want more choices like mixed-use developments along corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| more affordable housing, and options for business creation and commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| People also want to protect the character of our single-family neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| while allowing for apartments and housing units that meet the needs of family members and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=102)|
| 0:01:49| All indications are that our population will continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| Our challenge is to grow in a way that meets the changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| complex, and different needs of current and future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| The Recode process has been led by Knoxville-Knox County Planning staff, a shout-out to Gerald and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| along with numerous city staff, a team of experienced consultants, and a broadly representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| 20-member Stakeholder Advisory Committee, members who are here with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| Their patience and hard work moving this transparent public process forward deserves recognition and praise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| and I want to thank every one of them who have led this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| There's a reason why cities and mayors choose to comprehensively update their zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| only every 50 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| Zoning, by its very nature, is contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| Zoning considers your rights as a property owner to use and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| enjoy your property, and balances your rights with the rights of your neighbors to not be negatively impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=174)|
| 0:03:02| Zoning creates a roadmap to achieve shared community goals related to development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| sustainability, and quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Zoning is the poster child for my favorite maxim, and you may have heard me say this, that good and reasonable people often disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=193)|
| 0:03:21| If our current zoning code, the one we are currently implementing, was up for a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| I can guarantee you you'd see the same level of debate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| unfortunately mistrust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| that we have seen with RECO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| But what I have also seen with RECO is a massive engagement of people from all parts of Knoxville who have talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| debated, and yelled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Then listened to one another and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| compromised to bring us to where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| The public engagement process has included more than 90 public workshops, two hearings before the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=234)|
| 0:04:02| a mailing to all property owners, I think nine stakeholder committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| seven City Council workshops, and two City Council meetings so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| Staff and council members have engaged in hundreds of additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| neighborhood meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| individual meetings, and phone calls throughout this planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| RECO is the most thorough and transparent public engagement process Knoxville has ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| Nevertheless, there are still some lingering misperceptions about RECO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| For example, this is not a massive rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| Though the names of zones have changed, the vast majority of properties will be subject to the same rules under the new code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| under the new name, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| they are under the present code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Where a property zone has changed, it's typically been at the request of the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| or to protect the character of the existing neighborhood, or to bring zoning in line with current use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=302)|
| 0:05:10| In any case, and this is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| no property owner will be forced to change the property's use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| All current uses will be allowed to continue to be grandfathered in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| unless the use is abandoned and not actively marketed for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| Strong property rights remain in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| RECO will not raise your taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| Rather, RECO will allow and encourage investment that grows the tax base and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| eases the pressure on existing homeowners and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| So modernizing the zoning code requires compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| We're always kind of aiming for that sweet spot in the middle. As a result, the RECO ordinance has gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=350)|
| 0:05:58| five drafts. The accompanying zoning map has gone through four drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| All drafts and related materials can be found at RECODENOXVILLE.COM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| So this past May, RECO transitioned from the planning stage to the policy stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| That's when we moved it to City Council. It is now City Council's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| to make the final decisions that weigh and balance the diverse interests expressed through RECO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| And at that time, I said there will be no more drafts of the map. There will be no more drafts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| the text of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Draft four of the map is what Council will work off of, and draft five of the text is what Council has been working off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=396)|
| 0:06:45| So during two lengthy meetings so far, City Council carefully reviewed the ordinance page by page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| and word by word. They have engaged in substantive dialogue and listened to more public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=412)|
| 0:07:01| Numerous amendments remain and all documents are online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| Now City Council meets in regular session tonight and will again review the proposed RECO ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| There likely will be more detailed discussion and more amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| I don't know what the outcome will be. We will go as far as we can tonight, and we've already outlined the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| Council meeting which is July 30th, and then meetings in August are scheduled as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| But I can tell you there isn't another City Council in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| more prepared to deal with these types of issues, are more committed to a careful review and balanced solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=455)|
| 0:07:43| Once passed, RECO Knoxville will be a living document, like the code before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| It will always be subject to amendment as improvements are identified or as times or desired development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| patterns change. So I encourage all Knoxvillians to support this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| This has been a good process, and I encourage you to support City Council as they finalized RECO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| So that's the end of my prepared remarks, and I'm glad to answer any questions that the media might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| And if I can't answer them, I'll call on our remarkable staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| Are there any specific issues that you think will be brought up tonight at City Council? Any outstanding issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| Yes, and I walked away without my worksheets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| but there are online, there are staff-initiated worksheets that show staff-initiated changes based on additional input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=511)|
| 0:08:44| talking to individuals, what staff is recommending, and there's a council-initiated worksheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| I know that the Hillside Protection Overlay is up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=529)|
| 0:09:00| A planning commission may change from what the council had voted on, so I know that will be back up before council to discuss that as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=540)|
| 0:09:10| Gerald, do you want to help me with some others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| The functional family definition, the restrictions on functional families have become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| So that's the issues of who is a functional family in terms of who can live in a home, in a house, in a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| That is being brought up again as well. That has already been discussed by council and likely to be discussed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| Here is, these are the council-initiated amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| As council worked, literally word by word, through the documents in prior meetings, our staff documented every vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=582)|
| 0:09:53| We put it on these worksheets and you can see exactly what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| We wanted everyone to know exactly if you can't be at the meetings, and praise to those folks who have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=598)|
| 0:10:06| If you can't be at it, you can find out exactly what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| These are the staff-initiated changes in blue, often because of discussions that come out of the meetings or the additional public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=610)|
| 0:10:23| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| Those are two examples I'm sure that we've gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| For a lot of people that we've heard from online and things like that, our viewers, they feel like this has come as a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| In the last two or three months, we've had these big, huge city council meetings where people have been and started showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=635)|
| 0:10:42| They feel like this has been a surprise to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| What would you say to them, knowing that you all have worked on this process for the last two years, what would you say to those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| For two and a half years, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| For those who are just finding out, I say go to the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| We have been working on it for two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| Your interests have been represented throughout these two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| Whether you're from the business community or whether you live in a neighborhood, whether you support more affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| it is more than likely that your interests, even though you are still hearing about it, your interests have been represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| maybe by your neighborhood association or your civic group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| We have had a very diverse process, a lot of different people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| We've heard from people from all over the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| Even though you might just be hearing about it, more than likely, folks like you have been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| You can find everything that's been done on the website, RecodeKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| All the drafts, all the meetings, the background, FAQs, all of it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=703)|
| 0:11:51| Now, I know that for some people who say, this passes tonight or whenever this would be voted on and finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| Will there be a process for people to say, hey, after looking at this, after reading through all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| I don't think this is the right zone for me and my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Is there going to be a chance for them to come back to city council and say, hey, after this is all said and done, the dust settles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| this is not the right zoning for my property. Is there going to be a process for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| Gerald, if you want to come up and answer exactly how that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| As I said, this is a living document, just as the one we're using now has been amended over the years and zonings have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| This will also be a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Unfortunately, this council will still have to deal with zonings and the code for the length of their terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=751)|
| 0:12:40| So, would you talk about the process of somebody, after this has passed, if somebody needs to, does not agree with their zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=760)|
| 0:12:49| And with zoning changes, a legislative process would require a review by the Planning Commission and action by the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| The city council has to implement, add it to the code itself, a provision for a comparable zone request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| And that request would be received with no application fee. We would move it through the process as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| And that period of time is two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| So, two years after the adoption of the code, if there is a property owner who feels that there is a comparable zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| a zone more comparable to their previous zone that was assigned, they could request that change or amendment with no application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| And again, we would move it through the process as quickly and efficiently as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| And if there is an amendment, the wording, if that property owner feels the wording is not correct, that same process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| but because of the stakeholder committee, one council member, well-achieved, has been a member of the council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| and has sponsored a resolution to allow the stakeholder committee to continue for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| We would take that proposed amendment to the stakeholder committee, but then move it on through the Planning Commission and the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| And that resolution is on the agenda tonight to extend the stakeholder committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| Mayor, are you hoping for a vote tonight? Hoping for a final vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| I am hoping that council continues to move this forward. I look forward to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| I am not going to say when that vote will be. Remember what happens is that we are having votes every meeting, right, on the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=858)|
| 0:14:27| The text part of the document has to be approved on two readings. The zoning map needs to be approved on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=867)|
| 0:14:37| So until those get both, and neither one goes into effect unless and until both of them are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=877)|
| 0:14:46| So what I'm hoping is that we continue to have a very thorough discussion, that amendments are made and votes are taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=886)|
| 0:14:56| and when we get to the point where those are, when council is satisfied that we have done what we need to do for recode at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=896)|
| 0:15:05| knowing that it is a living document, then yes, I'm looking forward to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| I don't know if that will be a vote on first reading. I'd love to see it tonight, but I don't know if we can get there with the amount of discussion we still need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| Madam Mayor, can you maybe elaborate more on how this is affecting future development of properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| Current property owners, you know, the zoning really isn't going to be changing a lot for those people who currently have structures or do business on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=924)|
| 0:15:33| Can you maybe elaborate to those people who own property and how this will be for future development on maybe unused property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| Well, I'm going to put somebody on the spot. I'm going to ask one of our developers who is on the planning commission and a stakeholder committee member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| who has been right there seeking that sweet spot, those compromises in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Do you mind talking about the impact on development? Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| I'm Tim Hill. I'm a local developer investor, commercial real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=955)|
| 0:16:04| I would say that one of the biggest benefits would be the flexibility given to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| Instead of having a required 25-foot setback, you may go into CG2 or CG3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=970)|
| 0:16:18| If you see a more pedestrian-friendly community, then you can pull your buildings all the way up to the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=978)|
| 0:16:27| So that would be one big advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| And if you didn't want that, you see more type of a state route, 50-55 miles an hour, and you want to push it back 20-25 feet, get a CG1 zoning, then you have that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=990)|
| 0:16:44| So there's more flexibility in those zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| But maybe for homeowners more specifically than commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| A lot of people are concerned about maybe adding duplexes or high-density housing in maybe those historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| Kind of talk to me a little bit about how those zonings really aren't changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| Right. So again, there's one of the things we have been very tuned into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Many of us live in single-family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| We like our single-family neighborhoods, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| But we also have kids or we have elderly relatives or whatever who need different types of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| And so what we have done through this code is provide for a variety of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| Do you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| I'll try to address your question. I think there were a couple of questions in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Many of our current residential single-family zoning districts allow for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| Either it's a permitted use, as in the R1A, or it's a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| The new code requires a special use permit for a duplex in all the zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| So there's standardization in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| It does allow duplexes to be put on a larger lot size and only through review in a public forum before the planning committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| We've also protected some of those historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Parks and Park Bridge, Oakwood-Lincoln Park, Down Zone R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| which allows between 25 and 30 dwelling units an acre depending on the total number of acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| because of the formula for the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| We've assigned those to single-family zoning designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| So that affordable single-family character is protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| We've fine-tuned our zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| We've fine-tuned our zoning map so those areas that have a duplex or a multi-family within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| are basically a single-family area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| We're trying to cut those out and allow them to continue use with the R4 zoning or R3 small-scale multi-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| but not do a blanket zoning over the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Again, trying to provide opportunities for a range of densities without impacting the single-family character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| The impact on neighborhoods that will, I think, be greatly beneficial is the mixed use and the flexibility along the corridors that Tim Hill talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| But those corridors can redevelop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| They're not just stuck in a 1960s pattern, but in a 21st century pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| Mayor, I've got a question that's not about RICO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1144)|
| 0:19:13| You've done a great job of staying out of the mayor's race, but last night at a candidate forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| one of the candidates, Eddie Maness, said that in 2011, when you were running for mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| that you and him had a conversation, and you asked him to support you, and then he could run in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| Can you confirm that conversation ever occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| I don't remember the conversation the way Eddie does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| Do you remember any conversation in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| I do not recall. I did not commit to supporting him in the 2019 race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| Thank you very much, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| But because of the way you asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| I'm still rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| But because of the way you asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Eddie did a great job with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| India Kincannon did a great job working with us at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| And Marshall Stairs did a great job with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| I'm not taking a position in the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| But I would respectfully disagree with my good friend, Eddie, about what was said back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| And that's the reason I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Because I know you've done a phenomenal job of staying out of the mayor's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| But when your name was inferred last night, I felt like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| That there was a responsibility of myself to make sure that you're on the record to either confirm or deny what was said by your name being referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1224)|
| 0:20:33| Thank you for that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Uber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Are you committed to getting a repo done before you leave office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| That will be up to council, obviously, to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| But yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| And we're very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| I think it's important to note this started with the previous council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| And I know I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| I don't want to speak for my colleagues that were elected at the same time as me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| I was talking about this at every door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| And it was on my wall card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| So this is not something newly talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| The council prior to us was voting on this while we were campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| It was a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| It was a discussion topic at our forums as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| So many folks ran on this knowing that this was something that they would take up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| And they would do the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| I specifically ran on that because of something that Mr. Hill spoke to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| is the barriers to development along corridors like Broadway and Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| My neighborhoods along that, which are fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| you have to jump through a lot of hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| You have to pay for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| It slows down your process for your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| It makes you pay extra fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| It makes you go to extra meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| You have to get different zoning that has no height restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| and doesn't accommodate for the neighborhoods surrounding you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| So we have large swaths of areas zoned around Fort McGill, Old North,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| up and down Broadway and Central that don't have the considerations that this recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| the zoning in the recode process is allowing for better development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| that considers the neighborhoods surrounding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| So I talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| So this isn't new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| We all talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| And just to further respond, Hubert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| I feel a responsibility to complete this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| And when you think about, I have been in office for seven and a half years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| I have, working with my team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| I understand better than any new person walking into this role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| understand the good and the bad of the current zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| having worked with our team, with our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| These council members, both those who are term limited like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| they also have seven and a half years' experience of why this needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| And as Councilwoman Ryder said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| this was a topic of discussion when they ran in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| So we all really have a responsibility to bring this process to a close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| and to make the very best decisions we can and then move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| Explain the December ordinance that waived the city's obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| to give 120 days notice before a comprehensive zoning update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Well, I will call on the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| There was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| That is a fallacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| The claim out there that we changed the notification requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| for comprehensive zoning updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| If you look at the, I looked at this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| First of all, contrary to what has been said in the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| that vote was done in two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| It was not an emergency reading as planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| It was done in two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Full transparency at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| There was no opposition raised by anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| The current, and you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| but the previous language was basically silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| There was no requirement that there be the mailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| for a comprehensive, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| there's no requirement for a comprehensive update like we're doing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| that all property owners be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| That was not a requirement in the previous code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| We clarified that so there wouldn't be this misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| However, despite that, we still did a massive mailing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| to all property owners to make sure that they were aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| that we were undergoing a comprehensive update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| and that there was a number to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Over 350 or so people decided to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Many more, I'm sure, went to the website as directed in the mailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| That is one of the misperceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| and some of the misinformation that is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| Thank you for asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Did I answer that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| Again, I want to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| I want to thank, again, thank the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| all of the staff I've mentioned, for planning, city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| the stakeholders committee, the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| for this unbelievable work that they have done to get us this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| We're not finished yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| As we said, the stakeholder committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| which is a 20-member, broadly representative committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| they will continue to meet for at least two more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| and if needed, that will get extended by a future council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| I want to thank this council for the work they have put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| to really make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Here's the beauty about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| For those who are extreme critics of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| everybody disagrees with this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| and that's what we work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| There are some extreme critics out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| They are not the ones that have been in the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| They are not the ones that have been crafting the compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| They are not the ones that have actually been sitting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| and debating what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| It's very easy to cast dispersions on a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| that, as I've said, by its very nature is contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| I've said this often as a mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| The easiest thing is to criticize and to tear down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| That is so simple and that is so lame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| The hardest thing is to make something new happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| The hardest thing is to build community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Through this process, we are building community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| We are preparing our community for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| We are holding on to that which we know works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| and that we care about, that we value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| and we are also changing our regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| so that we can address the needs of others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| for that stuff that's not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| and that we can address the future needs of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| and our children and grandchildren, our future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| Those who have been at the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| if they criticize something, I'm like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| okay, I hear you. Let's talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| But those who don't attend the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| who haven't once picked up the phone to call me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| or to call council or to call Gerald about this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| but yet they write column after column after column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| that is negative and dogs this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| that's lame. That's really lame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716recodepressconference?start=1682)|
