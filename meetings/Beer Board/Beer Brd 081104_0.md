| 0:00:55| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| Fire prevention approval is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| No, I'll just comment that they lack their fire inspection, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=67)|
| 0:01:13| because they have to get their equipment installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Yeah, I was going to ask Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| there were some questions at the last beer board about the zoning on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| Do you want to just speak briefly to the answer on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| I looked at that pretty carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| and after looking at it, it is clear to me that this type of commercial operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| lies very squarely within the type of permitted uses that are permitted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| The package store itself is not included in those permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| but you have to look at the definition of package store in your regular dictionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| because it's not defined either in the RP1 section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| or in any other section of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| If you look at that, it falls very squarely within the types of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| that are listed among the permitted uses under SC1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| which is referred to by the RP1 section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| Beyond that, I could not say whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| or not they meet all the qualifications for RP1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| but that's really not the job of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| That's the job of the zoning inspections unit to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| But it is clearly a use that falls squarely within those uses that could be permitted in RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081104?start=149)|
