| 0:02:50| There will be a public meeting on broadband internet access downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| This really came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Some folks who live downtown started raising the issue on Facebook, actually, and a lot of us got involved in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| And so we are going to have this meeting to talk about that with some of the providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| and interested individuals and companies downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| So this, again, will be Thursday, April 4th at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| It's really being hosted by the Entrepreneur Center, which is at 17 Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| which will be opening the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| And we think we may have to move the meeting upstairs to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| So come to 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| Have we officially moved it upstairs yet, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| So it's at 17 Market Square at the Entrepreneur Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| But if necessary, we'll move it upstairs to the chamber where they have a larger office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| The second public meeting, the same night, on Thursday, April 4th at 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| we have a public meeting on the form-based code for the Cumberland Avenue District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| This will be at the UT Federal Credit Union, 2100 White Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| The Office of Redevelopment will host this meeting to review proposed changes to the current zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| for the Cumberland Avenue area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| And we have been working with some consultants called Code Studio out of Austin, Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| who will be on hand and will be an opportunity for comments and questions about the new form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| So, of course, this meeting is open to the general public, and everyone is welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| And then the next day, on Friday, we have the official ribbon-cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| and opening of the Knoxville Entrepreneur Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| That will be at 4 o'clock at the center, which is 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| You all know that the Entrepreneur Center is really an initiative led by the city with several partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| including the Industrial Development Board and the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| And we have several, you know, very great funding partners that we'll be talking about that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| The center will be a place where aspiring entrepreneurs can turn their ideas into reality and be free to dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| It's going to help Knoxville develop, attract, and retain our next generation of businesses and business leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| So I hope all of you will come out and join us Friday at 4 o'clock as they're setting up for the Dogwood Arts Festival as it starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=306)|
| 0:05:16| Also, this week, we've had several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| We've already had – I've been at two events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| I know there have been more already for Community Development Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| and we've got some more that I'll tell you about in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| This was really kind of kicked off on March 25th when we had the Neighborhood Conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| where there were over 500 or so people that attended at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| I think all of council was there except one person who had to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| But this was a wonderful gathering of neighborhood representatives and community leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| city and county officials, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| So we really want to thank David Massey and Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| and all the other folks that worked so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| A lot of volunteers in our Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| Many folks worked hard to make it such a huge success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| But right afterwards, just a very short break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| and then all of a sudden Community Development jumped into the National Community Development Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| Actually, I want to invite – I see the Community Development Department is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Please stand up and kind of come up around the podium, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| so we can see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| This is the new Community Development uniform, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| They're not pro-Louisville, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| So I'm going to read this as they're coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| This year's theme for National Community Development Week is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Changing Communities, Changing Lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| And it emphasizes several redevelopment areas and projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| We're highlighting many of them this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| You can find out more about it on the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| But I want to tell you that on Wednesday there will be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| tomorrow, April 3rd, at 2 p.m. in Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| we'll have an open house for a newly constructed home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Knox Housing Partnership is our partner in that construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| And the homes – there are actually two homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| They're located at 2110 and 2116 Ohio Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| And then on Thursday morning, I'll be at the Equity Awards Breakfast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| with this wonderful team of employees and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| We will be honoring folks who received the awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| And this is at the All Occasion Catering Facility at 922 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| Great business that moved into the downtown north area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| and that benefited from one of our facade improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Also, on Friday, April 5th, 4 to 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| there's a community development fair with exhibits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=470)|

| 0:07:57| at the Ashley Nicole Playground at Caswell Park on Winona Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| Of course, this event is open and – open to the public and is free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=481)|

| 0:08:28| Councilman Greene isn't allowed to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| They were commenting you're only going to read part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Only part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Oh, they were commenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Just part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Because some of it I've already kind of said about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| But whereas this is – I think is really interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Community – the Community Development Block Grant Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| was enacted into law by President Gerald Ford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| as the centerpiece of the Housing and Community Development Act back in 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| So since 1974, cities in this country have been receiving these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| to try and address issues, trying to develop viable urban communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| by providing decent housing and suitable living environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| and expanding economic opportunities for people of low and moderate income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| The city of Knoxville's Department of Community Development with CDBG funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| Home Partnership Program funds, and Emergency Solution Grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| have provided housing rehab, neighborhood revitalization, human service needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| job creation and retention, and physical redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| all through these last 37 or so years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| Now, we do have a problem because funding has been going down at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| But still, we have this excellent staff that is working very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| to appropriately spend the dollars that we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| We leverage some city dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| And as a result, we see neighborhoods revitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| We see, you know, residential neighborhoods and commercial neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| And I know city council is very familiar with a lot of the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| that we have seen over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| So I'm going to ask Becky to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=600)|

| 0:10:39| to help revitalize neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| and help people have better places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130402?start=641)|
