| 0:00:46| TABC and KPD have conducted some compliance checks that have resulted in some citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=46)|
| 0:00:55| that will require administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=55)|

| 0:01:08| Rumors were cited by TABC, and as soon as we have the paperwork from them, we will move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=68)|
| 0:01:14| to comply with state law, and that would probably lead to a suspension of their license for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| TABC suspended rumors for 10 days and fined the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| On March 16th, the business on Sutherland Avenue, Las Petronas, was operating without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| a permit and sold to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| The business was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=92)|

| 0:02:14| And the one on Cumberland closed during their suspended license time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=138)|

| 0:07:52| All about location, location, location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| A review to go, that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| And the next one is Los Patrones, and this is the one that I mentioned at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=477)|
| 0:08:06| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| They were cited for sale to a minor on the 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| and during the investigation they said the ownership had already changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| and all of their business licenses were hung up under the new name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| The business licenses were under the new name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| But they didn't have a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| And they were sold to a minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Mrs. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| We are lacking the surrender of the former owner's permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Mayor Brown, this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Did you say they sold to a minor under the old name or this name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| We weren't aware at the time we were conducting the compliance check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| that the ownership had in fact changed already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| When we went inside to look for the beer permit, we couldn't find one posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| and that's when we examined the documents that were posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| the city and county business licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| as well as the fire inspection was already posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| and it was posted under the new name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Well, I'll move to approve a pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| I mean, what's the law here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| I mean, they're operating without selling beer without a license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Well, that is a violation of the city ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| and that calls into question their ability to hold a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| under the regulations that govern beer permits and permittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=578)|
| 0:09:47| In the application package for this establishment, there's an affidavit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| and paragraph two of the affidavit says in part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| I understand that all applicants are charged with the responsibility of knowing the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| and state beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| It goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| And so we have an issue concerning their permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| concerning their actions before the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| I mean, that's other than what allegedly happened with a sale to a miner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| In my opinion, it would be within the discretion of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| if they wanted to deny the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| That doesn't mean that the business can't come back at a later date and reapply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| but there are grounds for denial because they sold without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| Are there grounds for civil penalties for that or for operating and selling beer without a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| Well, there can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| And the reason why I say can and not there shall be is because this, as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| this investigation happened fairly recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| and has not yet worked its way through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| Sometimes in the discretion of the judge, if this is someone's first violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| they may be put on probation, and if they successfully complete the terms of the probation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| this can be expunged from their record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Other times there becomes a conviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| and there's a specific provision in the city code that would prohibit someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| who has a conviction from obtaining a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| So there can be civil penalties, most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| Do we have the authority to put someone under probation on that should another offense occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| So our options today, well, I guess the last question I have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| how long were they operating without a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| That I personally don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| I don't know if Sergeant Hunter would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| Maybe they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Just looking at the pictures of the business licenses I took,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| the city of Knoxville business license was issued February 22nd of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| So I don't know if they were operating prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| The county business license was issued February 15th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| So that would be about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| About a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| When was the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Just past Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| We have several council members who want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| We also have the applicant who wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Should we listen to the applicant first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| I was going to ask the applicant to tell us what happened and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| My name is Wendy Cornea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| You can pull the microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| That's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| My name is Wendy Cornea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| This is the owner, Janey Abeyta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| I've been with her throughout the whole process of getting the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| La Cueva Bar, the owner, we still had the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| It wasn't until, like, a couple days before they came in into the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| and he was demanding the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| But we were telling him that because we hadn't received the new beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| that, you know, we kind of needed the beer permit to keep the business going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| But the whole process, like, it's been kind of weird because they changed owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| like, in the middle of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Not the middle of this year, but just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Do you know the date that the ownership changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| When was the closing of the sale of the business from Las Cuevas to Las Petronas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| Well, we still – the day that we changed, like, the whole paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| we still had the other beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| My question is, do you know the date that they changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Let's go over here to Councilman DeLavoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Yeah, I wonder if Janey Abeyta can tell us about the purchase and what has transitioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| Is she good with her English?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=853)|
| 0:14:25| Marshall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=865)|
| 0:14:34| Can you speak in the microphone or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| She's just saying, like, during the whole, like, what happened that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| like, the people that were at the door, they're not really, like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| security rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| They're trying to find people that can take care of that, like, search IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| and, like, search other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| And as of that, like, it was just a misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Like, it was an error from our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| And then the person behind the bar, the bartender, like, she misread the number on the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=902)|
| 0:15:09| That's why they sold, you know, the beer to the minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| But it was just an error, like, our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| And we didn't know that we didn't have, like, they didn't know that the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| that we weren't supposed to have the beer permit there because the other owner came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| and just took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| So we didn't know that we were selling illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Well, she signed an affidavit here that says that she knew all of the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| Knoxville alcoholic beverage rules and regulations, and that would have been part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| So she, had she read that, she took the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| and that kind of information was gone over in the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| So she had signed that she knew those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=955)|
| 0:16:12| Well, did she know it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Well, she had a translator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| She had a translator translate that, and she said she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| But she just, you know, misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| Well, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| I want to make sure I understand what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| So they had applied for a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Obviously, they hadn't received one, but they were still selling beer beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| And they sold to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| How is that process supposed to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Well, were they using the old license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| That's what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| No, if I understood correctly, and correct me if I'm wrong, please, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| the permit, which is required to be posted at the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| the former owner physically came in, got the permit, and left with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| He asked her that he wanted the permit because he asked her, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| her to change the names of the business, to do all the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| and he kept calling her, calling her that he wanted the permit back because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| you know, it's La Cueva Bar, and it's not Los Patrones anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| or it's Patrones now, but it's not La Cueva anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| So he wanted all his paperwork back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| The city code requires if there's going to be a change in ownership of greater than 50 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| you have to go through the permit process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| and you're not supposed to be selling beer until you have your new permit in hand, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| And I think that's what's troubling many people tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| And the other side of the coin is when the bar changed hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| he was obligated by law to surrender that permit within 15 days to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| and obviously that was not done either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| So they had the business, the transaction had occurred on February 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| When they changed the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| But the business, the transaction had done ownership to this lady here February 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| So did you sell beer all the way from February 22nd up until when you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| received a permit last Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| She said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Then why that one day then did you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| Well, because there, because the beer, because there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1122)|
| 0:19:11| the beer board meeting was supposed to be today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| That's why she didn't know that, you know, I mean, she was going to get the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| or she thought she was going to get the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| That's why she thought it was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| I have a question, and Sergeant Hunter, perhaps you can help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| You said that there was an incident at La Cueva during the time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| Las Petronas claims they were not selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| Can you tell us about that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| I don't have the, well, correction, I'm pulling up the email now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| There was a shooting at the bar on, give me one second, I'll pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| On March 3rd of this year at about 157 in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| officers responded to a shooting at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Apparently there was an altercation that happened outside when the doorman went to see what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| Shots were fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| He tried to run for cover, and he was shot in the leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| So, yes, it was outside the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| The bar was open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| I wasn't one of the responding officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| so I'd have to speak with them to find out if they were serving alcohol that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| but the bar was open for business that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| I'm going to suggest and then move that we advise this young lady to seek legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| and I'm going to ask that we postpone this application until we get some readback from the hearing process that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| I'm concerned that it doesn't seem that the rules have sunk in or mean that much right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| and I'm concerned that we can't just give them a permit in the face of these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Is there a hearing date for your hearing coming up for your citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| She actually wasn't cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| She wasn't on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| The bartender was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Cited for selling to a minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| And when we were there that night, we asked who was in charge, who the minor was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| and we couldn't really get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| We also asked that the owner respond to the premises, and she didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| And I'm sorry, I missed your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| Beta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Oh, the other lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Wendy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Wendy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| When we were done issuing the citation and were about to leave the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| she showed up to try to translate, and we explained to her exactly what had happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| and she explained to me she represented the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| But up until that point, there didn't seem to be anybody who was actually in charge of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| or that would take that responsibility to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| That's what's troubling to me, and I think it might be prudent for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| and I'll move that we postpone this and recommend this young lady get legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| and try to sort this out, because I just think we've got a problem here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| and I don't know that our rules are fully comprehended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| I don't think they should be selling beer until they get a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| I don't understand what made them think they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| It seems like a stretch to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| They were willing to try to get away with it or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| or just not observant of the rules they learned in the task force and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| I'm troubled by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Let's hear from Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| Madam Chair, in light of the discussion that we've had and the comments from Attorney Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| I'm going to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| I think this particular location, there have been some complaints from some of the neighborhood groups as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| about this location, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| So I'm going to officially withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Approving with documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| So we have that motion withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| You know, we've heard tonight the owners say they thought it was okay to sell beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| because they were going to get the permit today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| That statement makes me feel very uncomfortable about their understanding of how a permit actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| a permit or a license actually works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| And I would move that we deny this and let them reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| I'll withdraw my postponement if that's appropriate, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| So we have a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| I think they need to be clear that they are not to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| They're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Clear it from the police, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| You can't sell beer down there until you get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| We discussed it that night and we discussed it again today before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| So then they would reapply, is that what you're saying, and then they'd be back here when they can reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| And when they're sure they understand the rules and how to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| I'm agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| They go through the whole process, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Yeah, they have to go through the whole process, start over from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| We have a motion to deny, a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Your permit application has been denied, and there will be a point where you are eligible to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| In light of some of the things that have happened, possibly legal advice with a lawyer would be a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| When you said it's a point where we can reapply, when do you know, when can we apply for, like, the next beer board meeting or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1458)|
| 0:24:31| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| You are certainly entitled to apply to any beer board meeting that you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| One thing that the folks in the administration do is they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| go through the process of making sure everything in your application is hopefully in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| because the members of the beer board scrutinize it for each and every applicant that comes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| So I would politely suggest that you have as much of your application as completed as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1497)|
| 0:25:07| and make sure the other most recent issues are also adequately addressed beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| And if someone's going to sign an affidavit that they understand, they really need to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| And the other thing, I'm sure that the police department would not like to be driving by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| and see that you're open for business selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| No, they can sell pretzels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Mimi's Cafe on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| They don't want to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| SWH Mimi Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1543)|

| 0:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| We need the surrender of the former owner's permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| He has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130319_201807?start=1558)|
