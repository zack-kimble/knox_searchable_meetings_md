| 0:00:34| to the stage, I'd request that you lead us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=34)|

| 0:01:06| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=66)|
| 0:01:14| We're now going to talk about the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| First, I would like to amend the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| to add public forum to the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| We will have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| There are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| We will also have public input on an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| later on in the meeting on what has been typically referred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| to as the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| Let me back up to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| These are the items that we will discuss this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| Item 31 on page 10, 47 and 48 on page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=113)|
| 0:02:05| If there is any discussion, these are also pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=125)|
| 0:02:21| There may be no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| This is 78 and 79 on page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| There was a committee meeting earlier this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Those are related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| So those items would be pulled because of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| That's 78 and 79 on page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=156)|
| 0:02:45| Also, item 83 on page 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=165)|

| 0:03:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| And I don't know where they stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| but I guess a question to you is if the people speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| at the public forum, if they wish to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| like on item 83, the safety center, if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| why they're here, should they wait to that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| I have spoken to Lita Meyer, and she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| wishes to speak at the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| I do not know if Crystal Gorley is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Do you wish to speak at public forum or at the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| The item is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| Thank you for bringing that to my attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Also, Tina Sparks, you wish to speak at the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Now, when we get to the item, if I do not call your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| you be sure and stand up to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| Are there other items that we need to take from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=261)|
| 0:04:33| Yes, yes, she's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| I just need to make sure you understand what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| OK, now then, to continue on to the next page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=280)|

| 0:05:18| Now then, did I get item 301 in all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| OK, item 301 is not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| The contract is not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=328)|

| 0:05:35| It's number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=335)|

| 0:07:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| We are now to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Earlier, a couple of weeks ago, Hugh Holt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| asked a question about being able to give a status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| report on Hardin Valley and Gibbs Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| I would like to have those status reports presented now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Mr. Holt, could you give your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| Hugh Holt, Procurement Director, Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=454)|
| 0:07:42| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| I've got both of the design build firms here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| They're architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| And they're going to talk about where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| they're at on each project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| And the reason we're doing so is because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| told you I'd be back after we establish the GMP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| That's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| The GMP at Gibbs will be $23,600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| That's $31,000 less than the not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| That also includes an auditorium that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| wasn't in the original request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| The Hardin Valley Middle School, the GMP is $34,695,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| That's $105,000 less than the not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| Figure again on Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| $23,600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| And we're somewhere north of 30% complete on design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| So I'll get out of the way and let those guys do what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| Who would like to be first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Looks like Denark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| I'm Steve Lucas with Denark Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| And I want to thank you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| of sharing where we're at on the design right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| We've finished our schematic design phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| And I'm going to turn it over to our design partner, Mike Dooley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| with Barbara McMurray, to kind of walk you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| through our design as it stands right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| I'm Mike Dooley, vice president with Barbara McMurray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Architects, 505 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| What I would like to do today is show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| I would like to do today is show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| some images of the Hardin Valley site plan, floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| plans, and exterior renderings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| The first image you see up on the screen is a site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| The site is directly behind the Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| or the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| And what we're doing, you can see two lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| One is a blue line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| The other is a red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| The blue line is a bus route that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| will be directed from the campus of the Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| on a new road being built by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| under a separate contract connecting to our project site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| The red line is vehicular access that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| comes in from Steel Road to the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| and then loops around the front drop-off, which is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| on the side of the building next to the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| and then back out to Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| The building is 170,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| It's two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| We have some site constraints with a steeply sloping site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And then we have a stream that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| in between our site and the Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| So the topography has been somewhat challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| but we've got a nice two-story design in and on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| Let's go on to the floor plan now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| Looking at the first floor plan, in the heart of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| is the gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| And again, this is 170,000 square feet, two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| So on the first floor, we have the gymnasium in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| The lower left corner, that's the orange color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| is the admin wing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| And then to the left of that is the main entrance that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| going out to the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| The area directly north of that in the blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| is the cafeteria with the seating shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| and then the food service area above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| We have the sixth grade along the lower wing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| all the way to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| And then half of the eighth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| occupies the rest of the upper wing and then the other half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| of the upper floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| The area in pink are art classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| and then the area in red are the music facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| Moving up to the second floor, a similar arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=692)|
| 0:11:41| a lot of the spaces drop off at the second floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| to the left, where we have the multi-height spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| for the cafeteria for music and the gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| To the left, in the lower left-hand corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| is the media center that's above the administration wing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| Then to the right, along the classroom wing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| is a full seventh grade wing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| And then to the north of that is the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| of the eighth grade wing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| Next, we'll move on to some of the exterior renderings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| The elevations for the two-story building, what we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| to do is keep with the materials that are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| We have an elementary school and a high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| that are there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| They have two to three different colors of brick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| so we're going to match the brick on those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| We're looking at a palette of materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| that are maintenance-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| We have glass, we have metal panel, and brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| And the next images we see will be actual perspective images,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| as the public will view it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| This view would be from the Hardin Valley Academy parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| behind the Hardin Valley Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| looking across the stream area to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| So we have the main entry to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| and then where you see the buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| we have the bus drop-off, which comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| from the Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| The area you see directly behind that first bus, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| is the administration wing, with the media center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| above that, with entries flanking both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| And then the classroom wing's going off to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| The next image we see will have a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| shot of the main entry, looking back at the vehicular drop-off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| with a courtyard area to the left, a gathering space that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| outside the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=806)|
| 0:13:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| Can I ask, Chairman, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| Yes, Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| On the bus pickup, I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| Will it exit where the cars do, or will it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| circle back around and go out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| The buses will come up from Hardin Valley Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| and then as they are lined up in that exterior view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| let's go up to that site plan, that blue line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| the buses will head back out towards Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Oh, OK, so the same way the cars are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=850)|
| 0:14:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| And then there are improvements right now occurring on Steel Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| to widen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| What was the student count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Was it 1,200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| I'm sorry, it's 1,200 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| Seeing no further questions, Mr. Jeff, are you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| Mr. Holt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| We'll have Roush Construction up next, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| They're building Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Commissioners, my name is Ron Perfetto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| I'm the president of Roush Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| And I'm accompanied by David Collins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| there he is, who is our design partner with McCarty Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| Apple McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| And before I turn it over to him to showcase our design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| I just think it's appropriate to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| to update you where we are with the construction process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| since that's going to be our main focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| is that we are very close to ending the permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| We hopefully will have a grading permit sometime this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| We are mobilizing on site with equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| and we'll start our stormwater prevention plan also this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| Knox County has given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| So basically, we have started as we speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| which we're very proud of as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Thanks, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| My name's David Collins, McCarty Hills Apple McCarty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Architects, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| We're on the design side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| And so let me just kind of walk you through the Gibbs Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| School site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| There's a lot of similarities between our project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| and the Hardin Valley project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| A couple of the differences are is our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| is being designed for 800 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| We've got about 145,000 square feet in our building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| so it's a little bit smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| But it has a lot of the same components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I guess the one thing that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| able to add to our project that Mr. Holt mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| was we were able to add a 600-seat auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| to the program at the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| So that's one of the main differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| between the two projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Looking at the site, this is a pointer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| I stole from a middle school kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| and it's just not working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| So I'll just try to describe what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| The dotted line to the left, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| see the Gibbs High School and the Gibbs Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| And that's a tassel pipe that splits between those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| And our building is back behind the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| And our site circulation is, because the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| starts obviously at 830 and the elementary school's at 745,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| we're going to utilize the car queuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| drive for our bus access up to the middle school site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| And then there's a new roadway that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| coming off of tassel pipe that will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| and you can see that at the bottom of the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| It's got the green dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| That's a new road that will be the vehicular, the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| students that will be coming in and circling through the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| for a drop-off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| So again, similar to the Hardin Valley project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| we separated our bus traffic from our car traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| both entering and exiting the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| And so we hope that allows for a very clean circulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| We have a one-story building, and so our design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| is a little bit easier to deal with programmatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| We've got everything on one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| And so I think that's helped us through the design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| We basically have two building masses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| you can see on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| And you can see how the parking wraps its way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| around the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| The building on the lower end of the image,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| that's the core services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| That's where the gymnasium, the auditorium, media center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| cafeteria, school administration is in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| And then the component that's on the upper side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| of the diagram, that's the classroom wing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| or the classroom building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| This is a more straightforward plan of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| Again, you can see the different components in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Again, the kind of bluer shaded areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| on the lower part of the image are the core programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| And again, in the middle, you can see it's number 04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| That's the auditorium that we've been able to add to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| And we think that'll be a great thing for the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| They're in dire needs of an auditorium component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| for that school component there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| And this will be a nice add for those community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Again, we're servicing 800 children in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| And we're able to accommodate that pretty easily on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| I think we've got about 250 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| So I think we've got adequate parking involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| for any of the program elements that happen either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| during school and particularly after school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| with gymnasium basketball games and presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| and community activities up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| Looking at building elevations, much like the Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| Academy, we're looking at very durable type of products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| very similar type of products, brick, metal siding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| aluminum windows, and so things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| have a lot of good maintenance-free types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| of characteristics to the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| And again, something that should last you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| a long, long time from a building sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| We've got a couple of images.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| This would be looking at the drop-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| This is actually the drop-off adjacent to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| the buses would pull in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| This would be you'd be entering the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| on that side between the media center and the gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| And then the next slide shows, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| that's looking at the school more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| from the main front entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| That's the gymnasium with the big blue G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| And that would be the drop-off point for your car riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| The entry point there to the left of the G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| that's where the school administration would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| And just give you an overall look of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| A couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Really just, I've heard a lot of talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| about the width of hallways in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| What is the, it looks like you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| got two different widths, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| maybe three going there at Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| What is the average, or what is the width of those hallways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1266)|
| 0:21:06| Yeah, the typical width is 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Now we've got one hallway, the main corridor going down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| the main circulation spine is 14 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Because we're going to have a lot of kids going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| and forth, you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| The main spine that's going up and down the sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| that's going to be 14 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| And the cross corridors that you see, some of them are 10 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| and some of them are 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| And Hugh, what's the same answer to that for Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| If you can, back up in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| It would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| It's part of a school standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| OK, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1304)|
| 0:21:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Is the corridor that connects the classrooms to the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| areas enclosed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Seeing no further questions of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Mr. Holt, do you have closing remarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| The third item of public forum today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| will be new incoming superintendent of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1339)|
| 0:22:29| school system, Mr. Buzz Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| Mr. Thomas, you have to give your official name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| OK, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Buzz Thomas, interim superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Is that OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1365)|
| 0:22:45| That's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| First of all, let me thank you for allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| me to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| I'm honored to be in this work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| I know most all of you personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| and appreciate your commitments to educational excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| In fact, our big goal that we will be focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| in the coming months is one you set for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| to become the best school system in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| One of the first things I did last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| was check to see how we're doing in our quest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| to be the best in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| And I learned something very encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| that I will pass along to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| A lot of people consider Charlotte, North Carolina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| to have the best school system, big school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| system in the South, Charlotte Mecklenburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| and their good school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| And they've won a lot of national awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| But I can tell you that we have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| surpassed them in academic performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| We have a better ACT rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| We have a better graduation rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| And we're outperforming them in math and in reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| And you're going to really like this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| We're doing it for less money than they're spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| So our sights are set on Austin, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| They are outperforming us, but hopefully not for long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| I issued an open letter today that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| has been sent to you that outlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| in a kind of general fashion my plans and priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| I have also given you a hard copy of that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| I hope you'll look it over, think it over, call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| email me if you have thoughts or suggestions or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| I would love to hear them and to really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| what I would describe as a partnership with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| We're in this work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| And we will succeed or fail together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| And I'm resolved that we are going to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| And we're going to succeed famously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| So thank you for letting me be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| Mr. Chairman, I'll be happy to respond to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Seeing no questions, Commissioner Oyenbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| No questions, just want to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Congratulations on your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| And I wish you all the luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| And if there's anything I can do, I'll be glad to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| I think there's going to be something for all of us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| If you have not yet volunteered as a reading tutor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| in the Mayor's Leaders for Readers program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| I hope you'll sign up for that at the Great Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1531)|
| 0:25:31| We are going to have an all hands on deck approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| to reading in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Seeing no further questions or comments of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1541)|

| 0:27:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Dwight Vandevee, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Also here today is Ashley Burnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| the Executive Vice President of the Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| We are pleased to report to you on item 416 and 417| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| that we are in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| I expect they probably have to be contemplated separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| but we have worked with Julie Dupree, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| is the current president of the Home Builders Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Mr. Burnett, Rocky Smith and Scott Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Josh Sanderson, a gentleman from Ball Homes whose name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| quite frankly, escapes me at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| But through a series of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| we have agreed at a square footage rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| that we think more currently reflects market conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| for Knox County, Tennessee, and that we'll bring our permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| fees up to a level where we are closer to self-sustaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| but not so high that it causes hardship on the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| We, in addition to the negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| on the amount per square foot, we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| agree that it would make sense to change the implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| date until August 1st rather than July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| and the material that you have should reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| Beyond that, I'd be glad to answer any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| but really, I would want to publicly thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Mr. Burnett, Mr. Davis, Ms. Dupree, and also our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Roy Braden, Debbie Tibbs, and Randy Lilly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| who have worked a lot of hours to get us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| As we move to discussion, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Are there questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| So basically, I think before you based it on 2,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| what the fee was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| So it would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| We've actually used a model in our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| with the home builders of 2,501 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| And under the existing system, that permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| was a permit that was approved by the city of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| was around $571.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| Under the new system, in our initial discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| with the home builders, they had expressed a preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| for $68 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| We asked them to consider $70 for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| Some involve simplicity for IT and the calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| that they have to run, because the back office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| piece of this is actually much more complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| for Mr. Moran's people than we really give them credit for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| And also, it bumped our numbers slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| So the home builders were agreeable to that $70| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| a square foot figure, and that permit will be $843.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| It's a pretty significant increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| It's about a 47% increase from where we presently are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| But everybody was in agreement that since we hadn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| had an increase in 22 years, that it was not out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Chris is on the, I actually got a question for Benny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Benny might be able to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1826)|
| 0:30:35| I guess my question, Chris, is the budget that we passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| reflected a certain amount of increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Now the budget, the increase is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| So what do we need to do with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| what do we need to do in regards to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| This year, what DeWitt is proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| gets us to that budget number, and will make us whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| on that, on the budget for FY17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1874)|

| 0:31:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| Motion is properly before us for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Mr. Vandevee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Mr. Chairman, if I could call to your attention the handout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| that Jill had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| There's a chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| One side says building valuation data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| and then the back side has an actual chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| with construction types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| If you will see at the bottom, Mr. Braden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| has footnoted that chart to reflect the $70 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| So it's clearly established, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| wanted to make sure that was entered into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| While you peruse that, are there any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1938)|

| 0:33:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1998)|
| 0:33:18| The Insolvency Committee met on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| and we agreed with staff that this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| the best method for disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| I think you all, if you look at your attachment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| you have those properties listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| So we recommended approval of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2011)|

| 0:33:43| There's a or in here, and I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| it's public auction or negotiated sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Are we going to use both of them based on the right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Based on where the property sits and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2030)|

| 0:34:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Item number 79 is a resolution concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| taxes and disposal of surplus real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| owned by the city of Knoxville, resolution 806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Similarly, we met on this issue, and as it was explained to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| basically the property falls to whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| has the most indebtedness on this property in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2076)|
| 0:34:36| So oftentimes, their properties, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| just makes more sense for the city to take ownership of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| As the example I think Ben gave us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| was that there's one in the middle of Williams Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| in the flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| So in all those situations, those go to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| and it's just an iterative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| And they seem to work very well with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| in getting these properties disposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| So I also recommend, and the committee recommends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| approval of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| That's a form of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| That is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Seeing no further discussion or questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| On page 25, item number 83 is a resolution requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| the Knox County Purchasing Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| to issue a request for proposals, RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| for a safety center in Knox County with the scope of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| to be included in the RFP to be provided by resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I make a motion that we send forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| And this is the item that we have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| Is there an order in which you all would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2164)|
| 0:36:28| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| My name is Tina Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| I live at 612 Avenue A in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| And I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| What does that mean, what Mr. Brown just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| We will take up full discussion of this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| at the stated meeting next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| We still accept your input, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2213)|
| 0:36:53| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| OK, well, I know this has been around for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Nobody knows that better than you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| I think the need has been since the 80s, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| Because I know I see in the resolution that the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| center, the RFP, is requested because of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| and I went on to the resolution, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| because of a case that was a lawsuit back in the 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| with Mr. Carver versus this county, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| because it was with his amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| cruel and unusual punishment, because of the overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| So this is not a new issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| But that was like 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| And I'm just wondering, I know it's taken a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| And you all have worked very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Some of you have been on it from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| And once it gets started, and I also saw in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| that it's a proposed, does that mean that, do we know where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| Have you all had a chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Is there a place, a physical place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| It makes sense to me that if, of course, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| architect or anything like that, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| would make more sense to use a structure that's already here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| rather than build from the ground up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| save you time, save you money, save lives, save time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| So I'm just wondering about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I'm sure that that's part of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| you all will be talking about, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| whether it is more practical to do that than to build something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| from the ground up, if that were the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Now, I know that Mayor Burchett has said in a newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| article from back in May that he hoped that this project would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| be resolved by the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Does that sound like something that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| are looking towards as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Because I know he said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| And I realize that the funding that we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| were expecting from the governor has not come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| Is that a possibility, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Is that a done deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| What about these other counties in the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| that may, for whatever reason, want to bring their friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| here, maybe on the QT, could their arrangements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| be made for the surrounding counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| to put some money into the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| I mean, if they want a piece of this pie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| they've got to pay for their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| So time is of the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| I know you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| And too many people have already fallen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| And we just can't afford to lose any more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| because we just can't afford to lose any more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| And I guess that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Well, I do hope that when we do start talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| when you all start talking, that part about nonviolent crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2429)|
| 0:40:40| we've got to address those friends with mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| homeless, and you may have committed some kind of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| Because when you are mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| you are prone to do things that are not standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| And you may do something that is considered a violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| I don't know the definition of violent crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| but I know you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| And I just think that we cannot forget those friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Where will they go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| What will happen to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| No one can be turned away from this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| No one should be turned away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| And I know you all don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| I appreciate everything you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| But you know, this has been going on for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| So many people have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| We can't afford to let anybody else die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Thank you, Ms. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Commissioner Orenby, do you have a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| or do you just want to kind of speak a little bit of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| she was saying, is that I'm glad that the two mayors have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| decided to go forward with this, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| of what the state did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Because we have to take care of our own here in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| And I think that's the reason we're moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| with the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| We'll discuss it more next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| And hopefully, by the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| we can have everything ironed out and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| That's my hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| I don't want to speak ahead of myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| because I don't know what's going to happen next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| or month after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| But it is our wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| And I know a lot of the members up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| is that we do get this solved and get it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| Thank you, Commissioner Orenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Lydia Meyer, are you the next presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| It's Lyda Meyer and 4721 Clark Drive, Knoxville, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2552)|
| 0:42:42| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| It's been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| It feels great to see the progress on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| At this point in time, it feels like such a drop in the bucket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| to have 25 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| But they're only for three days instead of the average of 43| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| nationally for mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| So it works out a little better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| But probably half the people in the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| have mental illness nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| 60% of jail inmates reported symptoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| of mental health disorders in the prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| in the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Serious mental illness, such as bipolar disorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| schizophrenia, major depression affects about 15% of men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| in the jails and 31% of women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| 72% also have a substance abuse disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| And they're often poor and homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| 83% did not receive mental health care after admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| And I know locally, I believe we now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| have three mental health workers in the Knox County Jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| It's up recently from two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| And there's not much that they can do other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| than intake and paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| There's very little direct care that they can give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| There's just not nearly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| So we absolutely need this alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| The lack of treatment in the jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| contributes to a worsening of the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| It's chaotic, bright lights, noisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| They're often victims of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| They are much more likely to be put in solitary confinement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| And it's part of a vicious cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| When they do get out, and like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| they spend an average of 43 days instead of, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| 23 for people without mental illness in the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| And when they get out, they may well have lost their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| They may well have custody issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| It's a vicious cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| It's a spiraling down that this is part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| 75% of people in the jails in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| are in there for nonviolent offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| such as traffic issues, property offenses, public order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| offenses, and drug offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| And oh, by the way, 72% of the mentally ill, I think I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| have a substance abuse disorder as well, as do most inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| The number of people in the prisons nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| at a given time is roughly twice that of the people in the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| But there are 19 times as many people who come into the jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| And so there's an awful lot of people impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| And this is something that needs to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| It's great to see the commitment of the prison system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| I'm great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| It's great to see the commitment by our two mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| But $200,000 a piece is a drop in the bucket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| compared to the $76 million jail budget and the $760 roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| million overall budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| We really need to put a lot of energy into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| One reason that this resolution is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| is so that we will empty beds, because we're under orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| to end the overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| So this is something that's penny wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| It's something that will show a result. We will save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| If we have better conditions in the jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| you won't have so many lawsuits that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| keep having to pay off to a much higher overall than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| And Crystal Gourley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| Crystal Gourley, 235 Carter Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Department P1, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2807)|
| 0:46:57| So the safety center is facing a few deficits, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| pertaining to the marginalized initiative that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| has been taken against those who are not nonviolent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| But nonetheless, they face the very same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| problematic mental abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Individuals who are mentally ill and violent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| are not exuding primal behaviors because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| won't control their behaviors on their own volition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| They can't, thus them being mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| leaving them socially and mentally destitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| having to face a terrible demon that they did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| ask for initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| The polarization of requirements for admittance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| into the safety center doesn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| embody all the common factors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| more times than not is indicative of mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| Therefore, this margin is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| acting as a disservice to those whom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| face specialized difficulties in battling their situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| This disservice is also called demonization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| by way of dehumanization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| So how is it that you are able to filter out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| which mental illnesses you find fitting worth saving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| What happens to those who are labeled as violent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Will they be placed in jail and essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| left to repeat the cycle of Lewis Flagg, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| was beaten because he was labeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| as mentally ill and violent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Which brings me to my next point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| What is being done on the end of the street level bureaucrats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| I understand that there will be a specialized force made up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| of X number of police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| However, if you take a good look at the mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| demographic, they are not contained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| in one particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| They are East, South, North, and West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| So what happens when an officer who is not on the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| encounters someone who is mentally ill and possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| violent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Will there be a police training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| put into place to teach these officers how to properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| service those who face mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| regardless of their violent or nonviolent behavior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Is there a request for funding to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| this crucial necessity for those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| face social and mental issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| It would be in best interest if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| began to think about the effects of a slippery slope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| could interfere with the Geneva Convention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| granted that the funding for police training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| is looked at as a minuscule necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| And the services which will be provided to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| by way of Helen Ross McNabb and other centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| in conjunction with mental health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| do they have the funds to cover this initially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Three days, 25 beds, that's not enough people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| You know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Which is why Knoxville went to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| to visit Billy Billionaire, who reneged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| on his initial agreement to help fund the state in which he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| was voted to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| The state has told us no for the simple fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| the governor doesn't care about doing anything more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| for social service programs and second chance programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| or anything that would benefit the poor, colored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| or gentrified communities than what he has to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2987)|
| 0:49:47| You know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Let's not play this game like it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| a friendly round of whatever Milton Bradley and Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Brothers has on the shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Let's be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Is there a fiscal benefit for the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| to have these people incarcerated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Is that the reason behind his lack of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| for the safety center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| But that would be distasteful, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Bottom line, the issue is not of any importance to our governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| He says we just don't have the money right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| However, he's the wealthiest politician in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| And it's evident that money constitutes for human lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| by his actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| How is it that several people, maybe including some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3020)|

| 0:50:29| but our own king of the state, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| needed us to get him into office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| refuses to fight for his own people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| What's even more of a shame is that several people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| helped Hazem get to where he is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| but your own king won't fight for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| And we all know what the good book says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| about the difficulty of a rich man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| entering the gates of heaven than it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| is for a camel to enter the eye of a needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| But I digress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| I said this to say that we need to open our eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| and we need to go back to the drawing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| to establish a way in which Knox County is not marginalizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| those who are mentally ill, pushing our governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| to step in and take some real action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| in representing Knox County the way he promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| I also advise that county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| would do a better job with informing the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| about the safety center meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| maybe with a little more media coverage about the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| The way of informing the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| should not just fall on the shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| of a handful of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| This will be a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| If we could build this together, then maybe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| could be on our way to a better relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| between the community of commoners and the powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| that have always been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3087)|

| 0:53:04| Not unless you have a question, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| I do just have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3187)|

| 0:53:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| I just have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| I was asked if you guys had calculated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| what the cost of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| It won't be a whole lot, because if the folks are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| then they're getting paid anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| If they're deployed, then it's going to soon run out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| and they'll be on leave without pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| and it'll actually be less money from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| So this is a savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| It's less than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3239)|

| 0:54:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| We have a couple announcements to pass along to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| First of all, and Dr. Buchanan, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| want to add anything to this, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| going to announce that tomorrow the US Surgeon General is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| going to be in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3311)|

| 0:55:19| How'd I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3319)|
| 0:55:19| Pretty good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| All right, so but tomorrow, if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| people that are listening to us on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| if they would like to come and listen to the US Surgeon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| General speak, it's been a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| since the Surgeon General has been in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| That's 7 o'clock tomorrow at the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3332)|

| 0:55:37| The doors open at 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3337)|

| 0:55:52| and you can sign up to get a ticket to come into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| Anything you can add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| But we're honored to have the Surgeon General in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| all day tomorrow for several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| 140 Dameron Avenue, still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| The Metro Drug Coalition is the primary organizer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| of this event, so we're allowing them to use our space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| to host the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| But it is an honor to have the Surgeon General here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| He is here in part to discuss with some community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| leaders the opiate addiction problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| that we have here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| And you may be aware, the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| is putting a whole lot of money toward increasing treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| access for everyone across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| and the state of Tennessee will be getting some of that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| So I think those things are connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| My understanding of the town hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| is going to be more general questions about him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| and about what he wants to do in his tenure as Surgeon General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3415)|

| 0:58:24| I'm trying to evade it as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| but I think it's coming up, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| OK, at our regular stated meeting next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| I'll call him first, Commissioner Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| but Mr. Law Director and myself, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| have an inkling that I am being arrested also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| We will be contacting you to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| us go our bail, Muscular Dystrophy Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3530)|
| 0:59:01| I have one more thing that's going to be last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| but let me get Brad Anders first, then you'll be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| You'll not be last, you'll be next to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3552)|
| 0:59:12| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Yeah, I'm going to pose a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| to the law director for research for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| In regard to beer, there's a store on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| that has a violation who gained that license as a qualifier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3562)|
| 0:59:31| had a state wine only license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| And they gave that wine only license up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| So can they still possess a county beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| after giving up the state wine license that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| guaranteed them override of county beer zoning laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Commissioner McKenzie, you are next to last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| because there is one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| All right, so this was actually kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| of connected with the previous speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| and our resolution on jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| So on Thursday from 6 to 8, at St. Luke's Episcopal Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| there's going to be a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| about the privatization of jails and also the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| So that's going to be this coming Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| at St. Luke's Episcopal Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| And you were not even next to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| You were third from last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| It's about beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3635)|
| 1:00:35| I'll get with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| The last thing is that my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| I request that you get yourself prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| because with our advancing age, it may be impossible for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| to, the joy may overwhelm us that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| going to have a baby shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| And sometime between now and the 1st of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| we will have a baby shower here at commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| Everyone needs to be planning on said baby shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3672)|
| 1:01:20| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| And it's a girl, so we all have to wear pink, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| It's going to be a girl, so we will all wear pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3686)|
| 1:01:33| Beer next week is an hour earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| I'm glad that that was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Beer next week will begin an hour early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| There may be some inkling of the next two months later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3706)|
| 1:01:54| August meeting may also have a large impact on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| with beer violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| So we may be meeting early for beer the month after next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3722)|
| 1:02:11| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| That's what Wolfie had said, that they had another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| You will know more about that as time progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| And your batch coming, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| There'll be nothing else to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Start your planning for the baby shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620?start=3744)|
