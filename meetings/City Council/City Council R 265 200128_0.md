| 0:02:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Are there items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Yes, I would like to move to withdraw resolution 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| That's in regard to a possible lease of certain property between the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| Is your microphone on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| That's a matter that has to do with a possible lease agreement between Thrive Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| Soar Youth Ministries and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| That's been postponed several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| I've talked to Mr. Brace about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| It seems like the prudent thing to do at this point is to withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| There are certain issues between the parties that haven't quite been worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| We still have some hopes that that will be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| But at this time, I would like to move to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=192)|

| 0:03:20| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=200)|

| 0:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=202)|

| 0:03:30| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| I'd like to move to withdraw item 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| Motion made to withdraw item 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=215)|

| 0:03:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| This item 12C is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Are there any other items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| How about items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| I would like to make a motion to postpone item 10A, which is the zoning matter under our hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=241)|
| 0:04:10| I'd like to make a motion to postpone that for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| And if council approves, I'd like to ask the parties involved to meet to hear each other out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| and to see if there's any common ground or agreement that can be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| And then I'd also like to acknowledge there are a lot of people here tonight who care about our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| who have come out to hear about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| So I'm sorry, but I'm asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=276)|

| 0:05:18| Any new items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=320)|

| 0:05:35| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=335)|

| 0:05:43| The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| Next is mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| First, I want to welcome Kristen Farley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| This is her first council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| As my communications director, everybody wave to Kristen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| Eric is showing her the ropes, and we're glad to have you on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| And if you have any questions to the media, have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| counsel people about communications, talk to Kristen and Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| Next, I want to get into the issue that you recently got an e-mail about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| body-worn cameras for our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| And as promised two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| I'm coming back to you with a recommendation on cameras, body-worn cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| And I'm proposing that all patrol officers be equipped with body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| We are already accepting proposals from vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| and KPD has adopted policies for use of the body cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| and officers have tested them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| The plan is to put this into the budget for this coming budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| and the cost would be $1.7 million the first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| and about $600,000 per year for the next four years after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| and there would have to be a new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| Do you have a lot of details that you sent by e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| including a very thorough memo that Chief Thomas and her team prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| that gives all the details about the funds and exactly how they'd be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Some of it is on equipment, and a lot of it's also on data management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| As you all know from studying this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| this is a tool that the public is very interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| and our officers are also very interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| It's another tool to add accountability and transparency to our law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| It's not going to solve all our problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| but I think it's an important step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| If you have any questions about the specifics of this, you can ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| If you have really detailed questions, please contact Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| because she'll be much better equipped to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| And, again, this will be part of the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| and if you all decide that it requires warrants and workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| we're happy to participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| Next, I wanted to say that tonight is the first night we have deaf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| and hard of hearing viewers watching on community television tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| now have the option of choosing closed captioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| This replaces sign language interpreters, but it's an upgrade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| because anyone can use closed captioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| even if you don't know American Sign Language, so it adds to accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| You have to turn on closed captioning using your TV remote control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| and on-screen guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| If you have any questions, call your cable TV provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| CTV, or Stephanie Brewer-Cook, our ADA coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| I also want to mention something that's near and dear to my heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| that's coming up soon, is the census, decennial census, Census 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| I brought you back a souvenir from Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| You all each have your own pin that can help advertise and promote Census 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| Yesterday we helped open up the regional East Tennessee office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| which is right here on Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| and they already have something like 75 people working every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| for the whole 20-county, 30-county region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| But I'm here to encourage all of us, and we're all public figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| and you all have your networks and spheres of influence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| to encourage everybody to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| We're working hard as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| I was actually part of the Complete Count Committee that started to work two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| when I still worked for the city before I became mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| And so a lot of people on the city staff have been working out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| doing outreach with faith-based organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| with people in our minority groups and community-serving organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| with UT and Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| It's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| As you all know or may know, I grew up as part of the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| My dad had the bulk of his career working for the census right out of college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| and ended up being director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| So I am passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| And it's not just the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| It also means a lot of financial resources for our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| because the count that we get in 2020 is those numbers that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| for the city of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| are used for the federal allocations for everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| the Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| things that come to hospitals and schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| and all kinds of grants that we can apply for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| for CAT and other transportation projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| Just really, really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| And the most likely group of people to be undercounted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| are low-income children under five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| So we need to count everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| but any effort we can do to promote it, the more the merrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| If you guys want to get involved in communicating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| the hashtag that we're using is CountMeInKnox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| So if you're into hashtags, that's one to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| And the estimated amount of money that each person is connected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| is anywhere between $1,000 and $1,900 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| So if we miss someone, and that's an oversight for 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| that's between $10,000 and $20,000 that we miss for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| for our schools, our hospitals, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| So let's promote Census 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| The buildup's happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| People will get stuff in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Census Day is April 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| We'll be planning some events as a city, outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| and I'll be sure to invite you guys to as many things as you want to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Last but not least, I want to mention a new KUB Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| Thanks to KUB, we'll cut a ribbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| and officially open another new Greenway called Kuwahi Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=709)|
| 0:11:59| It's on the north side of Neyland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| connecting to Joan Cronin Way with Neyland Greenway and Third Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| It's a third of a mile long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| It's constructed by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| Thank you, KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| And we'll be maintaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| The ribbon cutting is next Wednesday, February 5th, at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| Limited parking in a small lot next to Third Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| or you can walk, bike, or take transit there, or carpool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| So I hope some of you can make it next Wednesday, 4 p.m., February 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| And that is it for my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| And next, do any of you have reports from your committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| I just wanted to say that the East Tennessee Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| is seeking community input on Sutherland Avenue enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| as a part of their community collaborative project for 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| It's going to be Wednesday, February 12th, from 430 to 630,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| at the National Guard Main Headquarters located at 3300 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| It's really a great opportunity for everyone in the community to come by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| and look at and think about what they'd like to see along Sutherland Avenue in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| and I'm really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| Councilmember Singh, who's not able to be here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| wanted me to announce that January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| and we have some representatives from the Coalition Against Human Trafficking here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| If they would like to please come up and say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| My name is Natalie Ivey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| I'm the Executive Director of the Community Coalition Against Human Trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| We're a nonprofit organization that's based here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| and we serve all 33 counties of east Tennessee related to human trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| So we provide awareness, outreach, prevention, and direct services to survivors of trafficking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| and we wanted to take this opportunity to thank our city council here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| for their support and the work that they do to help us facilitate the work that we do in serving survivors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| So it's important to note that Knoxville is home to an emergency receiving center for victims of trafficking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| one of very few that are available in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| We provide that to all kinds of individuals here in east Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| And then we'll be moving to opening transitional housing here in Knoxville as well this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| So we have a lot of big things coming this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| and we expect those service numbers to continue to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Our service numbers have for the most part doubled, if not more, every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| for the folks that we're serving here in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| and that includes adults and kids here in east Tennessee who have experienced trafficking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| and need specialized services from our agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| So we just wanted to take this evening to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| and use the opportunity to raise awareness related to human trafficking here in east Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=899)|
| 0:15:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Thank you for the work that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| Any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=916)|

| 0:19:43| One of the things that was different about this year's package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| is this the first time you guys have broken it out like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| You said in the package it said that it was broken out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| to get better response to the RFPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| I just wondered why now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Why haven't we done that before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| What triggered that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| We broke it out into two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| There are a couple of asphalt contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| who have just built asphalt plants locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1213)|

| 0:20:20| but they aren't big enough to do the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| So the idea of breaking it out was to get more bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| and more competition on the bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1227)|

| 0:23:27| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| I just thought this agenda item leapt out at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| I thought it was a good opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| I don't know if Ms. Melnick wants to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| I think this is an opportunity as a PSA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| to make sure that people are aware of what to do with these materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| that we are voting on spending money to dispose of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| so if you want to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Patience Melnick, Waste and Resources Manager in Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Yeah, our hazardous waste facility is underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Only about 5% of city and county residents visit it every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| and it's a great place to take all those things that all of us have in our house right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| things in our basement like old stains, old electronics, batteries, oil, cooking oil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| all different manner of kind of normal household chemicals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| that really shouldn't go into our landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| The facility is a free, it's always free for city and county residents to drop off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| and this contract allows for the contractor who comes and picks it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| and disposes of it properly and, you know, does the right thing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| And if folks want specific lists of what can be taken there, it's on the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1476)|

| 0:24:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I just think it's important because I have a feeling some folks pour it out other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| and this is really why we have the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| It's very important that we do with it what we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Well, quickly, could you remind folks where to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| And the hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1501)|

| 0:25:03| What are the hours of the facility and where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1503)|

| 0:25:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1508)|

| 0:25:12| which houses the transfer station and the household hazardous waste facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1512)|

| 0:25:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1538)|

| 0:25:45| and kind of make it more convenient for people to access these materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1545)|

| 0:27:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| My name is Chris Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Good evening, Mayor Ken Cannon and Vice Mayor McKenzie and the Knoxville City Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| It's an honor to speak with you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| My name is Chris Jones, as I said, and I'm an elder at Basswood Church here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| And I wanted to speak with you this evening to let you know who we are and what we are committed to do as a church for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| Basswood is a Reformed Baptist church that believes that the Bible is the infallible, inerrant word of God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| and we believe that it is the absolute final standard for life and morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| As such, we take very seriously God's commands to us as followers of Christ concerning our role as citizens of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| and our duty to you all as legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| Let me list a few of those for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| First, God commands his people in the Bible to pray for those who have been placed over us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| The Apostle Paul says in 1 Timothy 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| for kings and all who are in high positions, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| To be completely transparent, I've not done a very good job of this myself in regard to this legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| and I am asking the Lord to forgive me, and I'm committed with our church to pray for each of you by name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| This last Sunday evening, each council member was prayed for by name by our church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| and we are committed to praying for you each in turn one a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| This week, our church members are going to be praying for Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| Second, followers of Christ are commanded to honor those who are charged with ruling over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| The Apostle Peter instructs Christians in his day to honor the emperor in 1 Peter 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| This legislative group is not the same as it was during the Roman times, but the principle is still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| We want to let you know how much we appreciate all the hours that you put into serving our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| Most, I'm sure, go unrecognized and unnoticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| We thank you for the meetings and the speeches and the attention you give to watching over Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| We thank you for allowing us this forum where we can address you with our concerns that we have for our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| most notably the scourge of abortion, and we want you to hear us say, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| And third, we are called as Christians to submit to those that govern over us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| Again, the Apostle Paul in Romans 13, let every person be subject to the governing authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| And that might sound like a strange thing, considering we, I'm sure, differ with you on a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| But this brings me to the close and a final question that I would like to leave you with this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| We as Christians have not decided to behave this way towards you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| We must. We are commanded by God in his word, which is the standard by which we must live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| Can I ask each of you this evening, what is your standard as a legislative body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Many might say that it is to do the will of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| But surely if the people of Knoxville all rose up and demanded a reinstitution of the slave trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| which was we've heard from several ladies earlier, is still very active in our world today through sex slavery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| You would not acquiesce that request. Is your standard to do the most good for this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| I ask you then, how do you define good? You must have a standard if you were to rule this people well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| And we are commending to you the sole infallible rule of faith and practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| And that is the inspired word of God. We would be glad to speak with you more about this as we have opportunity in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| Thank you all very much. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| The next person signed up is Bruce Spangler. Please come to the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| Hi, I'm Bruce Spangler, and I'm privileged to be the CEO of the Volunteer Ministry Center located at 511 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| American Canon and City Council members, thank you for this opportunity to speak with you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| I have to admit, whereas I am disappointed about the decision there on East 5th, I've got the city-owned properties, I do respect the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1886)|
| 0:31:36| As you are aware, VMC have intended to build permanent supportive housing on those lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| as well as purchase the housing facility located at 1501 East 5th Avenue, also known as Positively Living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1902)|
| 0:31:50| of which we are continuing our due diligence with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| In between those two is Myrtle Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| As part of our previous conversations, the potential conveyance of that closed street to VMC is still important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| Now that the vacant lots will remain as is, the acquisition of Myrtle Street continues to be part of our development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1928)|
| 0:32:17| That additional place is very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Therefore, I hope that the action or the lack of action today does not impede nor inhibit that conveyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1940)|
| 0:32:29| The last time I spoke to this body, November of last year, I mentioned that there were 53 individuals, known by name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| who needed permanent supportive housing that very evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| I regret to say that that number has grown, grown to 66, as of January 26, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| Again, the need for permanent supportive housing cannot be overstated, nor should it be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| It's been nearly a decade, as I have said before, since additional permanent supportive housing opportunities have been developed in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1975)|
| 0:33:04| So I simply want to remind us all that permanent supportive housing is not shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| The reference of homeless housing is both a misnomer and may even be a suggestion that the residents are more dangerous than any other renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1989)|
| 0:33:18| But now I'd like to simply conclude with this, that I am so appreciative of the City of Knoxville and this body for your investment in responding to the experience of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=1998)|
| 0:33:31| This city has made investments that are paying dividends for those who are receiving the services of outreach, emergency shelter, case management, and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2011)|
| 0:33:43| And that has been done by many providers of which you are making that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| As one of those providers in our community receiving that support, I do thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| In particular, I want to give you a very brief update on the two recent initiatives that you have made possible by your investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2035)|
| 0:34:03| Our two street outreach case managers had contact with 545 unduplicated individuals in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2043)|
| 0:34:12| Over 125 of those have been referred to housing case management, and 15 have achieved housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2052)|
| 0:34:21| Our latest effort of the four-year located on the campus of the Salvation Army, which opened on December 16th, has 36 participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2061)|
| 0:34:30| Some were linked to housing case management at entry, but many were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| And now we know that eight of those individuals who were not engaged with housing case management are now receiving that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| In addition, two individuals have been assisted into moving out of the four-year into transitional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| One individual has been selected off the CHAMP by name list for an application to permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| So, in conclusion, I am grateful that VMC can be one of your partners in ending and preventing homelessness in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2097)|
| 0:35:07| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Thank you, Mr. Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Do you care if I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Well, we are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Okay, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| I'll ask it by email later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Next person signed up for public forum is Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| Mr. Emmons, please come up to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2123)|
| 0:35:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| Hey, my name is Sam Emmons, and I live at 301 Woodlawn Pike here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2136)|
| 0:35:47| And first of all, thank you for your leadership in our city and for making the ongoing sacrifices that you make to attend to its welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2147)|
| 0:36:01| I have a lot of respect for the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| I'm here to speak, and hopefully this isn't taboo, regarding the upcoming choice council will face when selecting someone to serve out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2166)|
| 0:36:16| remainder of Councilwoman Welch's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| At vain, I'd just like to detail the traits of leadership that I'd hope to see in the person chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2180)|
| 0:36:31| I'm not personally applying for that position, but I am a resident of District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| So what I'll share are my opinions on this, and I'm not claiming to have it all figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| And probably I'm not telling you anything that you don't already know about leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| I believe, though, that effective and just leadership is characterized by peace, wisdom, and sound judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2213)|
| 0:37:03| And I really see these as interconnected pillars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| They're what I'm trying to personally practice and grow in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| Where these things come from is maybe for another discussion, but it seems to me that they should be characteristics of a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| If a person is not at peace, if a person is not at peace, it's hard for me to believe that they will bring peace to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2239)|
| 0:37:28| I do think conflict can be entered into from a peaceful posture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| And that would mean entering into conflict while still caring for the other party instead of despising them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2253)|
| 0:37:44| On the other hand, if a person is only peaceful, and this is why I think these three pillars are interconnected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| if a person is only peaceful and doesn't have wisdom or sound judgment, they won't be able to make good decisions and will end up avoiding conflict altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2270)|
| 0:38:00| So wisdom is another pillar of leadership, and that entails the ability to understand the full scope of a situation and its context in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2280)|
| 0:38:11| It's good to want more wisdom and not assume we already have it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| The third, maybe not final, pillar is sound judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| That is the ability to say what's good, what's neutral maybe, what's bad with accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2301)|
| 0:38:30| Calling something good is a judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Judgment without peace or wisdom is abrasive and abusive, and it's generally not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2314)|
| 0:38:48| Good leadership also takes humility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| Call me crazy, but I'm getting that idea from George Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| Good leadership is also proven and tested in bearing responsibility well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| It's tested and proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Secure leadership is sympathetic towards those who have experienced hardship without being ruled by people's demands or opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2343)|
| 0:39:15| I think selflessness is a good path towards doing something constructive in our city rather than self-absorption or self-centeredness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2355)|
| 0:39:25| We're all flawed, myself included, and a selfless leader, I believe, will help people flourish while recognizing that contending with our flawed nature will be part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2365)|
| 0:39:39| Another hope that I have about our next council member is that they'll lead people, as I've already seen being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2379)|
| 0:39:50| lead people into being part of the solution to the conflicts or crises they face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| And I think we as citizens ought to try harder to be a part of the solution to the challenges we do face, myself included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2396)|
| 0:40:08| So I just ask that you please pick someone who is as capable and careful and considerate as Councilwoman Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2408)|
| 0:40:17| and thank you for your time and, again, for the good work you do for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| Thank you, Mr. Emmons. That concludes public forum, and this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200128?start=2423)|
