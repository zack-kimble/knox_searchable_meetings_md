| 0:02:30| Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| The ayes have it and the minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| Mayor, I'd like to postpone Item 12F for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| Okay. 12F, that is the closing of a portion of Myrtle Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| Correct. And I'd like to ask Becky Wade from City Community Development to come up and please speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=177)|
| 0:03:04| Thank you. Did we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| A second, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| So, Director Wade, if you'd like to speak to this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| I'm Becky Wade, Director of the City Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| Development of affordable housing and coordination of homelessness services comes through my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=202)|
| 0:03:29| We're requesting that Council postpone a vote on Ordinance 12F, the closure of a section of Myrtle Street at East 5th Avenue for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=209)|
| 0:03:39| I want to provide a little background and context of what's being proposed at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| which is comprised of three city-owned vacant lots next door to Positively Living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| The city acquired this tract three years ago after the Smokies Southern League baseball team left Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| and Caswell Park was being developed as a recreation space and public park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| Houses located on the property on East 5th Avenue were demolished to make room for the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| and ultimately this specific tract became cut off from the park by an outfield fence of the softball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| It is idle and not used by Parks and Recreation, but it is zoned as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| Recently, Volunteer Ministry Center approached the city with an idea to acquire the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| and develop 48 permanent supportive housing units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| There's a great need in Knoxville for these units, which serve extremely low-income residents, the poorest of our poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=276)|
| 0:04:45| It's very early in the planning process, and these units are extremely expensive to build and manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| but VMC is working on its plans and exploring the availability of grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| Because of the proximity to transit and support services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| we believe this is a good location for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| At the city's request, once VMC had some conceptual plans for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| they reached out to the Park Ridge Neighborhood Association to provide information and seek input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| We asked that this be done to ensure that the neighborhood would be informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| and included in the process at its early stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| The city will continue to work with VMC and Park Ridge and other nearby neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| on both the zoning and the proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| We believe a postponement of the street closure will give the city, VMC, and the neighborhood more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| to look at the options and come back with more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| There will be more opportunities for public input if this project becomes viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| In addition to the proposed street closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| city council at a future meeting would vote on the land conveyance and a rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| With the city as the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| community development had asked that this property be returned to residential use during recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| and the draft recode map proposed an RN-3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| It is important to note that the proposal by VMC will require an RN-6 or planned development zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=378)|
| 0:06:28| before it could move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| So this proposed zoning would have proceeded through Knoxville-Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| and then city council before the project could move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| Nevertheless, due to misunderstandings we inadvertently caused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| this morning we asked Knoxville-Knox County Planning to keep the open space zone on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| The recode website zoning map will be updated by tomorrow morning to reflect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| So when city council votes on the recode ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| there will be no change in the land use for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| It will remain designated as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| We believe that leaving the existing open space in place for now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| and starting from scratch on a rezoning at Myrtle and East 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| is clearly a better, more transparent approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| The bottom line, we request a postponement on the vote to close a section of Myrtle Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| volunteer ministry center, and the city will continue developing plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| for permanent supportive housing units at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| And if the project is deemed to be feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| the rezoning process would start with Knoxville-Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| and then city council would vote on the rezoning and conveyance of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| But I emphasize that it's early in the development process with many steps ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| and many opportunities for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| Thank you. Thank you, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| Okay, so are there any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| So the vote is on the postponement for 12 weeks of 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Are there any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| The consent items are 11U, Certificate of Compliance, and 12S202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| For the mayor's report, I want to start off by talking about the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| A week ago, a large fire at a recycling business in Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| in North Knoxville spewed thick smoke and forced the evacuation of about 100 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| And I want to express, first of all, my admiration and appreciation for our firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| who successfully fought that fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| I've heard the same sentiment from people all over the city over the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| Our fire department had a lot of support from other city departments and many community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| So I want to ask our fire chief, Stan Sharp, to give us an update on the fire and how we handled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| Thank you, Mayor Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| And thank you for those kind words about our firefighters and the work that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| I also would like to express my personal appreciation for the tremendous work of our firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| throughout the operation, particularly during the initial response to the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| and throughout the first day and night when conditions were at their worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Our men and women did an outstanding job of protecting the public and nearby buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| containing the fire, and ultimately extinguishing the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| Special thanks also are due to all of our fire department support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| It wasn't just our firefighters on duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| We had virtually all of our support staff on the scene at one time or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| That included both of my deputy chiefs, support staff from administration, EMS, training, fire investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=595)|
| 0:10:05| fire inspections, our chaplain, our radio communications, and our logistics division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| We also had several other city departments and outside agencies and individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| both from the neighborhood and throughout the city, that provided valuable assistance during the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| I'm sure I'll leave some out, but the list is so impressive that I want to mention as many as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| So I want people to know and appreciate the great cooperation that occurs in this city during an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| The city departments that supported the operation included the Knoxville Police Department, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| traffic engineering, public service, stormwater engineering, communications, and fleet services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=641)|
| 0:10:49| and that's specifically our fire department shop mechanics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| They are awesome mechanics and a great staff to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=652)|

| 0:11:16| I just can't say enough about the support we've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Whenever we have an operation like this, we can handle the firefighting, but we need support from other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| As far as the firefighting operations themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| our initial response included six firefighting apparatus and two district chiefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=689)|
| 0:11:37| Pretty early on in the event, additional engines were requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| and by the end of the day, we had approximately 18 firefighting apparatus and 16 firefighters on hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| to contain and extinguish the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Our primary objectives, first of all, were to protect the public and our firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| and then to contain and extinguish the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| As a precautionary measure, we ended up evacuating the first row of homes closest to the fire early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=719)|
| 0:12:07| We expanded evacuations later in the evening to protect the public from smoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| that we knew would begin settling as the air cooled during the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| We conducted air monitoring throughout the operations, and we continue that to today on a periodic basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| We use local media, social media, and the Knox County Emergency Alert System to keep residents informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| We fought the fire obviously on Wednesday, on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| and by Friday and Saturday, we were just hitting hot spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| On Saturday, we turned the property back over to the owner with a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| that he maintain a 24-hour fire watch, that he secure the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| and that he keep our fire marshal informed of what is going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| We are still conducting periodic air monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| We did yesterday afternoon and again this afternoon throughout the neighborhood near the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| and we're coming back with zero readings on all of our monitoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| and we'll continue to do that on a periodic basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=791)|

| 0:13:18| and there was always food that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| People brought in food and refreshments and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| and I know Yasin's Falafel House, they brought some food, and I'm sure others did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| So really a great community outpouring of support for our firefighters and our emergency responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| A lot of great teamwork there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| Of course, many people in the community stepped up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| People were looking after one another and taking care of their neighbor's pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| and a lot of great things were happening in that community to show support for one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=825)|
| 0:13:53| I know y'all spoke at the neighborhood meeting on Monday night, last night, and that was well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| I heard back that people were happy that you all were there to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| So I'd really right now just ask that we all give a good round of applause for our firefighters and great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=846)|
| 0:14:29| Chief Sharp, please let your folks know how much we all appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=875)|

| 0:15:46| He doesn't like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Any of your team that's here, if you have any others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| For 30 years in a row, the finance department has been recognized by a leading professional association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| for its commitment to meeting the highest principles of governmental budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada, or the GFOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| recently awarded us a Distinguished Budget Presentation Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| Good municipal budgeting, wise use of tax dollars, and transparency have long been the mainstays of Knoxville city budgeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| and we enjoy the highest bond ratings in the city's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| The GFOA award is presented to finance director Jim York, but Jim always gives great credit to his staff's professionalism and expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=986)|
| 0:16:36| Not coincidentally, Jim has been with the city more than 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| He started about the time the city's streak of awards began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| Jim is here tonight, and I want him to talk to us a second about this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1004)|
| 0:16:53| First of all, you know, it is not my award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| It's awarded to the finance department and to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| We have a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| This is something that we strive for, and I'm pleased to be here on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| This is an award that GFOA provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| There are actually several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| We also have received one for our audit for 31 years in a row, and we're hoping to make that 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1040)|
| 0:17:31| These are things that, again, our peers in the finance sector, government finance, recognize us for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1051)|
| 0:17:41| and, again, for that I'm probably more proud because it is something of recognition by our peers in terms of the quality of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1061)|
| 0:17:52| But, again, just to note, we could not do it without the work of our staff, council, and mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| You know, when you give it for 30 years in a row, it could become sort of expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| and really we need to recognize how important it is each year that we achieve this goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1090)|

| 0:22:08| Councilman Saunders, we were going to have the vote on May 14th for recode, but now we're going to do it on May 30th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| No, we're doing two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1335)|

| 0:22:21| And the vote will be on which day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| On both days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| So it takes two readings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Just like a regular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| So two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| I just wanted to bring up that I've gotten a lot of e-mails and had a lot of conversations about people asking us to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| So maybe that's something that we need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| We've all gotten those, so I suspect we'll talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1361)|

| 0:23:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Council, let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Motion to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| So I'd like to ask, Arthur, please, you and your family, please come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| We also are happy tonight to have, yes, and bring your big old trophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| We also have our Tourism Commissioner, Mark Ezell, who is here, along with our Visit Knoxville CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1417)|
| 0:23:45| If you all would come up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you for being here, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| So what I want to do first is I'm not going to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| There's a long agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| I won't read the whole resolution, but a copy of this will go to the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| But basically, tonight we're celebrating, recognizing Ott DeFoe for winning the Super Bowl of Fishing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| which is the 49th Bassmaster Classic Championship, which we were excited to have right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| And you'll hear from Kim and the Commissioner in a minute about the economic impact of having the Bassmaster Classic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| But Ott actually is from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| He lives in Blaine now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| He was born in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| And so he is a local boy who was with us when we actually announced that Bassmaster was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1472)|
| 0:24:41| That's when we first met, you and some of the other local anglers who were there to talk about how important this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| And then he really made us proud by winning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| I want to tell you a little bit about Ott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| He was born in 1985 to Bud and Erica DeFoe in Knoxville, began fishing competitively at age 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1496)|
| 0:25:05| and joined the East Tennessee Bass Anglers Club at age 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| So you've been doing it a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| He is here with his family, and I'll let you introduce them in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| He has built a really prestigious career that included seven tour-level victories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| including being named the Bassmaster Rookie of the Year in 2011, 2012 the Bass Angler of the Year runner-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1523)|
| 0:25:33| and Major League Fishing Select Champion in 2014 and 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| All these have really long titles, Ott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| But he's really built a great career doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| and we are honored by this resolution to recognize you and to congratulate you and your family on this victory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| and to thank you for bringing the victory home to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Would you like to say a few words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Yes, thank you very much, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| I'm going to let Abby introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| She has to introduce the family, and then I'll say a few words about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Hi, I'm Abby, and my dad, Ott, and then my mom, Jenny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| and then my little sister, Lizzie, and my little brother, Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| And Abby spoke out at the Bassmaster Classic as well, how proud she was of her daddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| I know she's very good at speaking in front of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| and Lizzie made everybody cry there in case you were watching that at the final day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| But, yes, having lived here, having grown up here, lived here my whole life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| you know, fishing on these waters from the time I was my kid's size, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| so being out here fishing these waters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| and never dreamed that every single day that I had fished down there was actually practice for this very event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| You know, such a dream come true to have the Super Bowl of bass fishing come right here to home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| and then have to qualify for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| You know, when we did announce it down here, you know, a year ago, it was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| I had my work cut out for me, then I had to make sure to qualify for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| because just living and fishing doesn't mean you get to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| But I had a very blessed year and was able to make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| and then certainly the excitement of being able to fish a tournament like this in my hometown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| and then to be able to put the pieces of the puzzle together and go out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| and I give God all the glory for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I'm just very thankful that he used me and this platform to give him the glory for that event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| and just very thankful and very humbled by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| But the thing, being an angler, and I'm sure Kim and some of the others will mention, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| more about the economic impact, but just knowing how big this event would be for our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| and extremely thankful for the state of Tennessee, for Knox County, for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| and everything that you all did to get this event here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Being an angler, having grown up here, having fished this water my whole life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| I knew how great of an area that this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| I knew how the people would turn out for the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| but I feel like it probably was a bit of a risk for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| because even though I've seen it, I've lived it, you all hadn't been down that road yet before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| but very, very thankful that you all got behind bass fishing the way that you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| and were able to put this event here to have it in my hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| And then I'm not sure what your commission is on my part of the winnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| but just definitely thankful that you all did have that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| Well, Kim hasn't told us anything like that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Nothing, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| But no, just very, very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| And, you know, I grew up fishing in Florida with my dad, you know, in the river, in the ocean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| and I never expected the drama associated with the weigh-ins every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| I was there Friday and Sunday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| I know some of the council members and county commissioners were there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| I didn't know it could be so dramatic to weigh a fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| But it was quite the show that they put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| It was very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Yes, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| So that one, let's hear from Kim Bumpus and our commissioner, Isel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| to talk about the Spassmaster Classic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Thanks for having us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| I almost gave my points to Abby, because she's so well-spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| She could probably do it better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| But, no, this event is just really exciting for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| and we couldn't have scripted it better without winning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| And his family is pretty awesome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| and has become a part of the Visit Knoxville family now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| But it was a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| I'm not going to rob the commissioner's speaking points with giving you the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| because I know he has them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| But we are proud to claim the largest Bassmaster ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| And this event is truly an example of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Because, I mean, it wasn't just Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| It was everyone, you know, TWRA, PBA, the city, the county, the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| the university, every single person played a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| And without that, we couldn't have done this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| So, for that, I say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| And then this is the Commissioner on Tourist Development, Mark Isel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Thanks, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1797)|

| 0:30:23| that is meeting across the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1823)|

| 0:30:48| Tourism really does deliver the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| And Knoxville is setting a standard by showing the economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1851)|

| 0:31:56| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Scenic Knoxville of the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| decision to approve variances to increase the maximum square footage of a wall sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| from 24 square feet to 62.6 square feet and to increase the maximum overall height of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| a monument sign from 6 feet to 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Property located at 5418 Pratt Road, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| Okay, so we have, on behalf of the appellant, we have Joyce Feld, who's here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| And on the respondent, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| On behalf of the respondent, Ben Mullins, France McCollum Seymour, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Okay, we start first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Ed Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| We start with, right, the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| The appellant will start first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Joyce Feld, you would like to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| And please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| And as you know, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| And there's a timer right above my head here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| I think I missed giving one of the members of City Council the photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| So does anybody need them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Okay, I miscounted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| So my name is Joyce Feld, and I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| And I'm here tonight as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| And we are obviously appealing this decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| Unfortunately, the date of that particular BZA meeting was changed from its usual meeting time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| and so Scenic Knoxville was not actually there to oppose the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| We actually showed up two days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| But anyway, which wasn't helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| When purchased, this property had a single-family home on it, and it was Zoned R1, which is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| In 2016, the owner applied for commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| Planning staff at that time recommended denial of the rezoning in order to minimize the negative impact on the adjacent residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2034)|
| 0:34:03| The Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association also submitted a letter requesting that the rezoning be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| Instead, the planning commissioners voted to rezone the property to O1 office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| to provide a buffer between two properties on the street to the east and the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| which had previously been rezoned commercial, and the majority of the street, which remains today, R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| And then city council voted to affirm this recommendation from the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| Pratt Road is still a narrow, 16-foot-wide, primarily residential street with well-maintained workforce single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2073)|
| 0:34:42| The applicant's property directly abuts four single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| and several more are directly across the street, as well as many more that are down the street until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| You can see from the photographs that I provided that there is no slope or topographical issue with this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| and the lot adjacent to it where the trees are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| The land, in fact, is quite level here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| And the applicant is not being denied reasonable use of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| The trees at the border of the adjacent property are not unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| and they fit in with the character of the rest of the street where, if you look at the photographs, you can see many more trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| You can also see, especially if you look at the third photograph that I provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| you can also see that the lower branches of the tree bordering the street have already been cleared and do not obstruct the sight line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2135)|
| 0:35:44| There is enough property to meet the setback requirements for the ground sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| and not have the ground sign located behind that tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| A 6-foot-tall sign, which is what's allowed by O-1 zoning, will be just as visible as a 10-foot-tall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2153)|
| 0:36:01| And a 62.6-square-foot wall sign will not be obscured by the trees any less than a 24-square-foot sign as allowed in the office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2161)|
| 0:36:15| The applicant has stated that the requested signage is the standard signage used by Hilton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| but signage can be designed and constructed in an infinite variety of sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| The City of Knoxville sets the standards for the size and design of signs, not Hilton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| and those have been clearly stated in the sign ordinance, which was passed in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| Appropriate sign standards for O-1 zones were discussed at length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| and those that were adopted were considered optimal for that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| The applicant has stated also that guests won't have enough time to see the ground sign and make the turn into the driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| but this is a narrow 16-foot-wide residential street, and traffic probably moves at about 20 to 25 miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| and there's plenty of time to see the sign and make the turn into the driveway, which is at least 50 feet down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| KGIS is actually telling me that it's more than that, but it doesn't look like it's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| KGIS is telling me it's almost 200 feet, but when I eyeball it, it doesn't look like 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| But it's certainly far enough away that there's plenty of time to see the sign and make the turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| This residential property was zoned office to provide a buffer between the two commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| and the single-family homes, which are very close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| The value and the livability of these homes should be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| The applicant is not denied reasonable use of his property, as is required by the zoning ordinance, for the granting of a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2264)|
| 0:37:52| There is no demonstrated hardship here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| As Council knows, whenever a variance to the sign ordinance is granted, it sets a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| Ms. Feld, you need to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| It's not unreasonable for the applicant to adhere to the standards that have been set forth in the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| and therefore, Scenic Knoxville respectfully requests that this appeal be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Mr. Mullins, please, again, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| And if you would keep an eye on the timer, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Benjamin Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Did the Council members receive my letter and the photographs that I emailed this afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| Did everybody get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Because one of the things that I wanted to mention on the front end, if you look on photograph one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| Ms. Feld said that if you raised the sign by four feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| it would address the issues with the trees that are planted on that slope between the property lines and the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| And that isn't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| These trees are a mix between deciduous trees and conifer trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| and raising the sign on the wall would not address the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| And the photograph two shows the street, Pratt Road running down towards Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| and you can see there's a gradual slope, and all along the left side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| it would be the right side as you're approaching the hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| there are a line of trees that make this signage essentially invisible for the entire 900 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| from the intersection between Cedar Lane and to where the hotel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| Photograph three is the only opportunity, and that is right at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| If you look right there, you can see where the sign would be located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| which is why the sign increase is so essential to the visibility of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| But the remaining photographs demonstrate that until you get to the property line where the trees are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| none of the signs, the wall sign or the monument sign, are visible until you're about 50 feet away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2395)|
| 0:40:06| and going 25 miles an hour, which is the speed limit, that's still 37 feet per second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| So you have a little over a second before you can appreciate where you're supposed to turn on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| Now, these signs are not facing the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| None of the residents appeared to object to the variance that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| And, of course, we did only rezone a very narrow portion of this property to provide that buffer to 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| The property to the south is zoned commercial, where it would allow the same type of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| So all of those show that we are in conformity with the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| and that this is consistent with not only the brand that Hilton provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| but also I think the spirit of the ordinance, even though we're asking for a variance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| The topography of the sloping nature of the road as you approach restricts the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| The slope between the property line down to the Ingalls loading area and those mature trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2463)|
| 0:41:12| which are on that slope, which increases the height, restricts the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| So topography and the narrowness of this lot are certainly issues that are to be considered here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| Our only other alternative to increase the visibility of our signs as one is approaching would be to trim the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2483)|
| 0:41:33| And those are beautiful trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| We don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Mr. Smith, the owner who's here, doesn't want to do that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| We'd like to keep the trees and keep them as is with minimal effect as to their current, the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| They have been trimmed back a little bit for right-of-way purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| When you're turning left out of there, you have to have a clear right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| That's why it was trimmed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| But we believe that the Board of Zoning Appeals, who approved this by a vote of four to one, got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| And we would urge you to deny the appeal and uphold the variance that was provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| And, Mr. Smith, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Mr. Smith is the owner here, and he may be able to address something that I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| So each side can have up to three for up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| So we'll set the timer again for Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Edward F. Smith, Jr., 455 Laurel Ridge Lane, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| The real issue for this is not on Pratt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| The real issue is down at the corner on Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| There's a very small window when people are driving down Cedar Lane to be able to see the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| because of the way it's obscured by the trees on the Pratt Road and perpendicular to Pratt Road at Ingalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2567)|
| 0:42:55| It's a very short window, as I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| And the signage, the way it is now, or the way it would have to be to be in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| you wouldn't see the button sign on the building, and the monument sign would be very difficult to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| What we're trying to do is provide an opportunity for guests, tourists coming to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| to be able to see the hotel before they miss the street and get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| Coming up Pratt Road, it's not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| The size there is not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| The issue is down the street for people trying to find the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| I'd like to make a couple other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| This was a consolidation of four lots that we got together to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| and to provide a buffer with the back lots that's not things on to protect the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| The sign, which was submitted with the paperwork that you have, is really two signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2625)|
| 0:43:53| There's a circle and there's a little square underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| The area of square footage of the circle is 38.2 approximate square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| The little rectangle is about five square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| The way the ordinance calls for defining the size of the sign is you draw a rectangle around all parts of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| That's how it comes up with the 68 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| We're asking for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| It's not as big on the button sign as it appears to be because of the way the sign is defined by the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2658)|
| 0:44:27| and in the practicality of the actual sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| The monument sign has been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| If it's smaller, it's harder to see from Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| We're really trying to give our customers the best opportunity to see the new hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| It's better in the wintertime, but this time of the year, it's very, very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| So we're trying to optimize the customer's ability to see the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Thank you both very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| And now by the rules, Ms. Feld, you have up to two minutes for a rebuttal, should you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| No? Okay, you declined that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| So now, council, it's your opportunity to ask questions or make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| I'd like to ask Peter Ahrens to come forward and talk about it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2714)|
| 0:45:25| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| Peter, we've had the sign ordinance in place for almost four years, I guess, by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| You've seen other instances come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I only recall once it's come before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| I can't remember when it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Has there been one or two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| I don't remember how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| There's not been very many, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| This is at least the second that has been approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| The other was in the small neighborhood commercial section in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| Why do you think this met their conditions for an appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| They referenced topography and the line of sight from the adjacent trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| as the applicant had identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| Do you see this as a hardship on this property, that it's unique to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| and not unique to something else that's all across our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| It's really the legal issue that you're here to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| Voters elected you to decide that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Do you see this often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Do people ask about and ask for a variance or exceptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| It is not uncommon for people to request variances for sign height and area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| To your knowledge, this is at least about the only second one that's come in four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| This is the second one that I know of that has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| It's been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| That's all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| First question, since Mr. Ahrens is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Why was the BZA meeting moved to a different date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| The notice was not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| There was an issue with noticing it, and so we had to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| We reached out to all the Board of Zoning Appeals members to see if they could accommodate a shorter duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| Instead of making everybody at that month postpone for an entire month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| we thought it would be in our customers' best interest to see if we could move up the date as quickly as we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2855)|
| 0:47:44| on no fault of our own, on no fault of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| So it was mispublished in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| And so then the hearings were held at a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| And I'm just going to guess, based on my memory, BZA meetings occur on Thursdays, like Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| Thursday at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| See, I know that without actually looking it up, because that's what community members and neighborhood groups count on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| The neighborhoods and the community and the voters know that we meet every other Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| And to move that meeting really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| So the fact that there was no community group that showed up with opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| how did the word get out to them to know that the meeting was at a different time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| So that gives me a lot of great pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| The other thing is I would like to ask Mr. Frost, our attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| to refresh our memory here of what a hardship is by our charter, by our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| This comes under Appendix B, Zoning Regulations, Article Roman Numeral 7, Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| And I won't go into every word because it's a full page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| but the purpose of the variance is to modify the strict application of the specific requirements of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| in the case of exceptionally irregular narrow, shallow, or steep lots or other exceptional physical conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| The variance shall be used only where necessary to overcome some obstacle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| which is preventing an owner from using his property as the zoning ordinance intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| And you go down a little bit further and then you have the standards for granting variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| And I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| I'll pare it down some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Variances shall be granted only where special circumstances or conditions such as exceptional narrowness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2991)|
| 0:49:59| topography, or siding fully described in the findings of the board do not generally apply in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| They shall not be granted to allow use otherwise excluded from this particular district in which requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| and any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3021)|
| 0:50:29| It goes on further, but that is some of the core components of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| We've discussed it over the years, so like I said, I won't read it verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| So the other thing is, and I don't know if Ms. Brooks could comment on it or Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| but it keeps being the siding of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| And when I look at the aerial in KGIS and when I drove out there myself just before our meeting here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| what I see are trees that I would bet are required screening trees for that shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| They're very specifically around the perimeter of that parcel for the Ingalls, or whatever it's called, grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3064)|
| 0:51:13| So the conversation about cutting down the trees, I think they're required screening, possibly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| It's a C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| We wouldn't know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| I don't have those specific details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| I could look those up, but I don't have them off the top of my head right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| Is C6 required screening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Typically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| So if the trees were cut down, then the conversation would be they're required, likely, because that's what C6 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3095)|
| 0:51:45| Very likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| To me, what I see when I go out there and drive and looking at the aerial and looking at the properties is this is a property that's zoned 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3109)|
| 0:51:58| and it goes across to the other Hilton property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| There's also a buffer line of 01 there between that and this neighborhood that is a very nice, middle-to-low-income neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| that's very quiet, single-family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| It's clearly a very specific, intentional buffer zone with a buffer of trees surrounding that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| And what we're being asked here with the variance was permitting is for them to use an 01 buffer property as a C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3138)|
| 0:52:27| I mean, they're asking for the sign use that's allowed within a C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| So the 01 is intentional as the buffer for the neighborhood, but then should we treat it as a C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| And to me, there's not topography there, so I just don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Not to repeat much of what Mr. Frost said, I would like to read the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| I reviewed the BZA decision, the appeal, and the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| I've also reviewed Article 7, Section 2 on variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| In this case, the applicant's first listed reason is that Hilton requires this signage for the brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| The applicant also states their requested signage would be in line with competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| I don't think the trees on the property line are an impediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| They bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| The tree's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| The owners are not being deprived of any reasonable use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Without a variance, they're still able to construct a motel and have signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Though it may not be the signage they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| I do not believe there are special circumstances or conditions which apply to the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| I do not think any unnecessary hardship exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| Considering the record, the appeal, and the standards for granting a variance, I do not believe they have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| There are no special circumstances or conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| and the owners have not been deprived of any reasonable use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| as they may build their motel and use signage that complies with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| Therefore, I move to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| We have a motion and a second to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| Councilwoman, sing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| I'd like to ask a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| Whichever one of you two would like to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Mr. Mullins, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| And then Ms. Jewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Which neighbors are involved in this decision-making or have opinions in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| We have not heard any neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| I don't know if there are any neighbors here that have objected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| But we haven't heard of any of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| The signage is actually facing away from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| It's facing towards the commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| The monument sign, it will be there on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| It will be there whether it's six feet or whether it's the ten feet that's requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Ms. Jewell, do you know about any neighbors that are involved in this at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| I just know that the neighborhood association objected to the original rezoning in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3273)|
| 0:54:49| As did the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| I haven't made any contact with any neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| It's a very quiet, it's a sweet little residential street with workforce, what I call workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| And I wouldn't want to live across the street from bigger signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| The other question is, there is a Best Western on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| Are you on the same side of the street as that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| The Best Western and the Hampton Inn and Suites are both on the left side of the street as you're approaching the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| This is on the right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| So both sides of the street have some commercial or office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| The Ingalls takes up the entire space from Cedar Lane to the property line where they have the slope and the trees, which we were complaining about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| But you would be in competition with the Best Western?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| I forgot the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Oh, the Hampton Inn and Suites across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| And so is that one of the reasons that you want signage large enough to compete with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| The reason I pointed that out was just to show that we're in conformity with the overall neighborhood that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| And that's the reason the signage is facing away from the neighbors, but just to show that we're not out of character with the other signage that is in the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3361)|
| 0:56:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| I know Cedar Lane very well, and I know that people go very fast, and it's hard to see from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| This is also – this isn't further east on Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| This is up where all of the other commercial and the restaurants begin and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| Yes, it's right there off the interchange where you turn right on Cedar Lane off of the interstate and heading east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3390)|
| 0:56:38| And then Cedar Lane is right there across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| There's the Marathon gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| That's where the intersection at Pratt is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| And that's the only place that is visible for the signage from Cedar Lane is at the Marathon until you're right there on top of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| So you – this space was supposed to be the buffer between all the commercial and then the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| No, it was O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| It was rezoned O1, which would allow an office, and then the remaining property remained R1 to maintain that buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3421)|
| 0:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| I think initially they did ask for a C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| Of course, as you all know, if you rezone something to commercial, you know, you're not just looking at the intended use of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| but all the uses that could go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| So then we revised to go to O1, which would still allow us to do our intended use but would be a lot more limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| So that's the reason there is a buffer zone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| But if it wasn't for that and for the topography and the trees, we would be fine with the existing signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| One thing I'm concerned about is I think that Councilwoman Ryder is correct that it's the barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| Those trees are the barrier, so it's not that they can be cut down, which I wouldn't like anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| They may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| We don't want to cut them down either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| But they present the problem, not only the trees themselves, but because if you look at the KGIS map, which was attached to the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3472)|
| 0:58:02| you know, there is, you can see the topo, and you can see there is a pretty significant slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| at least a five-foot rise over a few feet from where the trees are planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| So they're actually planted on the slope themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| I just would like to make the comment that Mr. Mullins, I don't want to mischaracterize what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| but in reply to Councilwoman Singh-Perez, you said your property is like the other properties there along Pratt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3505)|
| 0:58:36| She was asking you about the Best Western, and your statement was that, yes, you are like those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| Well, it's the same use, but the zoning only would allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| But you're not alike because they're all zoned C6, and you're the buffer property of O1 from 2016 from the MPC decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3526)|
| 0:58:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| We are zoned O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Voiced opposition to C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| Councilman Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Mr. Mullins, the signage you're requesting, is it different than the signage in the other commercial areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| I mean, can you address that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| You know, I don't know if it is the same size or larger or smaller than the commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3554)|
| 0:59:22| I have not measured their signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| I know that we looked at what we needed for this particular piece of property, and it is a minimum that Hilton requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3564)|
| 0:59:33| but Ms. Feld is right that Hilton doesn't set the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| The zoning ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| I agree with that, just like, you know, whether one wants to live next to a sign doesn't set the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| It's what the ordinance would allow and the standards for the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| It is consistent with the other signage in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| Whether it's smaller or larger, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| I only mention that just to show that with the property that is surrounding it, it is compatible and consistent with the other signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3596)|
| 1:00:10| Okay, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| So before us we have a motion to approve the appeal by Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| So the motion to approve the appeal passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3627)|

| 1:00:29| McKenzie's absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| She stepped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Oh, she had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| She will be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Yeah, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Seven to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Seven to one with one absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3638)|

| 1:01:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Oh, Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| I was just wondering if Ms. Wade or Mr. Bentley would mind coming up and just giving us a little update on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3706)|
| 1:01:55| Good evening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| I can let you know that this is the last piece of the capital funding that the city has provided over the last 10 years for the revitalization of Walter P. Taylor Homes at Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3720)|
| 1:02:14| So this kind of concludes our funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| It's over $13 million over that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| And I'm going to let Ben Bentley come and give you an update on progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3740)|
| 1:02:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Ben Bentley, 901 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| So we are beginning, and actually May the 22nd we'll have our groundbreaking for phase four, which is the final residential phase at Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3752)|
| 1:02:42| Without the city's support, none of what we've done so far would have been possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| We have financing mechanisms to be able to build the units that are out there, and I think the units we build are really nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| But without the additional infrastructure funds to be able to come in and make road connections that didn't exist before, to add sidewalks, to put in new lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3771)|
| 1:03:01| the community wouldn't be what it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| So I want to say thank you to the city for your support, starting way back and then increasing that support over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| We've done a lot of things through this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| We've created energy efficient units, which we think is a big deal for our residents, and then obviously from a global perspective as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| These units meet enterprise green community standards, which is sort of the energy efficiency standard for affordable housing, a little bit like LEED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3800)|
| 1:03:28| except we don't have to pay as much for the certification, so that's kind of cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| Sorry if there's any big LEED fans out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| So there's that aspect of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| We've looked at this redevelopment from a safety standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| So everything we've done has been what architects call defensible design, taking sight lines, lighting, cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| all into consideration as you build a project to make sure that you're creating a safer neighborhood in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| I referenced connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| That was a big part of this plan, so including spaces where trails and greenways can go through the site, adding sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| reconnecting the street grid so that the folks that live in this community know that they're part of that broader East Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| We think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| That adds to the dignity that the people that live there feel about the place that they call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| So with that, I'll shut up and take any questions anyone might want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| What's the timeline for finishing the entire project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| It's something to certainly be proud of, and it's been since we've been on council the whole eight years, I think, we've been involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3866)|
| 1:04:34| It looks really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Yes, so we should have a ribbon-cutting for the final phase of Five Points in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| I would say, well, we may back it up to not the hottest month, so let's say September of 2020 would be a good date to aim for there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| I presume you'll invite those of us who will no longer be sitting around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| Most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Invite us as well as the new folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Everyone currently and in the future that's on this stage will receive an invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Commissioner Welch, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| I just want to thank you so much, Mr. Bentley and Ms. Wade and Linda Rust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| We're at the council dinner just before this meeting, and I just wanted to note that as part of that presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| one of the things that we learned is that about $13 million of city funds have been spent on this redevelopment project with almost $62 million leveraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3917)|
| 1:05:31| That's really very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| And then I just wanted to note something else because I think this is something that the city should be really proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| that we're so focused on making sure that this housing is being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| Since 2011, the city has invested about $44, almost $45 million with additional leveraged funds of $186 million in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3945)|
| 1:06:04| And it really has resulted in a huge number of affordable units available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| $4,300 or $4,000, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Our community development department does an amazing job with all of our community partners like KCDC, the private developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| the nonprofit housing developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Thank you, Becky, and all your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Okay, any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| This is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a license agreement with the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| allowing the city to use space on the west side of Broadway beneath the Interstate 40 viaduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| to construct the Broadway-Magnolia Avenue safe space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Can we just get, I think, Ms. Wade to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| I think when I was reading this I was trying to figure out if it was a different part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| And so for the public, if we could clarify, this is the same space that's already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| it's just about the timing of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| Pardon me, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| This is the same space that is currently being used for the safe space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| We had requested the license agreement probably eight months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| and it just took a while for the state to actually send us that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| But activities are right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4050)|

| 1:14:19| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| I see Chad and Patience in the audience there, and we've received correspondence I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| was very helpful, but could you talk a little bit about why we needed this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| I know this is a popular program and just had concerns about sort of the future of recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| and where that product is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Patience Melnick, Solid Waste Manager in the Public Service Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| So recently Westrock declined to renew the contract that we had in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| They did so because the rate that we were paying, $10 a ton, wasn't enough for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| to conduct business with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| The reason for that is essentially these materials that we're collecting are commodities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| and just across the board they have plummeted due to some changes out of China that went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| into effect at the beginning of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| We are very, very fortunate here in the southeast and particularly in eastern Tennessee because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| we do have really good markets for these materials still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| When you read national news and you hear about communities that are losing their recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| if you look closely, they're typically places along the coasts where their materials were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| being shipped to China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| So we're really fortunate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| Our prices are not going up like they have in many other cities across the country, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| there's a local need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| We have local buyers for those materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| This was outlined, but just for the public's sake, our aluminum is going to Arconic down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| in Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Our steel is going to Gerdau Ameristeel here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| Our plastics are going to Mohawk Carpets, which is in northern Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| And then Westrock itself, they're our recyclables processor, but their primary business is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4576)|
| 1:16:25| they're one of the biggest packaging companies in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| So they're taking what we call our fibers, our paper, our cardboard, our paperboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| and essentially purchasing that themselves and using that to make packaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| So while the cost is going up from $10 a ton to $24 a ton, when you compare us to a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| of other communities, even as close as Memphis, which is at $95 a ton, Lexington is $80 a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4606)|
| 1:16:54| ton, we really are fortunate that we have markets, still strong markets, for these materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| So over the next five years or so, we could see prices even increase for these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4621)|
| 1:17:08| I mean, what's the long-term prognosis in terms of the recycling program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4628)|
| 1:17:15| I mean, do you see any changes coming in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Well, I don't think it's in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| This contract is for five years total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| It's a one-year contract with four one-year renewals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| And under the structure of the contract, every year the cost could go up another 6%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4648)|
| 1:17:36| depending on the health of the markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| And people who know a lot more than I do about these markets are predicting that the fiber markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| are going to continue to be down for at least another two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| And I should say that we reference the fiber markets most often because it makes up the biggest portion of our stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4669)|
| 1:17:57| So that's kind of the most important indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| So I personally would expect that we're going to pay that 6% for the next two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| After that, it's anybody's guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| They do say that there are new paper mills, I think 17, either coming online or being expanded in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| in response to the fact that paper right now is about $0 a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| It's practically free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| And so they are seeing the market respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| 11P is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville authorizing the mayor to execute a purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| and sale agreement with Metro Knoxville HMA LLC for the acquisition of real property located at 900 East Oak Hill Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4720)|
| 1:18:48| for the purpose of building a public safety complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| I do want to just say for the public, so this and the four after this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| all of these five resolutions are all dealing with the former St. Mary's, the Tenova property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| and the potential for a public safety complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| So we'll be dealing with that for five resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| I just think this is a great opportunity, the way this has continued to develop for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| and for the city in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| It's going to have a great impact on the business community up in that area in the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| It's got great support from Knox Heritage, Oakwood Lincoln Park neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| North Knoxville Business and Professionals Association, the Broadway Corridor Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| and many others that see the potential for this site redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| And the news of LMU coming online and recruitment with rising juniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| and seniors partnering with Fulton High School and police and fire recruitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| it keeps getting better, so I'm very supportive and thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| I do want to, I forgot to mention that George Bovee is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| He, Bovee, sorry, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| How do you pronounce it, Bovee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| He was here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| Would you like to speak, George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| You're the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| I say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Please state your name and address for the record and if you'd watch the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| I'm George Bovee, 1800 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| Bovee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| We're going to do it that way today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| I had it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I can tell you without any hesitation that the membership of the North Knoxville Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| and Professional Association, which takes in, you know as well as I do, the neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| the businesses, the nonprofits, the for-profits, thankfully I work for one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| and all the rest are unanimous in support of this, and we are excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4838)|
| 1:20:46| We're excited that we could possibly have our chiefs living in our neighborhood every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| and coming to our neighborhood to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| and we're excited about the fact that we could maintain this property where Mayor Tyree's three children were born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4853)|
| 1:21:02| We want to recognize and thank Mayor Tyree for being here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| That's right, and I think Councilman Roberto's two children were born at that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| so we want to keep a good roof over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| I say it jokingly, but in all honesty, without any reservation, the complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4873)|
| 1:21:22| and keeping that site healthy will continue to keep Uptown North headed in the direction that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4882)|
| 1:21:32| and will only be another conduit to its success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| and I'm asking you humbly on behalf of the entire membership for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| George, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| One George to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Yeah, next George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| I'm not debating the merits of this project or whether we should relocate KFD and KPD or the city court to East Oak Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4913)|
| 1:22:02| I think I want to discuss really a better process and offer a better opportunity to achieve better results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| I'm not really here to debate the how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| I really want to talk about how, not necessarily talk about why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| I think you've made a great presentation over the last few months on the why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| and I think there's a better way to do the how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| I think there's three reasons that I'm opposed to it as it's presented to us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| and those three are that I don't believe that the city of Knoxville needs to be in the development business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| I think the government should do what the private sector cannot, and the private sector can and will develop this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| The redevelopment of East Hill Avenue is very similar to the former Baptist site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| The surrounding neighborhoods were both fragile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| and I would argue that the south Knoxville properties were even more fragile than Oakwood-Lincoln Park at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4971)|
| 1:22:59| Their large, functional, obsolete buildings with parking garages are going to require significant demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| A private company developed Baptist Hospital site, and except for the Riverwalk improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| the city of Knoxville did not put money towards demolition or towards acquiring the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| Private developers took care of that, and private developers carved out what they wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| and we were able to carve out what is now the Regal Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| So there's no excess property left over to be redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| Because in this case, there will be significant property and buildings left over that will be excess properties for us to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5010)|
| 1:23:38| We're not good developers, and we shouldn't be in that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| The second thing is if we want to build it, we can build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| If we build it new, we can build it for less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| If we want to have a state-of-the-art building for fire, police, and a city court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| we need to build it new and not renovate an old medical building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| We can have a building that's specifically designed for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| that will last the city a lot longer than 50 years if we build it new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| If we build it new, we can have a guaranteed construction price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| and the design and the functionality will not be compromised with a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| Rest assured, when you renovate a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| you will have functional compromises that you will live with for the rest of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| And we can even build it on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| We don't have to build it somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| I don't disagree with the site location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| But there's no amount of renovation will make a 20-year-old building new again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| Ceiling heights, the footprint, the support columns cannot change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| and even the design of the HVAC and how it functions will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| Our building codes have changed since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| and we have approved those significant changes right here on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| It's not limited to structural changes like seismic requirements or energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| And a new building would have modern design, and a renovation is a short-term fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| The third thing is when the city of Knoxville owns the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| it becomes inherently more difficult to redevelop it or repurpose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| There are more rules and more ordinances in play and more time, more meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| more, more, more, and yet the results are not better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| There's other ways to complete this project without taking ownership of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| We have proven to ourselves that we are not good developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| and you need to look no further than the State Supreme Court site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| and the Jackson Avenue and McClung warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| We've been working on the State Supreme Court site my full eight years on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| and we've bought the Jackson Avenue and McClung warehouses since we've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| Both those properties still remain unimproved and vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| The better deal and the better way to get a better price is a net deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| Put out an RFP for a 200,000-square-foot building to house fire police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| and we will have skilled developers from across this country bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| It's a AAA-rated city, and we will attract quality developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| We can set the parameters, the size, the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| and the buildings delivered at a fixed price subject to change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| It's the best way for us to get the best product and the most competitive price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| It's a tried and proven method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| Two recent developments in Knoxville have been done this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| the TVA West Tower and the FBI building in Dow Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| So over the last few months, I've toured it with Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| I've talked to a number of engineers, architects, real estate developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| that I know in the business that I've been in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| and I can't find any significant support from this group of experienced professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| for the city of Knoxville to take on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| I think there are too many unknowns, there are too many uncertainties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| and there are too many hidden costs for it to be in the best interest of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| and the way it's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| I think there's a lot of caution, and I think there's better ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| I would pause and look for better opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| Part of this project involves, and we'll get into this in a later agenda item in 11R,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5246)|
| 1:27:34| but part of this involves the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| and I wanted to just let everybody know that the executive boards from West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| and Wesley Neighbors expressed their support for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| I know that Donny Ernst, who's the president of West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| will address that when we get to this next, with the 11R issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| Some of the issues that Councilmember Wallace raised, I think, are very good points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| and the unknowns and the uncertainties that could be out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| I think, are legitimate questions for us to deal with today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| So I would imagine, Mr. Brace, you're probably the right one to ask this question of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| I would imagine in buildings of this age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| we're probably looking at there being some environmental hazards that might be in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| lead paint, asbestos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| This may not be unfamiliar territory for some of the things that have been dealt with in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| but could you address for us what kind of testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| or what's been going on to address those types of issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| Absolutely. Thank you, Councilman Roberto, and I appreciate the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| Councilman Wallace, we've had a similar dialogue both on the tour and in my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| and I appreciate, obviously, the sharp eye and the criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| We need to obviously do what's right for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| I will say that, number one, we've been looking at sites throughout the city for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5336)|
| 1:29:04| This was the next real opportunity for the city from an operational perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| to consolidate and be more efficient with police, fire, and municipal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| We have done our homework, and we have hired a team to go in and do an assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| The buildings that we are renovating, two of them are office buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| and they're in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| They're structurally sound with a 700-space parking garage that is in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| And so the estimates that we did on the building included fully gutting these buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| and fully installing modern HVAC systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| They are fed on a very old boiler system, a two-pipe system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| So it's removing all of that, individually servicing each building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| So there's two office buildings and a modern medical facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| which has good column widths, good ceiling heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| So those office buildings and the medical building where, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| where the birthing center was are in very good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| And so we have done the estimates to fully remove every piece from inside those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| We had that estimate done, that assessment done by Benefield Rectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| We then had that assessment reviewed by Volkert Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| That is our owner's rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| During that process, we have also worked with Tony Benton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| Mr. Benton is here, and the team from Tenova and legal counsel for Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| And they have turned over all of their environmental documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| Obviously, as a working hospital, they're required to know what hazardous materials they have in their buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5436)|
| 1:30:43| And so they had many assessments done, and they turned those over to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| We, Jonathan Grammer with Volkert Engineering is our owner's rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| The purchase and sale agreement includes a 120-day due diligence period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| And if you look later down your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| QE2 is the environmental engineering firm that we will use and hire through this contract on the city council agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5461)|
| 1:31:09| to go in and help us with that due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| And so we believe that the information we have in the due diligence period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| will give us significant comfort in moving forward with some of those unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| The buildings we are looking at are not dissimilar to Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| Lakeshore Park was a medical facility that had very similar facilities and aged buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| We did assessment, we did abatement, and we demolished those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| And that was all within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| It is very similar on a more compact campus, actually, with many newer buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| So we feel comfortable that the numbers are realistic, that they have been assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| So the Benefield-Richter's numbers were then taken by Volkert Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| and Volkert actually assembled Glenn-Richter's and Benefield-Richter's in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| at their headquarter offices, I believe, in Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| They also scrutinized those numbers and looked at every piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| looked at the square footage and the programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| And so those numbers were looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| We would not bring you something that we did not feel comfortable with from a budget perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| This is also an important investment in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| I think the ability for us to leverage relationships with Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| met with Principal Rob Spies, and with the LMU opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| There's one large building that we don't need, a nine-story concrete building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| that LMU would like to keep their nursing program there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| So the collective effort, the due diligence period, I feel very comfortable this is the right decision for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| and I'm obviously here recommending that with the mayor and other city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| So has there been testing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| I know the Tenova folks have revealed to you what they know of as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| and the reason we're talking about this is really because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| if you ended up having to do abatement for asbestos or you had some other issue like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| the cost could really increase significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| So I think on the front end, this is a good thing for us to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| But have you been disclosed what's there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| Have you heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| Have you done testing as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| So what we have done is we have walked through with an environmental firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Until they're under contract with us, we don't want to do more invasive testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| So Tenova has turned every record they're aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| and every assessment they're aware of over to our team, as well as plans for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| And totally open book with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| We now, the due diligence period, is to get someone on board to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| and punch holes in the floor to test materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| We know there's asbestos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| The age of the building is just like there was lots of asbestos and materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| in other buildings that we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| We're an urban city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| We're a city, excuse me, with buildings that have materials that have to be abated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| We do it routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| I think Becky Wade had a lead-based paint program earlier that she reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| It happens in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| It's nothing that, none of the materials we're aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| and that we will be looking into over the next 120 days with QE2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| None of the materials we're aware of now, we're concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| They have to be abated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| We've done those estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| Glenn Richter's and Volkert Engineering, Jonathan Grammer, if you'll raise your hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Jonathan is with Volkert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| One reason we hired Volkert, we want this project to be on budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| and we want this project to run smoothly and efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| We brought in a big firm to help us with that that does very large projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| So we've already looked at what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| We've walked the building multiple times with the staff of Tenova, their facilities staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| and we have also obviously going to have QE2 on board during this 120-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| So I feel very comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Now, look, if we find something in the next 120 days with QE2 that is of real concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5689)|
| 1:34:57| we would not move forward with the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| We would have to sit back down and work with law and legal counsel and Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| We don't anticipate that happening, but we must trust and verify, and QE2 will help us verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| So the due diligence period of 120 days would begin upon passage of these agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5709)|
| 1:35:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| I mean, what we'll need to do is get the contracts signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| and insurance certificates, and the law department knows that this project needs to move quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| and so we'll do that as expeditiously as possible, and they will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| I mean, Jonathan is in town now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| He was actually at the site today, Jonathan, with McCarty, Wholesapple McCarty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| which is his design team, and I believe QE2 on site looking at the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| They know that we want to move very efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| KPD is in a very challenged building that has real maintenance problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| boilers that are struggling and plumbing that really can't be repaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| and so we need to move for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| But we have the due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| We've done our homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| We've got more homework to do, but I believe at the end of the day that we'll feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| and move forward with that purchase and sale agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| And just one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| I'd like to ask that before the 120-day period ends that you come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| and give us a report on what your findings were and identify anything that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| and I know you'll be doing this behind the scenes, but I think it's important for everyone to hear that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| and if there are issues, then let's deal with it openly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| I anticipate that this project, like many of our larger capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| will have a website dedicated to it so that those documents, that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| especially over the next 120 days, that information can be revealed to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| Everything that we would do in the building with QE2, we would keep open and come back and report to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| So I'll sit down with, assuming that these items pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| I will sit down with Jonathan and come up with a schedule to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| and routinely update Council, not only on the 120 days, but should it move forward with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| Thank you, Mr. Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Councilwoman Singh-Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Building on what Councilman Wallace was asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| there are certain parts of the property that are going to be redeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| but the city is going to find a purchaser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| The city won't be doing the redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| So there's really two projects here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| There's the South Campus, which is where we envision and believe that KPD and KFD will fit very nicely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5849)|
| 1:37:37| into Old North, Oakwood-Lincoln Park, and next to Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| Then there's the North Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| The Tower Building is the building that we're in very good negotiations with right now with LMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5863)|
| 1:37:52| It's a little interesting to be negotiating with someone when you don't own the building yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| but Mr. Dubusque has come to us and asked about this, should this deal move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| And then there are very old, antiquated buildings that are vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| and haven't been used as a hospital for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| And so our plan calls for abating and demolishing those facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| except for the historic hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| There's a rectangular core 1929 hospital building that Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| I see is over here in the corner, has walked with us, saved that historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| And that site, I think, again, the abatement and demolition, we will be into the next mayor's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| whoever that mayor is, term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| And I would envision advising them that that would be master planned either by the city or by KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5909)|
| 1:38:36| master planned for what the community would see as appropriate and what the market may bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| and then redeveloped and back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| So could the market take care of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| I believe it will be a significant number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| I think Baptist was nine plus years, and there was a TIF associated with that, the regal deal next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| So there aren't direct dollars in the Baptist site, but there's lots around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| and it's also on the water right next to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| So will the market take care of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| It could, but I think you will have a site of disinvestment in a neighborhood for a decade or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| that could be very detrimental for the Broadway corridor and for Central and Oakwood-Lincoln Park and Old North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5954)|
| 1:39:23| The tower that LMU will be using, hopefully, would that be a lease or a purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| We don't need the building, and demolishing that building costs, our estimates are around $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5968)|
| 1:39:34| So what I would envision is should the purchase and sale agreement go through, it would be in a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| We would ask Ben Bentley with KCDC to develop and negotiate with LMU on that building some type of acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5980)|
| 1:39:49| The city doesn't need it, and I don't think we want to hold on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| We'd like to get it back into the market, and Mr. DeBuss seems to be a very likely candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| but he would need to negotiate an appropriate agreement that would go through KCDC and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| I believe the city council, Mr. Swanson, would come to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| So that would be, again, approved by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| Right now there are about 165 nursing students and staff at St. Mary's that he would like to keep there and move into the first few floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6014)|
| 1:40:24| He also has expressed an interest in moving the criminal justice program there and some business school there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6024)|
| 1:40:33| and he's very interested in working with our police department if he has criminal justice programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| our fire department, could he provide some training, and more importantly, Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| So with what Councilman Wallace was asking about, we will only own the property at the end when this is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| We will only own the property that the safety building is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| The rest of it will be bid out for redevelopment and purchased, and it won't be ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| No, I think the idea is we keep just what we need, and we take care of the abatement and demolition to get it market-ready faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6058)|
| 1:41:07| So the abatement and demolition happens, you've got a building that's a centerpiece, a historic building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| and then that is returned to the market through, again, I would envision, and again, the next mayor will have to decide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| that won't be me, the next mayor would have to decide that, a master planning process, neighborhood input, market viability for the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| and again, that north campus needs to get back onto the tax rolls, into the private sector hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| I think we're infusing dollars, the mayor is recommending infusing money to help make the market work faster by abating and demolishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6090)|
| 1:41:39| One last concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| So we're really, with this project, we're not only building a safety building, which is something that we need for all the departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| but we're also trying to take care of an area that has been not doing so well lately in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| so it's two-fold in purchasing the whole site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| Yeah, I think that's a good summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| I think Mayor Rojero has said this, and Dr. Lyons, we're investing $40 million, and we need to invest $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6119)|
| 1:42:06| That was approved in last budget year, fiscal year, or current fiscal year, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| Where we put that $40 matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| If we're going to invest $40, the mayor has always said, let's invest it in a location that not only impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| and meets the needs of KPD and KFD and city court, and then later we add the pension office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| Pension office is a relatively small footprint, a few thousand square feet, 3,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| The pension office, but we've got to also invest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| We should invest it in an area that will also help the market return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| and stabilize a part of town that has seen disinvestment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| The areas that we looked at, all of you are aware of Knoxville College, an area of disinvestment, Mechanicsville and Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| The other was we knew St. Mary's and Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| That site was declining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| And then, honestly, we also were discussing the Fulton High School, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| the rural high school site between Lonsdale and Beaumont, Western Heights area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| Those are areas in our city where there's significant disinvestment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| And so, ultimately, the St. Mary's, historic St. Mary's, Tenova site is really worked out well for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6186)|
| 1:43:14| and we believe will meet the needs and be a modern professional facility for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| It's got a great parking garage, it's office building, it's going to be gutted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| and it's going to be a modern professional top-notch building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| I share Councilmember Campin's excitement on this project of turning a vacant and blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6211)|
| 1:43:38| into a property that's got good office jobs in a fragile neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| and especially with LMU coming along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| There have been some concerns raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| So the city never really did consider an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| Is that correct, and can you explain a little bit why that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| I think it's important to note I'm not aware of a city that sends an RFP out and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| we want to build a building for KPD, you tell us where it will be, and build the building and give us a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| I'm not aware of a procurement for a safety building like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| Everything that all the contracts that you're looking at have gone through a purchasing department procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6253)|
| 1:44:21| So Benefield-Richter's was hired as a professional services contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| It was small enough that we could do that directly with Benefield-Richter's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| Everything else has been let through our purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| and I've not been involved in that decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| So the selection of an owner's representative was done through an RFQ, RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| Mr. Evans is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| The selection of McCarty Hulsapple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| McCarty is on here as the designers, and David Collins is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| That was through an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| The selection of QE2, and QE2 is here as well, was done through a procurement RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6292)|
| 1:45:00| We will be selecting a construction manager at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| That is going on right now as a procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| It's competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| All of the construction will be through a procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| So every piece of this, just like any complicated large redevelopment, will be done with procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| And so to say that the entire project is thrown out and we do a lowest bidder model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6319)|
| 1:45:27| that is oftentimes not the way to do projects efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| I think we have been successful with the CM at risk where we bring the contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| and they can only self-perform, I believe, 20 percent of the project, looking at Boyce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| and we bring the designer on board at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| So instead of designing a building with McCarty and they do some estimating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| and then putting it out for bid and hoping it comes in budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| we design with the contractor at the same time so that we can keep costs under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| And so that is the model that we will be working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| But every aspect of the project will be procured through our normal processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| So take me through that again because I think the cost is the other big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| So did Volcker come up with the original estimates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| The original estimates were based on a couple of things that I had really inherited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| when I stepped into this role, which is the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| and the fire department thought they would need about 200,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| They were looking at both new and renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| estimating about $200 a square foot turnkey, very broad estimate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| And so we still feel comfortable with that $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| And the first thing we asked Volcker and Benefield Rectors, first Benefield Rectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| is does the site work for KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| We don't need to be trying to cram the round peg through the square hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| Does it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| And Glenn came back and said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| It's repurposing office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| And he did an assessment of KPD's programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| The second thing was can we afford it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| And he did an assessment of our budget and looked at that, and then Volcker looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| So Benfield's looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| Volcker's looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| Has McCarty also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| Well, McCarty will come on board, and they will come on board as the designers for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6430)|
| 1:47:16| And then very soon in the future, assuming that these pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| what you will see is a construction manager at risk contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| Is that right, Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| We'll have a contractor that will come before and work with the designers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| And I believe you were on the site today with contractors, Jonathan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| So he was there with a host of contractors walking the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| They are preparing their proposals to be the contractor that will carry this project through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| McCarty will be the designers that, again, will be doing a couple of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| getting every single document that we've obtained from Tenova, the existing plans, all the environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| And then they're really going to sit back down with KPD and, again, review programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| Programming is uses, square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| What are the uses, and what is the square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| And then you've got specialty items within KPD, how we store evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| how we bring evidence into that storage, how we interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| and is interrogation still a word to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| Interrogate and interview people that are suspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| That's what's happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| I'm good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| So those are some specialty items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| A lot of this is office space, professional office space that has a very high level of security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| because we know law enforcement, you know, just needs that security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| And a new city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| That's another part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| Judge Rawson needed a court where folks could come in, single lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| So as these new entities come on, if they come on and look at the budget and estimates to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| and they feel like it's way short, what do we do then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| Are we in a position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| Can I just interrupt for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| Deputy Finance Director but formerly the purchasing agent for about 12 1⁄2 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6547)|
| 1:49:15| Number one, Volcker, who does this all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| has indeed confirmed that we can do what we need to do for the budget that has been set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6560)|
| 1:49:30| Secondly, the big benefit from having an owner's representative and then the CM at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6570)|
| 1:49:44| which is it's kind of a different procurement style, but, again, it's done all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| It came into vogue probably about five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| One of the big benefits with that is you've got the owner's rep who's making sure everybody stays in budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| and you bring on the architect or the engineering firm or both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| and they have to work during the planning stage with the owner's rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| And, oh, by the way, you get the CM at risk in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| so you've got the construction firm, the prime, that's going to be looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| You have all three of them looking at the design, working that at the same time, looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| seeing are we getting out of tolerance on the budget and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| Suffice it to say that the model that we are using where they all have to work together during the planning stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6627)|
| 1:50:34| under the umbrella of the owner's representative is to make sure that we don't go out of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6634)|
| 1:50:42| That's how one of the key advantages to this model is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| so you don't have, I don't know, a professional engineer or architect firm that, we've all seen this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| that designs something that you can't afford and then you have to get into value engineering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| You take care of all that during the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| Okay. Thank you for providing that. That was helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| So, you know, with that, I'm supportive of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| I think it is, I think it seems like everyone agrees that we do need a new facility for police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| We haven't even really, that doesn't even seem to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| So this seems like a good location. It's central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| We're addressing a blighted property that's mostly vacant or soon to be vacant in a fragile neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6685)|
| 1:51:32| So I think it's the right move and I'm glad to support it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| Thank you. Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Yeah. So obviously this is my neighborhood, but it's not my district. It's across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6699)|
| 1:51:47| Everyone in my community that I've heard from supports this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| The people who haven't supported it are people not tangentially located to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| In my community, we have long been grappling with and fighting against losing our largest employer, our health care, our ER, our doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6718)|
| 1:52:09| People who live there worked at this hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| This has been a big blow and a major, incredible disinvestment to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6734)|
| 1:52:22| We came down here and fought against it when the rezoning happened on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| We fought hard, but we can't fight the reality of what health care is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| And that's not about Knoxville. That's not about Tenova or St. Mary's or Mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| That's about this country, this world and health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| And that's a whole other week's worth of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| So I'm going to go down that pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| This gets very personal for me for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| For one thing, at one point when my husband was affiliated with that hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| other doctors said when there was conversation long before the public even was talking about that hospital moving and leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| and the North facility was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| The comments that were made by physicians, many who do not live in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| were one of the few that lived there, that was a physician affiliated there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| was that this was a crappy neighborhood and we needed to get out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| And my husband said, I live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| We live there because we love this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| We think it's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| And it's painful to watch people live and vacate and think you're a bad place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| What I do hear from my constituents, in addition to concerns about the disinvestment and the leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| is that they always want more police presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| That's something I hear repeatedly over and over again, knocking doors, talking to constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| going to meetings, e-mails, on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| So this has been welcomed and it's asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| I appreciate people's concerns about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| Trust me, I've lost plenty of sleep and I've agonized about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| including the people who want this to happen there agonize about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| I don't want to take lightly the cost and what it takes to repay it, but I think it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| My tour of the facilities and the fact that we're scattered to the three winds across town for these service lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| that are our core services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| This is why we exist as government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| This is what we provide as fire, police, the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| It's warranted and it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| I appreciate and understand the conversation about building new from the ground up versus rehabbing existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6868)|
| 1:54:37| but I also say that that makes everything that we've done and invested very heavily in that's rebuilt Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| and made it what it is, it speaks against all of that that we've invested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| I really do appreciate those comments from George and from the folks who don't live in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| I'm not knocking them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| They don't live walking distance from this that say that it must be cheaper to do it elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| And in my mind, I think about the fact that the county just announced they're going to build three schools for $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| We're going to rehab five plus buildings for $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| So if you take it very simplistically, they're not that far removed from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| It doesn't sound that outlandish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| And I've been over and over again meeting with David to, you know, go through the price points and talk about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6919)|
| 1:55:26| How have they been arrived at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| The Benefil-Richter numbers were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| The Volkert came in and said they were a little bit, you know, less and more on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| And I've reiterated when meeting with Mr. Brace my concerns that we stay within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| I don't want to take the taxpayers in the city down a pathway that ends up being more expensive than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6941)|
| 1:55:50| And one more note on vacant and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| If the market could take care of all of those, we wouldn't have standard knitting mills still sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| We wouldn't have rural high school cysts still sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| We've got the Social Security building sitting there on Central across the street from the old Sears building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| We've got the Palm Beach Mill outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| We've got – we're eaten up with vacant and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| And we're not on a river, and we don't have the best views in town, but we have access to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6979)|
| 1:56:28| And there's a lot going for this site that I think makes it the right site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| And if we're going to spend $40 million on a facility, we could build it on a greenfield, or we could solve a blighted property problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| And that's why I'm supporting this for that reason and all the others that I just stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7000)|
| 1:56:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| First of all, I just want to note how much I appreciate the conversation that Council has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| It's just respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| People make really good points, and I just want to note that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| And I also particularly was sort of reflecting on what I heard Councilman Wallace say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7020)|
| 1:57:08| It made me think differently about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| I may not be in agreement, but I started to reflect on particularly when I heard the comparison with the Baptist Hospital site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7032)|
| 1:57:21| because I do think that there's something to reflect on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| When I think about how we're using our public tax dollars, when we know that we're going to spend money on something as important as a public safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7044)|
| 1:57:35| I think it's important to be strategic about how those dollars are invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| The strategic investment of those public dollars needs to, first of all, have a public benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7059)|
| 1:57:47| and it also has the potential of stimulating private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| And we've seen that in South Knoxville, and I think the Baptist Hospital site is a great example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| It may be in a little bit of a different context than what Councilman Wallace was referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| but I think that that site would not have been developed in the way that it has been if it were not for the public investment that happened as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7083)|
| 1:58:13| So that was a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| The city very strategically invested in infrastructure, parks, and tax increment financing for the Regal Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7096)|
| 1:58:27| and I think that the public investment and the public benefit that's come from that is a great example of how being strategic with our dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7107)|
| 1:58:36| when we know we have to invest them, in my opinion, is a good way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7116)|
| 1:58:42| And I see this as a very similar type of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| We know that we're going to build a public safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| We've already approved that as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| We know that we're looking at an area that has experienced disinvestment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| and there are concerns from the surrounding neighborhoods and from the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| I also lived in that neighborhood for a short period of time and experienced that myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| And what I see here is that, at least from my perspective, we're talking about strategic investment in that neighborhood that has a public benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7147)|
| 1:59:20| and the potential for stimulating private sector investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| And in the meantime, we get a very needed facility for our police, fire, pension, courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7165)|
| 1:59:32| multiple offices that can be consolidated into one site, which I think helps improve the efficiency of government as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7172)|
| 1:59:39| So I also support this project, and those are just some of the reasons why I could reflect on others that I've heard from others on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7179)|
| 1:59:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| Thank you. Let me call on Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| I will second what Councilwoman Welsh has just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| This has been a very vigorous discussion, and I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| I am comfortable with the project as proposed, and I'm certainly going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7200)|
| 2:00:07| But the things that have been mentioned here tonight reinforce what I've thought about this council for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| and that is that we will have a discussion and we will listen to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| We may or may not agree, but then we will make a decision, and that's something that cannot be said of all political bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7217)|
| 2:00:25| So I really appreciate this, but I am going to be supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| And I am sensitive to the comments that Councilwoman Wallace has made because sometimes I think the market needs a nudge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7231)|
| 2:00:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| Thank you. Councilwoman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| Thank you. Mr. Rice, I'll go back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| I mean, do you expect surprises when you start peeling off the sheetrock and the studs and you start peeling it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| Do you expect surprises in those buildings that are unforeseen, that no engineer has seen yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| And when you really start peeling it all back and you get it, do you expect surprises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| I don't expect materials that would not normally be in a building of the age of the buildings on this campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7264)|
| 2:01:13| Now, look, if we find out, we dig something up, and we find out somebody at St. Mary's had a good friend at K-25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7273)|
| 2:01:19| and they're spent uranium on the site, we will not be moving forward with this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| I'm not talking about those kinds of surprises, but, you know, there's always structural surprises, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| There's always surprises when you start peeling back the layers of the sheetrock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| So I expect surprises. I mean, is there contingency for those surprises when you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7291)|
| 2:01:38| So we have an overall project contingency of 8%, which on a large project like this is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7298)|
| 2:01:44| So we've included contingencies throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| Again, the 120 days is to go in with our designers who will be under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| You know, Glenn Rector's was the 10,000 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| We're going to get boots on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| We're going to go in. We're going to punch holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| We're going to rip up floors. We're going to test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| We're going to have the professional engineers go in, excuse me, the architects and engineers go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7322)|
| 2:02:09| and look for anything like that that is going to cause me heartache or the city heartache later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| That's the whole point of the 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| Get QE2, get our designers on board, get them in the building, and start digging into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7338)|
| 2:02:24| And that's what Jonathan is paid to do every single day is to make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| And we've got time to do that before we close, and I will come back and update city council on our findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| But we feel we've been through the building a significant number of times with designers, with engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| and we feel that the three buildings we are repurposing, two office buildings, a 700 space parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| and the women's pavilion, which is three floors of a concrete building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| we believe those are in very good condition for what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| Now, we've got to gut them. We've got to establish utilities, all new utility services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| So that's got to happen, but we feel very comfortable right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| But the 120 days is to dig into that and figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| So do you think you'll get a fixed contract price for renovation of those buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| I mean, you'll get a fixed price for the demolition, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| So I'm going to turn this over to Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| I believe we will do a maximum not to exceed. Is that right, Boyce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| During the planning stage, which I was talking about based on a question that was asked earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7406)|
| 2:03:34| where the architects and the owner's rep and the CM at risk are on board, not so much there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7414)|
| 2:03:43| but afterwards, you know, as they get firms up, they have to submit, I think it's a guaranteed maximum price, GMP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7423)|
| 2:03:57| And that, they can't go over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| If they go over it, it's on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| That's why it's the CM at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| That's where the term comes from, because they're at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| But that will be during this, as Mr. Brace is talking about, the 120 days, looking at everything, figuring it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7449)|
| 2:04:20| Then the CM at risk will give us their guaranteed maximum price, but they'll have to stick to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7460)|
| 2:04:26| So does that guaranteed maximum price cover material increases that may happen over the term of the construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7466)|
| 2:04:31| It covers everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| That's why they're at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| And if they go over it, then they've got to pony up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| Good thing about tech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| So Jonathan in the back said the guaranteed maximum price will be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| And they've emphasized this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| And do you think that guaranteed maximum is going to be $40 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| The guaranteed maximum as of today, and again, we've got to get into 120 days, is $35.5 million for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| And so, and again, you've got to remember, there's FF&E, there's design costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7497)|
| 2:05:02| So when you look at that maximum price, that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| But they're now meeting with the, that's what our budget is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| They're meeting with the contractors for this CM at risk model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| The whole point of that is you design and you estimate together versus design, bid out, and hope it's in budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7514)|
| 2:05:21| And if you get the low bidder and they just change order you, that's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| And so we feel comfortable to CM at risk with this complicated project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| A large project is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| We did that on the public works complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| We did a CM at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| And that was really the first time we'd done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| But it was new out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| Well, it was new and renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| We renovated one, two, three buildings on that site, the fleet buildings, the horticulture building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7542)|
| 2:05:49| But the main part of that project was new out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| The building was new, but the fleet building was a significant project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| And we, I mean, I think the model we have with the guaranteed maximum price is what we're driving towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7557)|
| 2:06:04| And I can say this, that you save money on design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| You're not going to save it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| The building has to be designed to budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| And if you keep your design in budget, it should come out in construction in budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7572)|
| 2:06:19| Now, look, are there things that could happen that could we have a war in the Middle East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| and, you know, oil goes to $500 a barrel and steel shoots up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| There are unforeseens that could happen with any project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| But that's covered by the CM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7594)|
| 2:06:35| That's what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| That's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| Once we get the guaranteed maximum price, but that takes a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| We've got to work to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| But once you get the guaranteed maximum price, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| You don't exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| Because that's the difference between a fixed price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| If we built it new, we would have a guaranteed price, except for change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| Except for change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| Except for change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| They happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| They happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| And they could happen with a guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| But that would, if we, the city, asked for some, I don't know, a new room or something that was here before unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7625)|
| 2:07:12| Yeah, but on new construction on that, it goes, that's what I'm driving at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| The prices are fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| So if oil goes crazy and steel goes crazy, then those prices are fixed and the contractor is at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| Well, you're saying the CM is at risk in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| If those prices go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| The CM at risk is at risk for the guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| Once we have that and the contract is fully executed, it's on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7650)|
| 2:07:36| I'd like to break in, if it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| I think there's one thing we have to keep in context, and that is we have experience here, both publicly and in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7658)|
| 2:07:45| and recently, of renovating much older office buildings into really tremendous new buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| And we've never heard in the case, I'm thinking of Tombrus, which was KUB, old, had environmental challenges, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7671)|
| 2:07:59| very successfully renovated and entirely new systems, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| And also the city did what the building Regal's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| And both of them had the similarity that we had virtually the shells kept, but everything else put in new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| which is very much what we're doing here, which are office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| I'm not sure of their age, but they're, I think, in the 70s, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| We could look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7700)|
| 2:08:21| But these are office buildings reconverted to office use with those models out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| And I'm glad Councilman Ryder raised that not only do we have success with those, but we've had successful buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| most of them staying within budget, renovations with all new systems all over our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| So I think the fact that we're renovating is a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| I have one other aspect that hasn't been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| It's always better not to tear down from an environmental point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| It's always superior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| You don't have all the materials to worry about disposing of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| And so from a sustainability perspective, really pleased we can save every single building that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| and especially pleased, of course, it's on the other end of campus about the old historic hospital building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7738)|
| 2:09:06| Yeah, so what's the timetable to redevelop and repurpose the rest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| You're going to use about nine acres, and then you're going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| the way I remember their presentation a few months ago, you're going to have about nine acres of property left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| So how are you going to go, what's the timetable to repurpose that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| I mean, that's really some of our biggest risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| Well, that's going to be, that will go into the next administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| and we're already talking with KCDC about handling that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| I think that would involve a significant amount of community input as to what would happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| and I think that could become started, you know, really, as this building were being completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7776)|
| 2:09:42| or even before that, with the input process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| Again, the neighborhood is right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| We want to be very sensitive to those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| We want to make sure that we get good reuse for the old hospital building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| and there's no reason they can't begin fairly quickly as the KPD and KFD court construction begins to come to a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7793)|
| 2:10:03| Yeah, I think part of that will happen very rapidly should the LMU discussions move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| That tower building starting to be renovated and occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| what happened could be as early as the first quarter of the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| I think one thing that I would like to get counsel is, as they bring on, assuming that this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| I don't want to be presumptuous, but QE2 and the designers on board is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| one thing Jonathan will be doing is, you know, roughing in and refining the master schedule for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| and give him a few weeks to clean that up and get it out to you so you can start to see the sequence of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| And again, the designers and QE2 will help drive that now, assuming they are on board here after these votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7839)|
| 2:10:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| I wanted to ask Mr. Volkert if he, you moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| Did you have something you wanted to contribute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| That's actually Jonathan Grammer, and he works for Volkert Engineering, and I think he'd probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| If you want to answer to that, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| I just wanted to reiterate that, like David said, during our due diligence period to address Councilman Wallace's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7866)|
| 2:11:13| on the structure of the facilities, those three buildings that we plan to reuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| when we go in there with QE2 and with McCarty to start doing our due diligence and investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| we've already done some of that, minimally invasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| We will get more into some destructive testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| You're going to cut holes in the walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| We will do some of that, minimally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| We don't want to tear too much up in case something happens and we don't follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| We'll have to repair it for Tenova, but we're going to do some of that to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| and try to get comfortable that some of the things that Councilman Wallace is concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7902)|
| 2:11:47| the surprises you mentioned, that we don't have those surprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| So we're going to be diligent in checking all those things to make sure that we're not getting into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7912)|
| 2:11:58| that is going to blow the budget from what we've already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| So we will spend the next three to four months checking things to make sure that we're all comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| because the last thing that we want to do is come back to you and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| wait a minute, the money we thought we could do this for, we can't do it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| Y'all have already signed a contract, purchased a property, and we're all in a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| So we're going to be looking out for the city's best interest to make sure that the money y'all have allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7939)|
| 2:12:26| to do what you want to do on that site, that we're going to be able to do it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| If we find a reason that we can't do it for that, I'm going to let David know as soon as we find out that there's an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7949)|
| 2:12:36| and we won't get you into a bad position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| The only other comment I wanted to make, thank you, was Mr. Lyons just touched upon it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7962)|
| 2:12:47| If this property were purchased in a hypothetical, if it were purchased by a private industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7967)|
| 2:12:56| there would be no community process or public input into what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| As it stands, with the city being the developer, as Councilman Wallace says, which is true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7981)|
| 2:13:11| is there's public process for what happens for that, in essence, full city block on the backside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7991)|
| 2:13:18| as well as the hospital where all their children were born and their loved ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| all the emotions that are tied to this property for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| That's what everybody says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| Everybody has an emotional investment in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| It's been there for 100-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| And so I think that's an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| People bought their properties, their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| We're surrounded by mom-and-pop businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| We're not necessarily surrounded by chains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| In fact, we asked why we couldn't get chains there from a commercial broker recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| and he said because we just can't attract that with the data on our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8029)|
| 2:13:55| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| That was a pretty tremendous discussion there, very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| There are two more people I do want to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| We recognized former Mayor Andy Tyree, but also there are two longtime residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| and former council members, longtime residents of this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| and former council members who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| Larry Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Larry, where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| Back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Thank you for being here, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| And Charlie Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| Thank you both for being here to show your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| So, Council, there is a motion and a second to approve 11P,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| which is the purchase and sale agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8079)|
| 2:14:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| So the motion passes 7-1, with 1 absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| 11Q is the resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| approving the St. Mary's Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| prepared by Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| for the former Tenova St. Mary's Hospital Campus bounded generally by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| East Churchwell Avenue to the north, St. Mary's Street to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| East Woodland Avenue to the south, and Huron Street to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| Motion to approve. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8110)|
| 2:15:17| The ayes have it and so ordered. So that is eight. Are you supporting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| I absolutely support the redevelopment. I think that's smart. That's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| best ones on there. Eight to zero. Passes eight to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| 11R is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| of Knoxville to negotiate and accept payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| from Metro Knoxville HMA LLC with respect to two parcels of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| located on Middlebrook Pike in the City of Knoxville, Tennessee and finding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| such payments are deemed to be in the furtherance of the public purposes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| the board as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| Move to approve. Second. Councilman Wallace. Yeah, well I'm not with you on this one. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| because I don't I think that was really smart to be in a redevelopment district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| that makes all the rest of this doable. You know this is and I get it that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| offsetting their purchase price and that's really what we're doing. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| offsetting the purchase price for Tenova site, now former Tenova site, for 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| million dollars to be financed. It's a 20-year TIF. Is that what we're piloting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| I'm sorry. Fifteen. Fifteen years. So we're financing, if you will, the way I look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| it, we're financing that 16 million over 15 years in a pilot and reduce taxes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| the development because this property does not need a pilot to be redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| This is not to enhance any redevelopment of, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| development of that property. In fact, as you went through the rezoning in recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| years, it's now set for a fairly high level of development with you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| and this pilot in fact will ensure the nature of the development which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8210)|
| 2:16:55| would be medical related and also will ensure the lesser intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8215)|
| 2:17:02| use of that property as well. So and how much do they have to, or do you know, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| you have an estimate of how much they're gonna invest in this property and can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| it be transferred or they're gonna have partners in it or you know what what do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| they intend to do with it? They will have to retain, they will have to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8236)|
| 2:17:21| in this actual development for health care. And this is sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| reverse of what's usual. If they invest a whole lot more and the value of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| pilot, that the taxes that are deferred exceed 16 million dollars, they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| not receive those benefits. In other words, we're limiting the benefit they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| can get to that to what would be the offset for the hospital purchase price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| as you mentioned. It's capped at that level. So if they happen to invest or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8262)|
| 2:17:47| they and a partner invest in a much higher intensity of medical use there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| and the taxes exceed what we projected here, those excess taxes would go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8271)|
| 2:17:56| city. So do you have an estimate of what you think those investments will total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| to? No. We have 15 years. Tony might want to speak to Tony Benton, but Tony can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8280)|
| 2:18:08| come forward. Well he's coming forward. I think it's important to note too, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| a large tract of property and so the capped pilot is on two parcels, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8291)|
| 2:18:17| pieces of property, not the entire property. So it's on two pieces of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| So additional development on the property could happen in the future. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| again, I think Councilman Roberto talked about the commitment by Tenova for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| Greenway connection through the site and they're working with our law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8310)|
| 2:18:34| right now on that. Mr. Benton. Mr. Benton, please state your name and address for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| the record. Thank you. Tony Benton, representing Tenova Healthcare. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| personal address, 9051 Hemingway Grove Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| Ms. Mayor, Council Members, thanks for the opportunity to be here. As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| specifically with our investment, the plans we have announced so far is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8332)|
| 2:18:58| Knoxville Rehabilitation Hospital construction property investment total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8338)|
| 2:19:04| of 30.5 million dollars. And we are again exploring other opportunities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8344)|
| 2:19:11| healthcare investments in that Middlebrook location. So will a 30 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8351)|
| 2:19:16| dollar investment equate to a 16 million dollar pilot in 15 years, Bill? I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| that's my question. So just to add, that's on one of the two parcels. Okay. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8360)|
| 2:19:27| That's on one. Well, the good news is if it doesn't add up to that, they won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| receive it. I mean, in other words, the pilot is a function of what the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| would be. Up to 16 million. Up to 16. If they invest a lesser amount than we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| would have figured, then the value of the pilot will be less than that. They won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| get the 16 million value. If they invest more, they're capped at 16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| Will they still be subject to third-party review like other pilots? No. This is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| third-party review. This isn't a but-for. I mean, this is an explicit request for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8393)|
| 2:19:57| project to occur as part of this arrangement. This is never come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8397)|
| 2:20:03| that this project could not happen but for the pilot. It's a different use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| the payment in lieu of taxes. Okay. And so the second parcel, would it also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| to be medical? Yes. It had to be done by them, right? They can't sell that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| property and transfer their pilot. That's right. They cannot sell this right to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| this pilot. If they sell it, there's no pilot for the... They can have partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| Yes, they can have partners. But as long as they're a partner, is that the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8423)|
| 2:20:28| you see it there? I mean, they can have partners, but as long as they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| a partner in it, then... Yes, partners at least at the outset. I mean, after it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8431)|
| 2:20:36| built, if they change, I don't think the city has any real concern there as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| long as it remains medical and operated as medical. Yes, that would be... The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| pilot would be contingent on that. But at the outset, they must be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| when this project happens. So I don't know. Maybe it's in here. Maybe I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| missed it. But so there's two parcels. So there's basically 60 acres in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| lower section and then, I don't know, roughly 40 acres in the back. So you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| talking about the 60 acres split and the 60 acres, is that what we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| about? I believe there's a diagram in the... Right. So there's, I believe, 102| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| total acres, 60 on the front. And as you... If you went across from Dow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8469)|
| 2:21:14| Springs and went in and went to the right, there are two parcels. And the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| of those parcels, Mr. Benton? Approximately 8 acres and 7 acres, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| believe. Thank you. Okay. All right. I don't know. Maybe I do. Okay. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| what I was wondering. But in essence, are you saying that you think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8488)|
| 2:21:36| value of the property at East Hill at Oak Hill Avenue equates to $16 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| And that's why we're getting the... I mean, how did you come up with $16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| million? How did you equate the two? We gave a lot of thought and we had a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| of negotiation with Mr. Benton and others. The property was on the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8508)|
| 2:21:53| rolls. We were pronouncing its value up until very recently at the, what, $59| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| million? $58 million. $58 something million. So that's what it was. You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| that as one benchmark. Another was it will cost approximately $16 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| I stand corrected by Mr. Benton if I'm wrong, for them to buy out of all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| REITs and untangle the financial arrangement they had. That is, they had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| $16 million, I think $12 plus has already appeared in property transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| last week, in order for them to get complete control of that property prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| to their transferring it to us. So the $16 million was a number we arrived at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| in pretty intense discussion with the folks at Tenova. Basically a negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| price given all those factors. Yeah, because the Baptist Hospital site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8556)|
| 2:22:42| once again, to drag up dead horses here, so, I mean, that would be a comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8562)|
| 2:22:47| I mean, it sold for much, much less than that. Now, you might have gotten much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| less than that, I don't know, but it was on the water, so you got more buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| over in Tenova or whatever, but I mean, it was certainly a comp. It was much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| much less than that. Yeah, I mean, we also looked at factors like the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| garage. There's a $700 plus space parking garage. If you built that $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| to $30,000, you're looking at $17.5 million in value for a garage. And so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| was a negotiated amount that was difficult to arrive at for both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8588)|
| 2:23:15| I think it was negotiated. They obviously probably thought they needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| more, and we thought they needed a little less, and we met right there in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| the middle. But it's really about their exit from the system, and I think $12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| million in buyouts really went through and was in the paper, the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| journal, excuse me, a couple of weeks ago. With one left to come, but one other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| factor, of course, we were very happy that with the time value of money, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| spreading that $16 million over 15 years. So, you know, this we think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8618)|
| 2:23:44| actually, I don't know, you could figure what the actual in today's dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8624)|
| 2:23:48| once you discount it, but it'd be substantially less than the $16. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| pursued this as a way for us to be able to get in without any further cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| outlay, ensure health care out in the Middlebrook area, and just help make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| this deal work for everybody in the most effective way that was. And it did, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| was quite extensive. We had a number of sessions of negotiating that when Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| Brace and I were out at St. Mary's in discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| Well, additional, like you said earlier, I mean, additional TIFs are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| or will be available on this property for future development. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| Did not include TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| Well, we, it's not in the redevelopment area, the Middlebrook, so there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| eligibility for a tax increment financing right now. It has to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| redevelopment, the development area, excuse me, for that. Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| something could happen that a future council could decide to grant to pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| but we have made no commitment to any other pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| I misspoke. I was really speaking of the Tenova site now. The current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| Tenova site will have additional TIFs on that property available, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| Well, I think we have to be, again, that's always in the toolbox. And given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| when the community involvement and how much that ends up being public space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| some of it may want to be a strong amount of pressure, just like pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| or desire like we had across at the Baptist Hospital site to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| space that's publicly owned that any private developer would expect some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| public participation in. But that will, again, be negotiated and up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| next administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| Thank you. Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| I'm having a hard time separating some of my feelings about this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| I'm very frustrated with Tenova for leaving that site. It was a place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| people were using those services. I also feel like the city is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8728)|
| 2:25:35| saving your butts on this. That's a site where when you leave, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| take a long time to resell. For that period of time, you would be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8741)|
| 2:25:45| property taxes on it. And that would be your burden to figure out. But I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8745)|
| 2:25:51| like the city's taking over and making it a much easier transition for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| And then on top of that, I understand the $12 million. That made sense that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| that's what's necessary. But I just don't... And then the site in West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8760)|
| 2:26:07| Hills, I know that you were already going to build there, but it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| but-for pilot. I just don't feel like rewarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8770)|
| 2:26:19| I appreciate the comments and certainly a difficult decision for Tenova to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| make. And there's a lot of detail behind that. But suffice it to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8784)|
| 2:26:31| the sustainability of Physicians Regional, I think, was in question for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| number of years. There was deteriorating finances over time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8795)|
| 2:26:40| made it more and more difficult to have a sustainable healthcare entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8800)|
| 2:26:46| there. Faced with some of the aging infrastructure, how healthcare is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8806)|
| 2:26:53| delivered, how people choose to get their healthcare and where they choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| that. As you've seen, a lot of services exit hospitals, go to physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| offices. A lot of that was particularly challenging for that hospital and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8822)|
| 2:27:08| that site there. And with that, coupled with a lot of challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8828)|
| 2:27:13| reimbursement rates in the area. But it was certainly multifactorial and very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8833)|
| 2:27:19| much a difficult decision. It's not something that was taken lightly by any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| stretch of the imagination. As far as the bailout, I would respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8844)|
| 2:27:29| disagree with that. I think the opportunity to have a win-win with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8849)|
| 2:27:34| project, that the City has a good use for it, for all the reasons that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8854)|
| 2:27:40| expressed here tonight, I think supports that. And the pilot is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8860)|
| 2:27:48| certainly a part of the repayment for that, but does allow us to reinvest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| the community. Tenova is committed to the services here. Our Turkey Creek Medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| Center site, our North Knoxville Medical Site, the opportunities that we see at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| that site, this we believe is a fair price and a fair compensation to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8884)|
| 2:28:13| to reinvest long-term into the community. Well, I think you're able to reinvest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8893)|
| 2:28:18| into the community without the pilot. I think for the property that is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8898)|
| 2:28:26| turned over, again the assessed value of $57.7 million for that property is again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8906)|
| 2:28:34| something that we talked about in length and believe that is fair for both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| parties involved. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Roberta. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| Mayor. Mr. Benton, there was a notice on March 17th for real estate transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8924)|
| 2:28:52| There were three different transfers that occurred, and I believe that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8932)|
| 2:28:58| we were talking about earlier. It looks like you were purchasing properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8938)|
| 2:29:04| maybe were on this site, the former St. Mary's site, to make sure that you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| do this transfer. Is that correct? Yes, sir, and this predates me from being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| here, but in the most implicit terms, that was basically a read that was done a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8954)|
| 2:29:20| number of years ago that was sold to a third party on the campus. We did have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8960)|
| 2:29:28| purchase that back in order to turn the property over to the city, unencumbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8968)|
| 2:29:33| Thank you, and just wanted to make a comment that I'm going to call on Donny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| Ernst, the president of West Hills Neighborhood Association, to come down and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| talk a little bit about that, but as he's coming down, just wanted to thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8983)|
| 2:29:47| reaching out to the neighborhood and having discussions with, I think, all the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8987)|
| 2:29:52| here about this particular property on Middlebrook, and I know Donny's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| get into that here in a second. Thank you. Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| Hello, Donny. Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| Okay. I'm Donny Ernst. I live at 6830 Sheffield, and I'm the president of West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9004)|
| 2:30:11| and I'm on the executive committee for Wesley Neighbors, which is in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| I really appreciate you guys, what you really do now, sitting back there and watching this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9015)|
| 2:30:20| so thank you for what you do, and also a little side note for your calendar that you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9020)|
| 2:30:26| earlier. We have our third annual dog walk on the same day as the conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| so come on out at nine o'clock if you want to. Okay, so we've met Tenova, walked the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9030)|
| 2:30:38| We really like the layout, what they're doing now. We've gone over it with a lot of neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9038)|
| 2:30:44| Everybody agrees with it, as long as they look over a couple of things with us. One was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9044)|
| 2:30:52| they were telling us that they were going to do the connecting greenway, which is the Jean Teague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| all the way over to Third Creek Greenway, so we'd really like some of this in writing. We're supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9056)|
| 2:31:02| to meet with them again May 20th at our general meeting, and then also they said that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9062)|
| 2:31:08| put a buffer between them and the neighborhood, so we're really wanting these things. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9068)|
| 2:31:15| keeping the Back Forty. Council Member Wallace mentioned that. The Back Forty is on the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9075)|
| 2:31:23| side of the creek to the south side, which is, I think it's zoned agricultural anyway right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9083)|
| 2:31:29| and we really like to keep that as is. Matter of fact, when we were walking the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9089)|
| 2:31:36| we ran into Bambi and the family, so we did see a family of deer, so that would be nice that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9096)|
| 2:31:43| had that to keep. And then to keep the light pollution down, and then also a retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9103)|
