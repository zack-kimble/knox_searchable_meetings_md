| 2:31:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| Obviously, Hardin Valley is our fastest-growing area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| in regard to residential building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| I don't know exactly where South Knoxville falls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| It is obviously much slower in growth than Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| Would you say it's nowhere close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| I would think that would be a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| I'll just make one comment here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| before I close our remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| I feel like we've got at least five to six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| current studies in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| We've got a constant team looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| We've got an area-wide county study on top of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9125)|
| 2:32:08| If this is a safety issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| I'd much rather see us spend $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| supporting our law enforcement to patrol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| and slow people down or to find guardrails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| and find our traffic and engineering teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| to help support some specific projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| I'm not sure I can see duplicating work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| in an area that is not as burgeoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| as some of our other areas of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9152)|
| 2:32:36| Thank you, Commissioner Jake. Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| I feel a little bit of the opposite of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| What I see here is the city is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| a plan or a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| and what that does is that feeds into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| So if they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| a study that's going to affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| their state routes and their feeder routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| it only makes sense for Knox County to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| looking at the same time that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| because what they do may determine what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| Their improvement suggestions may coincide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| with some of ours. It may be some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| where we can work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| The area in south Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| reminds me a lot of the northwest Knox area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9201)|
| 2:33:24| There's a lot of dangerous roads, narrow roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| no shoulders, deep ditch lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9207)|
| 2:33:30| drop-offs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| I think a good extensive look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9213)|
| 2:33:36| and I've been preaching it for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9216)|
| 2:33:39| we sit on our hands a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9219)|
| 2:33:42| We make studies that we're scared to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| for lack of a better term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| but we also sit on our hands a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| and wait for something to happen to become a hot topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| This is a thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| The state's working on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9237)|
| 2:34:00| and all the feeders around it, we should probably be looking at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| I agree that our traffic engineering guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| do a great job on the hot spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| but they don't know where all the hot spots are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| if they're not looking for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| because all they're doing pretty much is fielding our calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9255)|
| 2:34:18| We're reactionary in everything we do in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| and this is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9261)|
| 2:34:24| If you're hesitant about studying something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| because of what it costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| that's what delayed our fire study for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| because we're worried about what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| The folks in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| and I know the folks in South Knoxville and North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| and East and West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| we're beginning to tell them no on safety improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| We've been telling them no on safety improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| We've been telling them no on park improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| We tell them no on many things and they're really getting tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| I think it's important that we do things like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| to plan ahead and be ahead of the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| instead of sitting and waiting on something to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| That's why I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9307)|
| 2:35:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| Mr. Snowden, was this agreement run through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| Matt Meyer's procurement department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| No, it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| Being a professional service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9322)|
| 2:35:25| we don't necessarily bid those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| We can choose if we would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| what's called a request for qualification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9331)|
| 2:35:34| to establish the most qualified vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| We chose not to do that in this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| because CDM Smith has done all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| strategic planning documents in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| and they can really start the process much quicker and more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9346)|
| 2:35:49| We do that from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| in regard to when we do RFQs or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| based on the scope of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9355)|
| 2:35:58| and what vendor may have the best approach to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| The TPO and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| are doing the Hardin Valley Mobility Study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| which is involving transportation corridors and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| How come we wouldn't have asked them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| to do this same type of project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9376)|
| 2:36:19| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| In my staff, we have a couple of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9382)|
| 2:36:25| that we've reallocated resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| or I have since I've been the director there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9388)|
| 2:36:31| and we've got some people that have an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| in these studies that we feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| nothing against JF, they do a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| and they're more honed in on the engineering fundamentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| and I just think that with my staffing availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| we can do it and do a good job at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9406)|
| 2:36:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| I guess the other comment I have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| if the sitting commissioner for that district says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| don't spend the money, just the same as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| the vice chairman would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| don't spend $150,000 in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| I'm not going to lean to their expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| because they're the ones that are the boots on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| I agree with Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| that maybe this needs to be delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| until after we can find out if we're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9440)|
| 2:37:23| a countywide study done, but to just spend money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| and then to turn around and have a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9446)|
| 2:37:29| and spend more money again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9449)|
| 2:37:32| I just don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| I'd like to lean in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9455)|
| 2:37:38| There could be another way on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9458)|
| 2:37:41| Jim, I believe your words, or it may have been JF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| was that approximately with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| more locally focused survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| at any particular region, it might result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| in about two-thirds of additional data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9473)|
| 2:37:56| that would be above and beyond the scope of the countywide survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| that will be discussed at TPO Wednesday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| The option that could be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| would be if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| your countywide study done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9488)|
| 2:38:11| you could have that which provides more general data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| then with specific areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| in the county that receive additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| focus as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9500)|
| 2:38:23| So you could overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| with the countywide to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| corridor type of studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| with specific focuses so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| the duplication of measurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| that would have happened if you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| a corridor survey right before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9521)|
| 2:38:44| you end up doing a countywide survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| that could be potentially avoided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9530)|
| 2:38:53| Jim, is that something you could weigh in, or JF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| I'll let JF speak to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| I think that does shrink that two-thirds margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| I still think though that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| there is some things that you're not going to be able to gleam unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| this detailed study is done, but it certainly does shrink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9548)|
| 2:39:11| the margin of that two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| I don't know if JF has anything else to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| Do you have anything to add on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| with any study you could delve into the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9564)|
| 2:39:27| where particular corridors are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| and as Jim indicated, if there's four or five corridors in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| that you really want to delve into, then you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| write the scope of services for the consultants to bring in that type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| expertise to collect that type of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| Again, going back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| this commission asked the TPO to look at the North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| corridor study, and we as staff are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| at that and say, well, that should be a subset of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| countywide study because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| a lot of things feed into North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| It's just not North Shore Drive, so let's look at it at broad perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| but we're recommending that we fund additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| funds on this countywide study in conversation with Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| to support the North Shore Drive corridor study as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| overall study. So that is an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| that could be considered by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| But could that also, that model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| apply equally to the South Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| corridor, what we were just talking about, where you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9624)|
| 2:40:27| an additional, as I said, corridor survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9627)|
| 2:40:30| overlaid while we're doing the county level big picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| study? Is that something that could be done as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9633)|
| 2:40:36| for the South Knox? I believe so. It would be up to how comfortable Jim is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| because they would be managing that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| or we'd be jointly managing it with them, but yes, you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| potentially do that. Obviously, the more levels of details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| you go into, there's added costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| Thank you. Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| Who has not weighed in on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9654)|
| 2:40:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| Will this study collect data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9663)|
| 2:41:06| or will it tell us solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9666)|
| 2:41:09| and costs? It'll do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9669)|
| 2:41:12| Will it provide data that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| are unable to obtain right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| Will you find things that you don't expect or is this pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| going to tell us what we already know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| I think it'll do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| I think that we've never really dived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| into this level of detail in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9690)|
| 2:41:33| Typically, we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| hot spots, areas and sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| of roadway that have crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| This study will do that in addition to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| alternate corridors that may need to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| I think there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| some things like that that will be gleaned out of the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| that would be useful for us long term to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| that 25-30 years from now, the roadway network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| in South Knoxville supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| the capacity of the cars that are going to be traveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| in and out of the area. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| Yes, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| Mr. Chairman. Do we know how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| that North Shore corridor study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| is costing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| I don't believe so. I don't think we ever got any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| specific estimate on that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker just said at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| $100,000 or so. I would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| to do that level of study, it would most likely be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| in that neighborhood. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| It was also mentioned that we might wait on grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9762)|
| 2:42:45| that could be eight months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| Is there a 100% guarantee that we are going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| those grants or is it just a waiting seat like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| grants are? We don't know or do we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9774)|
| 2:42:57| if it will be awarded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| Correct me if I'm wrong, I believe the TPO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| exec board will meet this week and actually vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| The TPO executive board, which consists of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| county mayor and Hughes on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| that decision will be made locally. It's not dependent on TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| or federal government or anything, but we'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9798)|
| 2:43:21| the final recommendation here later this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| and again, staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| has a preliminary recommendation that we're going to share with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| the TPO board tomorrow. What we think we can afford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| we got $20 million more requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| than we had funding available, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| we've eliminated a number of projects, but this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| is still in there at a set amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| and depending how the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| wants to work or how Jim wants to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9828)|
| 2:43:51| or not include a more detailed analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9831)|
| 2:43:54| the funding may have to be increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| on the federal share bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| It's like what Commissioner Anders said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| he's right. The people are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| getting tired of just the same old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| same old and waiting for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| to happen and then everybody starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9852)|
| 2:44:15| jumping. Living here all my life, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9855)|
| 2:44:18| what John Sevier, I know what Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| I know what South Knoxville. I would go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9861)|
| 2:44:24| every single Tuesday while my mother bowled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| at Palace Lanes from the time I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| I guess from a newborn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| Speaking in my district with Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| Washington Pike, Millartown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9876)|
| 2:44:39| it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| People are, I thought South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9882)|
| 2:44:45| is building up, people are wanting to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| Here we were just a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9888)|
| 2:44:51| talking about getting a BMX track out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| and how it was going to bring so many people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| into the South Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9897)|
| 2:45:04| We've had these studies done in every other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| area of town, essentially but South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9907)|
| 2:45:10| and North area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9910)|
| 2:45:13| It's time that we as county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| be proactive and get started on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9916)|
| 2:45:19| instead of waiting until the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| and we don't have infrastructure that supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9922)|
| 2:45:25| businesses or whatever we need because we're all up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| saying that we're all for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| and we're all for moving Knox County forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9931)|
| 2:45:34| and it's going to take everybody's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| to make it the best Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9937)|
| 2:45:40| place to live. I applaud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| Commissioner Biggs because he was proactive on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| and he has gotten involved because we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| issue after issue in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| this past year. So South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| is getting a lot of attention right now and as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| I would be excited that I'm getting a lot of attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| and if somebody wanted to do something that was going to make my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9961)|
| 2:46:04| better, I'd be all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| Thank you Commissioner Carringer. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| Thank you Mr. Chairman. I needed to ask a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9970)|
| 2:46:13| Are the roads we're interested in studying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9973)|
| 2:46:16| match what the city is doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9976)|
| 2:46:22| I'm not sure if I totally understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9982)|
| 2:46:25| The city is involved in looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| some of the Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| so are the roads in this study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| alternative roads that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| match or feed into what the city is doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9997)|
| 2:46:40| Because I lived in South Knoxville, Vestal, 12 and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10000)|
| 2:46:43| so I can appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10003)|
| 2:46:46| no shoulder, no sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| and just very steep ditches, very narrow roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| but I want to know do these roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10012)|
| 2:46:55| affect one, issues of safety, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| that are around our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| The railroad is not going to allow us to widen any of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10021)|
| 2:47:04| or tear those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10024)|
| 2:47:07| What we would like to study, does it impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| or parallel even what the city is looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| that will feed into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10033)|
| 2:47:16| Yes ma'am. Most of the roads we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10036)|
| 2:47:19| are the main arterials in and out of South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| Some of those, as Commissioner Daley said, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10042)|
| 2:47:25| they're part in the city, part in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| so yes, there would be some overlap there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10048)|
| 2:47:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10051)|
| 2:47:37| Mr. Welch, you had said that the TPO would probably vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| in August, did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| Probably August is our estimated time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| We'll put in our package together and then be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| reviewed by local governments and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10072)|
| 2:47:55| get the whole document together so it will be August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10075)|
| 2:47:58| that we're shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| At that time we'll know what that study will entail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10081)|
| 2:48:04| At that time you will know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| are we going to allocate $400,000 or $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| for the study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| Do we want to combine it with a more detailed north shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| Does the commission desire to add additional details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| if we can come up with additional federal funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| Remember that the county has to come up with local funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| Right now we're looking at $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| give or take to $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| so the county would be looking at $100,000 to $125,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| as a match to this county wide study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| and if you go into the details that does include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| north shore corridor too, Mr. Shoemaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| It might benefit us to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10123)|
| 2:48:46| and include this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10126)|
| 2:48:49| as additional detail into that study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| like we are north shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10133)|
| 2:48:56| That is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| The question has been posed to that that you could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| defer this vote until we find out what TPO is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10148)|
| 2:49:14| A substitute motion has been made by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| with a second by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10157)|
| 2:49:21| Mr. Chairman, may I make one statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| That's all I'm asking is a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10164)|
| 2:49:27| We've got so many studies going on in South Knoxville now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10167)|
| 2:49:30| let's take all that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| let's wait until we get our county mobility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| take all that data and then I will go with Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| and we will do a resolution to study this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| and it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| to delay until we find this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10185)|
| 2:49:48| and if it does not pass TPO for some reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| then we'll go back and we'll do this $148,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10191)|
| 2:49:57| The motion before us, we have additional discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10197)|
| 2:50:00| Mr. Law Director, when do we need to proceed to a vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10200)|
| 2:50:08| The discussion has to be on the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| That's what we're now discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10214)|
| 2:50:18| Earlier, is that something you wish to weigh in on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10218)|
| 2:50:21| I'm glad we decided to delay a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10221)|
| 2:50:25| Mr. Snowden, how long would it take once we do the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10225)|
| 2:50:28| if it came back that there was something needed to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| when would it be started on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10231)|
| 2:50:34| Would you say five, ten years? What would it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10234)|
| 2:50:37| You mean to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| if a project was identified in a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10240)|
| 2:50:43| how long it would take for us to get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10243)|
| 2:50:46| If it was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10246)|
| 2:50:49| we would probably have the study complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| by the end of this calendar year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10252)|
| 2:50:55| so it's possible that you could see a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| ask for the capital budget for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| so within two to three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| it's possible that this study could garner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10264)|
| 2:51:07| some sort of smaller type improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| You would also have to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| acquisition of land and things of that sort, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10274)|
| 2:51:17| Correct, sir. We usually ask this body to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| an appropriation for engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| one fiscal year, land acquisition the next fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10283)|
| 2:51:26| and then construction the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| I think I know why the city is doing a study on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| because I think they stopped the James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| and didn't let it go on to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| So I think it's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| that we delay this until we find out exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| what's going to be happening in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| Good motion, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10308)|
| 2:51:51| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10311)|
| 2:51:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Snowden, I just want to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| Did I hear you correctly when you said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| you've identified several members of your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| and you could do this study internally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| We could support the consultant's efforts internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| not necessarily do the study ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| I thought I heard that and I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| I may have misspoke, but that was not my intent, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| I was just going to say I support what Commissioner Daley said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| I can get behind that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10344)|
| 2:52:27| But I do want to make sure that we look at the scope of work that's going to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| in the south Knoxville area, in the south Knox County area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10350)|
| 2:52:33| and make sure that it dives into these specific areas with TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| Is that possible to do before or is that something...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10356)|
| 2:52:39| I think what I might weigh in on, Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10359)|
| 2:52:42| is it goes back to a point that both Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10362)|
| 2:52:45| and I brought up earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10365)|
| 2:52:48| We want to get some really clear for all of us definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| of what the different corridor surveys mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| what different regional surveys mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| We've got apples and turnips so that we can tell the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| and know exactly what we're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10380)|
| 2:53:03| I think that lesson from TPO and Jim's team would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| to this body moving forward so that when we get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| we'll be able to know exactly what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10389)|
| 2:53:12| So I guess I'm supporting what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| but to help us make informed decisions, I still couldn't tell the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| I've learned more in the last discussion about what the difference is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| between a corridor study and a regional study and this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| than I knew coming into this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| Because I feel like, and I might be wrong, you all might not get them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| I'd say Commissioner Jay gets them, but we get a lot of the copy and paste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| emails about BMX, ancient lore, Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10413)|
| 2:53:37| where one person will send one email and then 50 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10417)|
| 2:53:40| will send the exact same email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10420)|
| 2:53:43| And that is South Knox County, the past four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| like Commissioner Carringer said, it has been a hot-button issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10426)|
| 2:53:49| and I don't want to look for infrastructure needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| further down the road, kind of like Hardin Valley's doing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| which is a condition they would have four-laned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10435)|
| 2:53:58| If we could get in front and not put the cart before the horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| I believe it's going to be beneficial to South Knox County altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10441)|
| 2:54:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10444)|
| 2:54:07| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10447)|
| 2:54:10| Yeah, hey, Jeff, or I guess Jeff Welch with the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10450)|
| 2:54:13| I mean, I get the delay and I get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10453)|
| 2:54:16| but the TPO is designed, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10456)|
| 2:54:19| it's purposely designed to run very slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10459)|
| 2:54:23| It seems to be purposely designed to run very slow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| because there's so many, the region's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10466)|
| 2:54:29| There's a lot of votes to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10469)|
| 2:54:32| There's a lot of people that sit in that room and they have to push their interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| and that's the way it's designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10475)|
| 2:54:38| So if you voted in August to set aside the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| for the Knox County General Traffic Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| when does that go out to bid and when does that start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| The money would be available probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10487)|
| 2:54:51| the 1st of January of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| Once, you know, our approval would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| you know, at that time I think Knox County could begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| to develop the request for qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| or request for proposal to scope out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10504)|
| 2:55:07| what level of activity wanted to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| if there's any sub-area analysis that needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10510)|
| 2:55:13| and whatever that would meet the budget or at least estimated budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| So there would be that time where once we had the TPO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10516)|
| 2:55:19| and the TPO Executive Board approves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10519)|
| 2:55:22| that work could be done by county staff to develop the scope of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| and even begin to solicit for consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| So if a Hardin Valley Mobility Study is taking 14 to 16 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| from that date of beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10531)|
| 2:55:34| what does a Knox County Road Plan Study take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10534)|
| 2:55:37| that doesn't have any corridor stuff in it approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10537)|
| 2:55:40| It's a huge area obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| Your biggest key issue is going to be, as we've learned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10543)|
| 2:55:46| is the level of community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10546)|
| 2:55:49| That is really going to be a key issue of where are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10549)|
| 2:55:52| and how much community involvement you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| or is it all going to be just technical data come back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| and say here's all the technical analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| And I'm assuming that you'll want to have community involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10561)|
| 2:56:04| some more concentrated in areas maybe of North Shore or South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10564)|
| 2:56:07| than you might in another area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10567)|
| 2:56:10| So I think that is really going to drive the time frame, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| So if a district is taking you 14 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10573)|
| 2:56:16| what's nine districts going to take you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10576)|
| 2:56:19| And so I get the thought process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10579)|
| 2:56:22| but you're not going to study anything in South Knoxville for two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10582)|
| 2:56:25| That's essentially what you're saying right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| And I think you could accelerate various sections of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10588)|
| 2:56:31| say, okay, our priorities are going to be A, B, or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10591)|
| 2:56:34| General studies will help lead that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10594)|
| 2:56:37| but then we're going to hone in on the operational and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| and congestion of these two or three areas and accelerate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10600)|
| 2:56:43| Right, but you're still one-third of a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10603)|
| 2:56:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| I mean, you're still 14 months out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10609)|
| 2:56:52| and so you're 14 months out from January 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| You're not talking about anything in the budget until 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| I mean, that's what we're kicking the can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10618)|
| 2:57:01| I mean, I get it, but we're kicking the can down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| when you could be working on a certain area that is seeing growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| dangerous roadways, and is not going to do anything but get bigger and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10627)|
| 2:57:13| If that's what the commission chooses, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10633)|
| 2:57:16| but you're in the 2023, 2024, 2025 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10636)|
| 2:57:19| before you even have a discussion about what your project list is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10639)|
| 2:57:26| Okay, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| And Brad pretty much asked my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10649)|
| 2:57:32| that I really was wanting to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| If we put this off and wait to find out about the TPO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10656)|
| 2:57:41| then how far behind does that set us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10661)|
| 2:57:44| in terms of if we moved on with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10664)|
| 2:57:48| that's before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| the difference, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10671)|
| 2:57:54| He's talking about it would be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| in terms of us waiting anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| So it's something we can get done faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10680)|
| 2:58:05| and more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10685)|
| 2:58:11| I'm sorry to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| I mean, could you start this in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| if there is a different decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| Well, I'm not an expert on starting a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| but I would think that we could probably, with the technical data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| would be fairly easy with some of the community involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| from what I'm hearing from Jeff, that can take a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| But we could probably get it passed in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| and try to begin in September, October as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| Your money is not available until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| Well, I wonder if you could spend a match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10724)|
| 2:58:47| I mean, my point is there is a match involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10727)|
| 2:58:50| and if it gets approved at TPO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| I wonder if you could spend the match for the county monies first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10733)|
| 2:58:56| No, I guess my question was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| if there is a different decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| and for some reason that did not go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| this proposal could be started in September separate of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| I mean, if that didn't happen or it wasn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10748)|
| 2:59:11| You could fund this with county-level dollars exclusively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| rather than using the Fed monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| And I think one thing I want to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| Commissioner Carringer had asked a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| if it was like a grant that we're applying to get new money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| that's exactly how some of it's going to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| Is that clear, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| I mean, we're not talking about sending in a brand-new federal application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| to the Federal Department of Highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| There is some money that we're going to receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| This is more trying to figure out exactly how that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| that we're going to be receiving is allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| and that's what happens at TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| So, anyhow, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| If it's not there, this body can appropriate additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| to supplement any funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| that we could probably raise a match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10799)|
| 3:00:05| above and beyond what has been originally proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| So that would be up to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10808)|
| 3:00:11| which I think we'd be receptive to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| I am going to use a little bit of Chairman's discretion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| When we finish this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| I propose that we take a 10-minute break after this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| So, moving on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| Commissioner Daley, then Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10826)|
| 3:00:29| I'll finish by saying that I agree 100% with Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10829)|
| 3:00:35| Between now and August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| we need to sit down, Commissioner Biggs and I can sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=10838)|

| 3:08:13| and some of these other tournaments going along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11293)|
| 3:08:16| and Paul, I really do thank you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11296)|
| 3:08:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11299)|
| 3:08:22| Is there anything you want to say, Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| I really have enjoyedóMark Brown left earlieró| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| but really have enjoyed working with the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11308)|
| 3:08:31| I feel like we are making a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| and one of the big things we've done that you alluded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| is just the number of middle and high school programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11317)|
| 3:08:40| that a lot of the kids couldn't play anywhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| so we've helped the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| We're just trying to be a good neighbor, so I appreciate the opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11329)|
| 3:08:52| The sheriff's department inmates out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11332)|
| 3:08:55| they work on the golf course to help defray costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11335)|
| 3:08:59| and it saves the taxpayers of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11339)|
| 3:09:04| because when they work one day, they get credit for two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11344)|
| 3:09:07| so they're out quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11347)|
| 3:09:10| And so that saves about $100 or so a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11350)|
| 3:09:13| per inmate that works out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| and it does give them an education to do some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11355)|
| 3:09:18| In fact, we've had a couple that was out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| that started their own business when they got out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11361)|
| 3:09:27| but it's a mowing business, but they got into the mowing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| so it does help them start another life when they get out of the jail service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11370)|
| 3:09:34| That's good rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11374)|
| 3:09:36| Mr. White, is there any additional insight you've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11379)|
| 3:09:40| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11380)|
| 3:09:41| Stick around, we'll get to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| and try to wrap up tonight's discussion as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11385)|
| 3:09:48| I've had a hard time talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11388)|
| 3:09:54| or just thinking through the Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11394)|
| 3:09:56| I know Commissioner Busser and I have disagreed on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11396)|
| 3:09:59| what is the essential role of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11399)|
| 3:10:02| and should we be in the golf cart business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11402)|
| 3:10:04| I got the same report because I asked for some numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| as it related to this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| and wondered, you know, why we were spending that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| I think that if you look at all of the same report that you just read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11411)|
| 3:10:16| all the things that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11416)|
| 3:10:18| it does provide a good public service for a lot of our schools and our non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11418)|
| 3:10:23| But we should just call it that and call it an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| This is not a money-making venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| This is a public infrastructure, just like any other park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11428)|
| 3:10:32| I mean, we're, you know, in the past we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11432)|
| 3:10:35| I know Commissioner Busser said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| you know, it brings in all this money and all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| If a private sector, you know, golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11439)|
| 3:10:42| any number of them around the county would do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| But this particular golf course, over the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| has lost well over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11449)|
| 3:10:51| And I think that, yeah, it probably provides a great service for a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11451)|
| 3:10:56| We have to decide, is that something we want to fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11456)|
| 3:10:58| And if that's the case, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11458)|
| 3:11:00| It's part of our Parks and Rec's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11460)|
| 3:11:02| and if we feel like it's a great asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| But I do think at some point, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11464)|
| 3:11:06| it can't be a lost leader every single year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| to continue to put more and more and more money into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11469)|
| 3:11:13| unless we, that is specifically like every other Parks and Rec's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| where we just say we're going to allocate a certain amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11476)|
| 3:11:18| So I do see a lot of the benefit to our nonprofits and other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11478)|
| 3:11:22| but I definitely, you know, I just wanted to know that this is an operating loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11482)|
| 3:11:26| every single year to us from the operating standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11486)|
| 3:11:30| And I don't know if there's an opportunity to raise, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| a little bit of fees or find some outside investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| or a private-public partnership that we could keep the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| Just thought I'd add that to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11501)|
| 3:11:42| Thank you, Commissioner Bessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11504)|
| 3:11:46| Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11506)|
| 3:11:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11507)|
| 3:11:48| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11508)|
| 3:11:49| It's a long night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11509)|
| 3:11:50| That's all right, honey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11510)|
| 3:11:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11511)|
| 3:11:52| I also serve on Three Ridges Golf Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11512)|
| 3:11:56| and very honored to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11516)|
| 3:12:00| there's a lot of background with that property up there, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11520)|
| 3:12:07| The county years and years and years ago did a transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| kind of swapping out Hillcrest there on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11531)|
| 3:12:17| Hillcrest used to be up there where the workhouse and all that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11537)|
| 3:12:22| And when they did some of this swapping and made that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11542)|
| 3:12:26| they made a commitment to the people in the 8th District up there and around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11546)|
| 3:12:32| that that would remain a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| And so this has been a question that's been brought up through the years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11556)|
| 3:12:42| There was a commitment to the people out there that that property would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11562)|
| 3:12:48| It was a private golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| and we all know there are very, I mean, there's very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11570)|
| 3:12:55| there's not that many private golf courses that are making way above their money right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11575)|
| 3:13:02| And Three Ridges has been known now to have been brought up to the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11582)|
| 3:13:10| where our area high schools and middle schools that have golf teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11590)|
| 3:13:16| they don't have golf courses to go play on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11596)|
| 3:13:21| And there's Halls, Gibbs, I believe Central that go and play golf with their teams up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11601)|
| 3:13:30| and they're never charged a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| So it's providing for our Knox County schools also in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11612)|
| 3:13:39| I mean, because all these high schools have football fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11619)|
| 3:13:42| or they have a baseball field or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11622)|
| 3:13:46| But in terms of what we do at the property, how much investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11626)|
| 3:13:52| it has been a complete turnaround for all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11632)|
| 3:13:57| and there's people that come from all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| And it's one of, I think, one of the greatest things about Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11639)|
| 3:14:04| and something to be really proud of is that golf course up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11644)|
| 3:14:08| It's ran well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| You have a lot of seniors that come up there and volunteer and work on the courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11651)|
| 3:14:17| But the best thing, I mean, also is we have the prisoners there that come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11657)|
| 3:14:22| and they work each day on that, and they get two for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11662)|
| 3:14:26| So it is a great asset for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11666)|
| 3:14:30| It is well worth what goes into it and all of our non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11670)|
| 3:14:38| that the county took less money from through the years for our non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11678)|
| 3:14:43| are able to have golf tournaments out there to make extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| So it's a win-win for Knox County and the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11687)|
| 3:14:52| and for our students and all that use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11695)|
| 3:14:56| Commissioner Bussler, final comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11696)|
| 3:14:59| If Knox County's in the business to make money, then we'd all be out of a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11699)|
| 3:15:05| because we don't make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11705)|
| 3:15:08| We take in and we try to support the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11708)|
| 3:15:12| Concord Park, Beverly Park, we raise money at a local amateur tournament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11712)|
| 3:15:19| that we have out there, $7,000 to $8,000 a year where kids play free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11719)|
| 3:15:25| There's a lot of other things out there that it does that's a benefit for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11725)|
| 3:15:30| and it is a beautiful place out there, and it's run well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11730)|
| 3:15:34| and, you know, if Oak Ridge, which is a progressive, supposed to be a progressive town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11734)|
| 3:15:40| spent over a million dollars on their golf course to get it back in shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11740)|
| 3:15:44| after a private company ran it into the ground, which looks like, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11744)|
| 3:15:50| we've got something we can be proud of that we can have people go out there and enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11750)|
| 3:15:56| and keep our promise to the people out there that we're going to keep it as a golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11756)|
| 3:16:02| and keep it viable and keep it nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| and the only way we can do that is operate through our parks and recs like we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| and I thank Paul for all he does for us and what he helps us to keep that golf course up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11770)|
| 3:16:16| So that's my point about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11776)|
| 3:16:19| If you think they would give the same thing to our citizens that paid their tax dollars for that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11779)|
| 3:16:28| that they're getting right now from it from a private sector, that ain't going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11788)|
| 3:16:32| They're going to take the profits and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11795)|
| 3:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11796)|
| 3:16:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11797)|
| 3:16:38| I think that concludes our discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11798)|
| 3:16:40| Madam Clerk, what's the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11800)|
| 3:16:42| Item number 49, Resolution 907, is authorizing the execution of a waiver of an option to repurchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11802)|
| 3:16:50| and the waiver of certain restrictions applicable to property located in the Forks of the River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11810)|
| 3:16:57| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11817)|
| 3:16:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11818)|
| 3:16:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11819)|
| 3:17:00| We had a motion to approve by Commissioner Anders, and I think I heard a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11820)|
| 3:17:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11824)|
| 3:17:05| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11825)|
| 3:17:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11826)|
| 3:17:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11827)|
| 3:17:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11828)|
| 3:17:09| I pulled this off the item, off the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11829)|
| 3:17:12| I wanted to make sure and check with the law director that this is addressing an issue that creates a title problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11832)|
| 3:17:18| on these properties where these options to repurchase have long expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11838)|
| 3:17:23| and it applies to no other property than those that have already actually expired in Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11843)|
| 3:17:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11849)|
| 3:17:30| Generally, when they first created the Forks of the River Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| they were wholesaling or cheap selling these lots to get industry in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11853)|
| 3:17:39| and to prevent speculators from buying those lots and then making a windfall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11859)|
| 3:17:44| they had a repurchase agreement in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11864)|
| 3:17:47| Most of this property, and especially this one under question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11867)|
| 3:17:52| has already been purchased and already been developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11872)|
| 3:17:55| so the repurchase agreement really doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11875)|
| 3:17:59| But they want to make sure for clean title and this type of thing that you all waive certain restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11879)|
| 3:18:04| and that's what this is about because they're fixing to do a major investment in this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11884)|
| 3:18:10| and they want to make sure that they're not subject to the county coming and getting it for 50 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11890)|
| 3:18:17| That's basically the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11897)|
| 3:18:18| I might weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11898)|
| 3:18:19| I spoke with Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11899)|
| 3:18:20| Todd is out of town this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11900)|
| 3:18:22| Otherwise, he'd be here to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| Bottom line is this is to make sure the titles are clear to make it easier on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11904)|
| 3:18:27| It was a potential issue, especially considering the age of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11907)|
| 3:18:32| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=11914)|

| 3:21:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| You all were given a copy of a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| This is what you saw in our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12079)|
| 3:21:23| It is just updated and I apologize for the typo at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12083)|
| 3:21:26| That should be May 20th, not April 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12086)|
| 3:21:30| Just a quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12090)|
| 3:21:31| Thank you again for everybody's engagement on this retreat planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12091)|
| 3:21:36| We've moved forward quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| The schedule has been locked in for Friday, July 26th and Saturday, July 27th from 8 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12098)|
| 3:21:45| Location is at the Johnson University Arc Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12105)|
| 3:21:49| They are donating that facility for use pro bono, which is nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12109)|
| 3:21:54| It's literally going to be brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| We'll be one of the first few people, but there are some great meeting rooms in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12116)|
| 3:22:00| and they're going to host us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12120)|
| 3:22:02| Our facilitator for the retreat will be Jerry Askew and the Alliance for Better Nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12122)|
| 3:22:08| They are working through a proposal to us that we will contract with them for the entire project there, $4,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12128)|
| 3:22:17| That will include the facilitation materials, meals, snacks, and a comprehensive summary report for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12137)|
| 3:22:23| The reason that we are not getting any kind of meals or refreshments from Johnson University is that summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12143)|
| 3:22:30| during that particular weekend, their whole food service program is off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12150)|
| 3:22:33| So ABN said that they would take care of that and coordinate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12153)|
| 3:22:37| I've provided just a draft agenda for everybody's review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12157)|
| 3:22:41| You can certainly send that back via forum or comment on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12161)|
| 3:22:46| One of the things I just wanted to really point out in that is I felt like with our strategic planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12166)|
| 3:22:51| it's important for us to make sure that we have the major stakeholders also included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12171)|
| 3:22:59| I essentially basically looked at our top three budget items and our county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12179)|
| 3:23:05| and thought that it would be really crucial for us to make sure we knew what their visions were for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12185)|
| 3:23:11| so that we can incorporate those into our strategic planning and what our vision would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12191)|
| 3:23:14| So we're all on the same page, hopefully, coming out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12194)|
| 3:23:17| As you'll see in the agenda, we essentially used the beginning of the first day to welcome Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12197)|
| 3:23:25| Sheriff Spangler and his team, Superintendent Thomas and his team, and Director Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12205)|
| 3:23:30| to give a very, very short vision for what it is that they are looking out ahead of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12210)|
| 3:23:38| and their strategic planning and visioning so that we can incorporate those into our processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12218)|
| 3:23:45| You'll also see on the end of the first day, this is something I'd just love a little bit of feedback on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12225)|
| 3:23:52| I left a block of time for some potential CTAS training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12232)|
| 3:23:57| In the original survey that I sent out, there were several questions about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12237)|
| 3:24:02| would you like more information or a deep dive on other topics that we might bring in an outside expert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12242)|
| 3:24:09| As you know, CTAS can often provide us somebody either within their organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12249)|
| 3:24:14| or one degree of separation thereafter that might be a subject matter expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12254)|
| 3:24:19| Some of the feedback and some of the interests of topics that people put into that survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12259)|
| 3:24:23| were things like, I'd like to know more about home rule and charter government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12263)|
| 3:24:28| or I'd like to know more about our government structure and checks and balances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12268)|
| 3:24:33| and I'd like to know more about sunshine laws or debt and finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12273)|
| 3:24:38| So I'm looking for some commission suggestions to be able to contact CTAS of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12278)|
| 3:24:44| is there a particular topic or two that you would really, really like to hear a subject matter expert come in and hear more on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12284)|
| 3:24:55| That's the only thing I'm asking tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| Other than that, we'll set the agenda and get feedback from you in June, get the contract in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12298)|
| 3:25:04| and in July we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| So I'm open to answer any questions about where we are in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| but I sure would love some feedback on that particular topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12310)|
| 3:25:14| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| Larson, this was a great job on this, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12316)|
| 3:25:18| Are you going to be in Gatlinburg any of the next couple days at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12318)|
| 3:25:22| I have some work obligations that prevent me from going to that conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12322)|
| 3:25:25| Okay, because all the CTAS staff will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12325)|
| 3:25:29| So if you don't mind, I'll just ask them what are some of their most popular subjects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12329)|
| 3:25:34| that they have their own in-house people, if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12334)|
| 3:25:37| I mean, that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| You've got a great relationship with them, so I would ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12339)|
| 3:25:42| Unless we come out of tonight with a, I really would love to know more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| but, yes, I think any time we can get outside continuing education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12345)|
| 3:25:49| at the same time that it ties into our strategic planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12349)|
| 3:25:53| maybe it is about how to county strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12355)|
| 3:26:00| One thing on that note, I think CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12360)|
| 3:26:04| they've got experts on just about every single subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12364)|
| 3:26:08| That's been my experience, and I'll be up there tomorrow for most of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12368)|
| 3:26:14| Charter rule, I guess some things, what are we really going to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12374)|
| 3:26:17| because we can talk about charter rule and how this came to be alive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12377)|
| 3:26:21| but it's really not going to change how we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12381)|
| 3:26:25| I don't have an answer just yet on any additions that we might want to put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12385)|
| 3:26:35| You know, one thing on here, and it's timely because we were talking about budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12395)|
| 3:26:41| and I think before this meeting, Commissioner Jay, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| he showed we had a budget flow chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12403)|
| 3:26:46| You know, a big part of what we do is discuss about money, and we've got the priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12406)|
| 3:26:50| It might be of interest to have a little bit more discussion about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12410)|
| 3:26:56| the flow and process of the budget might be a pretty relevant discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12416)|
| 3:27:04| Okay, any other ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12424)|
| 3:27:06| Anybody interested in any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12426)|
| 3:27:14| I was thinking, you know, all this growth and development and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12434)|
| 3:27:18| I think we just had a meeting today talking about some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12438)|
| 3:27:23| I think that's something the sector plans, the zonings and all about what's going on with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12443)|
| 3:27:33| doing the recode and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| On top of that, I remember we had a prior meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| I can't remember if it was March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12458)|
| 3:27:40| I know that there was some lack of clarity in Nashville about some of the votes maybe around sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12460)|
| 3:27:47| and the growth plans, and, you know, we did our step of, you know, convening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12467)|
| 3:27:51| getting the meetings convened, but we still weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| I think where we left it, not think, I know where we left it as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12473)|
| 3:27:57| that we would revisit this in July probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12477)|
| 3:28:00| and we'll put that out as an agenda item around planning and the growth plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12480)|
| 3:28:04| and or sector plans to discuss and see where we are in the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12484)|
| 3:28:09| However, that could be something that could carry over into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12489)|
| 3:28:14| But, frankly, now that I say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| we don't know exactly what the final outcome is going to be out of the coordinating committee too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12496)|
| 3:28:21| But I know that's something we're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| A lot of that feeds directly into the budget discussions that we're having tonight around roads and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12503)|
| 3:28:27| I know that part of that discussion was understanding the layers of what supersedes what and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12507)|
| 3:28:33| and what's done on a federal level versus state level versus local level versus a neighborhood level versus a subset of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12513)|
| 3:28:41| One thing I might add, I think the planning commission sent a note out, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12521)|
| 3:28:44| we've recently created a, by the way, get y'all's black binders, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12524)|
| 3:28:48| They're still in the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12528)|
| 3:28:49| They at least printed the growth plans and sector plans, and they're up in the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12529)|
| 3:28:53| which might be a good reference document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| But the planning commission at my direction recently updated their website, and they've got a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12535)|
| 3:29:01| I remember Scott Davis at a meeting here a while back talking about all of these different growth plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12541)|
| 3:29:05| and we've consolidated them all into one stop shop on the planning commission website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12545)|
| 3:29:10| which can make it a little bit easier to get to some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| But go ahead, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12552)|
| 3:29:14| Well, if we can't find a, you know, we kind of put on the back burner that fire and emergency services study from CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12554)|
| 3:29:23| and if we can't find anybody from CTAS to come, I'll be more than welcome to ask Kevin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12563)|
| 3:29:28| because we've really got to figure out what we're going to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12568)|
| 3:29:30| We can't just let that sit, and it's not, you know, what we do is not sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12570)|
| 3:29:35| You know, South Knoxville's, you know, Seymour Volunteers, all dependent on volunteer fire departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12575)|
| 3:29:42| and it's a very big struggle to get people to volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12582)|
| 3:29:46| I mean, we all mostly have two income families and not a lot of downtime for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12586)|
| 3:29:53| So to put our residents at risk at times, and I don't know what Seymour's deployment is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12593)|
| 3:29:59| but we've got a lot of things, you know, the rescue squad came and wanted double funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12599)|
| 3:30:05| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12605)|
| 3:30:06| Do we open a new county department, or do we, I mean, because that's essentially what that funding would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12606)|
| 3:30:12| is fund a self, you know, and really there's discussions with the state of Tennessee about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12612)|
| 3:30:21| the fire chiefs have the jurisdiction on any kind of rec scene as far as rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12621)|
| 3:30:27| and so, I mean, there's no MOUs in place currently for those agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12627)|
| 3:30:32| and so there's a lot of things that we need to work through over the next 9 to 12 months in emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12632)|
| 3:30:38| and if there's room and you all want to talk about that in the retreat, I'd love to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12638)|
| 3:30:44| Okay. I think Billy noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| Yeah, I'll add that to the list, and then, John, maybe we can have just a quick recap of this list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12646)|
| 3:30:52| so when you go up there for the next couple of days, and then ultimately what I'll do is come back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12652)|
| 3:30:57| based on the feedback I get from that and looking at the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12657)|
| 3:31:00| I'll come back in June with a final agenda to propose to this commission to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12660)|
| 3:31:05| here's what we're going to do and set forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12665)|
| 3:31:07| and then that way everybody has their marching orders a good 30 days in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12667)|
| 3:31:10| especially for our stakeholders who are asking to come present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12670)|
| 3:31:14| Very good. Sound good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12674)|
| 3:31:15| Sounds good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12675)|
| 3:31:17| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12677)|
| 3:31:22| The scheduling of BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12682)|
| 3:31:24| Okay. BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12684)|
| 3:31:26| This body discussed back at the March meeting a desire to revisit the BMX discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12686)|
| 3:31:32| I sent out a questionnaire to everybody, and we got over 50 questions back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12692)|
| 3:31:37| Some of the questions were probably better answered by the BMX community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12697)|
| 3:31:40| and some were for purchasing and finance, and I sent it over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12700)|
| 3:31:45| I want to get our follow-up date and time set on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12705)|
| 3:31:50| because it's kind of been hanging out there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12710)|
| 3:31:53| There was some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| I posted it on the forum, and there were two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| We could meet either after the budget hearing on the 29th was one point that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12717)|
| 3:32:02| Commissioner Jay weighed in with a point of maybe letting us get through the budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12722)|
| 3:32:07| so we can put some more intentional thought on it as a discussion item this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12727)|
| 3:32:12| I have not yet received all the answers to the questions yet from purchasing and finance and everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12732)|
| 3:32:20| and I'm sure that the BMX community, there are some questions about it on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12740)|
| 3:32:25| that it would probably be best to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12745)|
| 3:32:28| So what I'd like to do is, yes, I know the meeting's late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12748)|
| 3:32:31| but I would like to get a little bit of closure as we're closing out this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12751)|
| 3:32:34| before we wrap up our final bit of budget discussion on what is going to be the most productive use of our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12754)|
| 3:32:40| to revisit this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12760)|
| 3:32:42| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12762)|
| 3:32:43| I might suggest that you, in July, call it or sometime, pick the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12763)|
| 3:32:48| but call a special chairman's briefing for two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12768)|
| 3:32:51| and we dedicate one hour to BMX and one hour to the fire study discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12771)|
| 3:32:57| That way we're there, we're all in one place, we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12777)|
| 3:33:00| prepare well in advance and bring in, you know, applicable parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12780)|
| 3:33:04| It's almost, you know, it may take more time than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12784)|
| 3:33:08| but I feel like those are two big topics that will probably take more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12788)|
| 3:33:12| I think the fire one will especially take more time than we have in the retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12792)|
| 3:33:15| to think about the big, big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12795)|
| 3:33:17| So maybe we could pair those two together, and that way everybody's in one space at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12797)|
| 3:33:22| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12802)|
| 3:33:23| A suggestion to Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12805)|
| 3:33:26| I guess I'm kind of, I'm a little bit, with the BMX, our mayor has said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12806)|
| 3:33:35| and it was not put into funding because of the cost of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12815)|
| 3:33:44| and I was under the impression that we were already trying to get the football field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12824)|
| 3:33:52| at South Oil Middle back into where they could at least have that field to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12832)|
| 3:34:02| So is the BMX, is this still really on county radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12842)|
| 3:34:08| thinking that we're going to build this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12848)|
| 3:34:14| I guess I'm a little confused why we're still pursuing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12854)|
| 3:34:21| I want to go back very clearly to the March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12861)|
| 3:34:24| We talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12864)|
| 3:34:25| It was actually extended out of public forum and ended up being a very long discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12865)|
| 3:34:29| but when we cut it off, the commission was very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12869)|
| 3:34:33| it was very clear to me that you all wanted to come back to revisit this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12873)|
| 3:34:38| To make sure the time was productive, I sent out a questionnaire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12878)|
| 3:34:41| because I didn't want us just to be talking about it and got a lot of questions back on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12881)|
| 3:34:46| So I just want to follow through on your request to revisit this particular item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12886)|
| 3:34:52| and either look at it as a learning opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12892)|
| 3:34:55| or if it's something that we put to bed for right now and then revisit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12895)|
| 3:35:00| but I just want to try to get all your questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12900)|
| 3:35:03| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12903)|
| 3:35:04| Yeah, in regards to Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12904)|
| 3:35:07| if you're going to limit the fire discussion to an hour, there's no reason to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12907)|
| 3:35:11| This is a long process, and I think the BMX would not be justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12911)|
| 3:35:15| If we're going to have that conversation, I don't think an hour would justify that either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12915)|
| 3:35:18| so I think you separate those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12918)|
| 3:35:21| It really is going to take a team effort on this fire study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12921)|
| 3:35:24| and if you're not on board with having that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12924)|
| 3:35:28| I don't think you guys understand how important it is for the future of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12928)|
| 3:35:33| Not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12933)|
| 3:35:34| What we have today is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12934)|
| 3:35:37| It's very good in a lot of areas, but there's got to be improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12937)|
| 3:35:40| There's got to be sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12940)|
| 3:35:42| So we're the third largest county in the state, and I think we ought to act like it sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12942)|
| 3:35:48| But don't limit it to an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12948)|
| 3:35:50| Might as well not have the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12950)|
| 3:35:52| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12952)|
| 3:35:53| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12953)|
| 3:35:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12954)|
| 3:35:57| The BMX is still an issue in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12957)|
| 3:36:00| It is still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12960)|
| 3:36:01| It is still a live issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12961)|
| 3:36:04| We owe it to the BMX people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12964)|
| 3:36:06| We promised them a meeting, and I think we ought to follow through with that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12966)|
| 3:36:10| I know BMX USA wants to come and address you personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| the president or his vice president at USA National,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12974)|
| 3:36:18| tell him what they will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12978)|
| 3:36:20| One of the questions was how much money do they need to raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12980)|
| 3:36:23| That question will be answered at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12983)|
| 3:36:27| They will have some skin in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12987)|
| 3:36:29| So, yes, we do need to carry on the conversation, and I agree with Brad 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12989)|
| 3:36:36| An hour is not going to do justice to either subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=12996)|
| 3:36:40| Okay. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13000)|
| 3:36:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13001)|
| 3:36:43| I would simply echo what is said, but I want to speak specifically to the issue of fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13003)|
| 3:36:48| because I appreciate the work that was done for that study dealing with our issues of fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13008)|
| 3:36:55| What was absent from that conversation is the conversation we needed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13015)|
| 3:36:59| with the people who provided that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13019)|
| 3:37:02| So we don't have a conversation in a county capacity with the people who provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13022)|
| 3:37:10| It was not a part of the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| They were not asked any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13032)|
| 3:37:14| and we were presented with a comprehensive study looking at the issue of fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13034)|
| 3:37:19| from their perspective about what we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13039)|
| 3:37:23| I would like to hear what our rescue squad, both city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13043)|
| 3:37:28| need to look at in terms of addressing that critical issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13048)|
| 3:37:36| All of the agents were engaged in the study from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13056)|
| 3:37:39| We didn't hear from them that day because it was the culmination of the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13059)|
| 3:37:42| and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13062)|
| 3:37:44| All of them need to be at the table to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13064)|
| 3:37:47| but they were all providing information and being interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13067)|
| 3:37:51| and some more cooperative than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13071)|
| 3:37:54| But they were all at the table, and they knew the content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13074)|
| 3:37:59| and they know the conversations that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| We've had them for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13081)|
| 3:38:03| But I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13083)|
| 3:38:04| They should be here when we have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13084)|
| 3:38:06| It shouldn't just be us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13086)|
| 3:38:08| But there's a lot to discuss, and we've got to check our egos at the door on all of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13088)|
| 3:38:13| because some feelings are going to get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13093)|
| 3:38:16| It's just the way that process is going to have to play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13096)|
| 3:38:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13098)|
| 3:38:19| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13099)|
| 3:38:20| I just want to add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13100)|
| 3:38:21| I would agree with you with the elongated time on the FIRE study for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13101)|
| 3:38:27| perhaps both topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| Just one thing I wanted to point out with that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| regarding Commissioner Gill's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13112)|
| 3:38:35| just recently I talked to her chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| and I sent a letter asking to each one of those departments that were named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13117)|
| 3:38:42| in the study to just give us some kind of response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| What did they think of the study so that we could then hear from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13126)|
| 3:38:51| bring them to the table, and have a bigger discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| So I did send a letter to each of those agencies just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13133)|
| 3:38:58| this was the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13138)|
| 3:38:59| We talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13139)|
| 3:39:00| We were going to talk about it later this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13140)|
| 3:39:01| Would you please send us something back to tell us what you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13141)|
| 3:39:04| so that we could think about it in a more comprehensive way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13144)|
| 3:39:07| If I get a response from those departments, I'll certainly share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13147)|
| 3:39:11| And I do think that all of them should be invited to a bigger conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13151)|
| 3:39:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13154)|
| 3:39:15| I'd like to go ahead and just make some decisions so we can kind of move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13155)|
| 3:39:18| Let's look at a chairman's briefing in August to talk about the FIRE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13158)|
| 3:39:22| that gives everybody roughly, we'll get through the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13162)|
| 3:39:25| that will give roughly a June, July, and the first couple of weeks in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13165)|
| 3:39:29| to build up to review that in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| Then to knock out, I know that we as a team agreed that we would revisit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13172)|
| 3:39:38| the BMX discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13178)|
| 3:39:40| We owe that and we owe that to that community to revisit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13180)|
| 3:39:43| and to look at all the questions that all of you all sent in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13183)|
| 3:39:46| I'd like to, I don't know that I want to do that during a work session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13186)|
| 3:39:51| It could go on a little bit long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| I am open to doing that as posted on the forum to get it done immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13193)|
| 3:39:58| following our planned budget workshop on the, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13198)|
| 3:40:04| we will need to make a decision if we're voting on the budget on the 29th of this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13204)|
| 3:40:09| that could impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13209)|
| 3:40:10| But I know that what we posted on the commissioner's forum as an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13210)|
| 3:40:14| would be to revisit to have our BMX discussion on the 29th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13214)|
| 3:40:19| after the previously scheduled budget workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13219)|
| 3:40:24| However, there is some motion to, go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13224)|
| 3:40:28| We do realize there's a big pile of dirt over at South Dole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| that we've made a commitment to those people in that community to do something with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13231)|
| 3:40:35| Yeah, well, that's sooner or later to deal with that pile of dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13235)|
| 3:40:39| But is that our decision as a commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| What are they going to do with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13241)|
| 3:40:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13242)|
| 3:40:44| I thought we were already working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13244)|
| 3:40:46| I mean, I thought the plan was they would start to remove the pile of dirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13246)|
| 3:40:51| as soon as school was out so that the track and everything could be ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13251)|
| 3:40:54| for the start of school next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13254)|
| 3:40:57| Yeah, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| Yes, sir, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13259)|
| 3:41:00| I was talking to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13260)|
| 3:41:01| Yeah, we have a couple different options that we're working to remove the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13261)|
| 3:41:05| I spoke with Kristen Grove with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13265)|
| 3:41:08| Her schedule is such that the track and the field can be stabilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13268)|
| 3:41:13| and complete before the school starts in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13273)|
| 3:41:16| We need to have everything off the track by the first or second week of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13276)|
| 3:41:20| So regardless of which scenario we take to remove the dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13280)|
| 3:41:24| the dirt will be off the track to allow for PBA to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13284)|
| 3:41:27| so that there are no delays in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13287)|
| 3:41:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13291)|
| 3:41:32| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| Just to clarify, were you saying that you wanted to have the BMX discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13294)|
| 3:41:39| next week at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| Yeah, I was proposing, and we posted that to the commissioner's form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13301)|
| 3:41:44| One of the options, if we wanted to do that this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13304)|
| 3:41:47| would be to do it after the originally scheduled budget review session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13307)|
| 3:41:53| which is on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13313)|
| 3:41:55| But will we have some of the answers that we were looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13315)|
| 3:41:59| That I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13319)|
| 3:42:00| I have not gotten the answers back from the finance team, purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13320)|
| 3:42:04| That's why I'm wondering if it's too quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13324)|
| 3:42:06| I don't know, because we could always do another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13326)|
| 3:42:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13328)|
| 3:42:09| Mr. Caldwell, I know you're one of the folks that I had sent those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13329)|
| 3:42:12| that myriad of questions to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13332)|
| 3:42:14| You guys got a timeline on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13334)|
| 3:42:16| I think it was you all and purchasing and some of the other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13336)|
| 3:42:20| You should have those back by Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13340)|
| 3:42:23| This week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13343)|
| 3:42:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13344)|
| 3:42:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13345)|
| 3:42:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13346)|
| 3:42:27| And then just to follow up, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13347)|
| 3:42:29| I think you said to go ahead and have the budget vote on that Wednesday, the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13349)|
| 3:42:34| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13354)|
| 3:42:35| Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13355)|
| 3:42:36| Thursday, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13356)|
| 3:42:38| Here's where we are on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13360)|
| 3:42:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13361)|
| 3:42:42| We are currently discussing the BMX item and scheduling the vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13362)|
| 3:42:46| What I'd like to do is, right now we're transitioning into trying to schedule stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13366)|
| 3:42:51| Let's close the discussion on that and then move quickly to the budget discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13371)|
| 3:42:56| because our budget vote options are this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13376)|
| 3:42:59| We can vote on the budget on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13379)|
| 3:43:01| If we decide to do that tonight, we've got adequate time to notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13381)|
| 3:43:05| If this body would like additional time to continue to review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13385)|
| 3:43:08| we can keep the originally scheduled budget vote date in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13388)|
| 3:43:12| But if we choose to vote on the budget on the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13392)|
| 3:43:15| then that could potentially impact the timing of the BMX discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13395)|
| 3:43:22| I mean, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13402)|
| 3:43:25| So, Commissioner Daly, Chris has said that he could get all the counties' responses back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13405)|
| 3:43:32| I mean, you saw the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13412)|
| 3:43:33| Most of their response is back by Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13413)|
| 3:43:37| And then I know we probably want to make sure that the BMX community has had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13417)|
| 3:43:40| They've probably seen those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13420)|
| 3:43:41| You may have even forwarded it on to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13421)|
| 3:43:44| Some of those were probably best addressed by them, more so than even us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13424)|
| 3:43:48| if it's around the track stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13428)|
| 3:43:50| Is that a discussion that they would be capable of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13430)|
| 3:43:54| Do you think we'll have enough data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13434)|
| 3:43:56| And we're so close to getting the budget done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| I don't want to get too, no pun intended, off track at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13438)|
| 3:44:04| I want to make sure we get our budget done, but I do want to just—this thing is killing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13444)|
| 3:44:08| I want to kind of get it knocked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13448)|
| 3:44:10| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13450)|
| 3:44:12| That is a Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13452)|
| 3:44:14| That should be a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13454)|
| 3:44:15| I just need to—we need to set a date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| so the President will either have to come out of Texas or California, one of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13457)|
| 3:44:22| So he'll have to fly in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13462)|
| 3:44:23| We just need to know—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13463)|
| 3:44:24| Is that a discussion that we could do in June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13464)|
| 3:44:26| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13466)|
| 3:44:27| You know, if that might give them enough time to get—we'd have all the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13467)|
| 3:44:32| and they could schedule a strip with adequate timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13472)|
| 3:44:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13475)|
| 3:44:36| I mean, I know you can't speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13476)|
| 3:44:38| I'll speak from tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13478)|
| 3:44:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| You set the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13481)|
| 3:44:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13482)|
| 3:44:43| You'll make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13483)|
| 3:44:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13484)|
| 3:44:45| I'll make it happen in June, and by then we'll have our budget done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13485)|
| 3:44:48| and we can give it the intentionality that it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13488)|
| 3:44:50| We're talking June 6th, or what are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13490)|
| 3:44:52| The budget vote will be—well, now I'm talking about the BMX, not the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13492)|
| 3:44:57| We can look at scheduling BMX as a chairman's briefing in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13497)|
| 3:45:02| probably a day of the work session, maybe earlier that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13502)|
| 3:45:06| Yeah, the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13506)|
| 3:45:07| The 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13507)|
| 3:45:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13509)|
| 3:45:10| So we've decided we will do a revisit FIRE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| and August we'll revisit and knock out BMX, at least this initial thing in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13513)|
| 3:45:18| And now moving on, Madam Clerk, is there any additional items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13518)|
| 3:45:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13523)|
| 3:45:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13524)|
| 3:45:25| So the last item we've got is to get to finishing our budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13525)|
| 3:45:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13528)|
| 3:45:29| Rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13529)|
| 3:45:30| You had something on rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13530)|
| 3:45:31| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13531)|
| 3:45:32| I apologize, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13532)|
| 3:45:33| I know you had added at the beginning of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13533)|
| 3:45:35| a discussion about scheduling a rules committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13535)|
| 3:45:38| Real quickly, I want to have a brief, short rules committee meeting on June 17th at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13538)|
| 3:45:49| I'm thinking that we have an ordinance that's on here that we are going to have to have a public hearing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13549)|
| 3:45:56| that maybe we could do the public hearing for this ordinance if it passes following that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13556)|
| 3:46:03| So June 17th at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13563)|
| 3:46:07| In here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13567)|
| 3:46:08| In here, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13568)|
| 3:46:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13569)|
| 3:46:10| Does that work for everybody that's on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13570)|
| 3:46:13| We have an audit committee that day, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13573)|
| 3:46:18| Could that committee meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13578)|
| 3:46:20| Can we check availability if we have an audit in here and if that meeting wants to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13580)|
| 3:46:24| It's at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13584)|
| 3:46:25| It's at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13585)|
| 3:46:26| So you've got to be done at 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13586)|
| 3:46:27| I mean, it would be fast, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13587)|
| 3:46:28| Yeah, we're not going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13588)|
| 3:46:29| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13589)|
| 3:46:30| We could revisit the BMX around that because we just decided that we'd also revisit BMX before the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13590)|
| 3:46:39| We could do budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13599)|

| 3:48:29| But I would like to see if any of my fellow commissioners have any other budget requests or questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13709)|
| 3:48:37| while we have our direct reports here and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13717)|
| 3:48:42| Is there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13722)|
| 3:48:44| Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13724)|

| 3:48:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13726)|
| 3:48:47| What is our budget process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| Line by line, total budget, what is our process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13729)|
| 3:48:52| I mean, what is the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13732)|
| 3:48:55| Historically, we've always voted for the budget in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13735)|
| 3:48:58| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13738)|
| 3:49:00| So we're indicating that's what this process is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13740)|
| 3:49:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13744)|
| 3:49:05| If we want to vote on the budget in its entirety, we vote on the budget in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13745)|
| 3:49:12| Sorry, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13752)|
| 3:49:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13755)|
| 3:49:16| If there's any continuing questions, we can vote on the budget on June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13756)|
| 3:49:19| No, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13759)|
| 3:49:20| I'm just wondering for the process, is that how it's laid out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13760)|
| 3:49:23| I mean, I have the rules over here, but I haven't looked at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| Is that how it's laid out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13765)|
| 3:49:26| Is it laid out as a yes or no, all in, all out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13766)|
| 3:49:29| Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13769)|
| 3:49:30| Or is there a check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13770)|
| 3:49:32| It's a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13772)|
| 3:49:34| I think what they're actually asking is, is it up or down vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13774)|
| 3:49:39| Which, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| You can make amendments to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13781)|
| 3:49:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13784)|
| 3:49:46| Yeah, there can be amendments, modifications, if you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13786)|
| 3:49:51| In recent memory, there hasn't been any significant modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| It's usually been voted as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13794)|
| 3:50:00| Technically, the budget is approved at the major category level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13800)|
| 3:50:06| Technically, when it's adopted and approved, it's at the major category level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13806)|
| 3:50:12| which would be personnel, benefits, contractual services, supplies and materials, and other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13812)|
| 3:50:19| Then there's a category for debt service as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13819)|
| 3:50:22| Technically, that's where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13822)|
| 3:50:24| Now, you will approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13824)|
| 3:50:26| You'll have a resolution to adopt the budget, set the tax rate, and then the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13826)|
| 3:50:32| There's three resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13832)|
| 3:50:35| You approve the budget as a total resolution, but it breaks it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13835)|
| 3:50:40| Technically, you're approving it at the major category level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13840)|
| 3:50:44| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13844)|
| 3:50:46| That helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13846)|
| 3:50:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13848)|
| 3:50:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13849)|
| 3:50:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13850)|
| 3:50:51| What I'd like to do tonight, we have scheduled our budget vote for June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13851)|
| 3:50:56| We've had extensive budget conversation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13856)|
| 3:51:00| Gosh, it's 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13860)|
| 3:51:02| My question that I'd like to determine is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13862)|
| 3:51:06| would this body like to vote on the budget on June 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13866)|
| 3:51:09| which would give you plenty of time to do additional research if needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13869)|
| 3:51:14| or we have talked about it, we will also have next Monday to discuss the budget as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13874)|
| 3:51:19| if you'd like to vote on the budget on Wednesday the 29th at our scheduled budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13879)|
| 3:51:27| I'd like to get some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13887)|
| 3:51:28| As it stands, we'll be on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13888)|
| 3:51:33| But if this body would like to vote on it earlier, I am open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13893)|
| 3:51:39| But as it stands, we're voting on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13899)|
| 3:51:41| It's 10 o'clock almost, and we're still talking about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13901)|
| 3:51:44| Do you want to show of hands who wants to vote next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13904)|
| 3:51:49| How do you want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13909)|
| 3:51:51| Well, I'd like to get, frankly, I'd just like to have any, is there any pros or cons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13911)|
| 3:51:55| You all have got to have opinions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13915)|
| 3:51:57| I mean, would you like to have more time to research?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13917)|
| 3:51:59| Would you like to have more time to talk to department heads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13919)|
| 3:52:02| We've been talking about it in one way, shape, or another almost this entire meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13922)|
| 3:52:08| So, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13928)|
| 3:52:09| We said June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13929)|
| 3:52:11| I put in June 6th, so let's go with June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13931)|
| 3:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13933)|
| 3:52:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13935)|
| 3:52:17| Is that your line, or is that Mr. J's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13937)|
| 3:52:20| All right, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13940)|
| 3:52:21| If it stays as June 6th, do we still keep the 29th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13941)|
| 3:52:25| I guess that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13945)|
| 3:52:26| Do we have enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13946)|
| 3:52:28| Do we have enough questions to do another session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13948)|
| 3:52:30| We'll have time to discuss the budget next Monday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13950)|
| 3:52:33| I think people can't get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13953)|
| 3:52:34| Excuse me, Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13954)|
| 3:52:35| Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13955)|
| 3:52:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13956)|

| 3:52:40| But, yeah, we'll discuss the budget next Tuesday, and then at that time on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13960)|
| 3:52:46| if we would like to cancel the meeting on the 29th, I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13966)|
| 3:52:49| But you've already got a public notice at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13969)|
| 3:52:51| I mean, can I be recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13971)|
| 3:52:55| Go ahead, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13975)|
| 3:52:56| Why don't you do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13976)|
| 3:52:57| Why don't you put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13977)|
| 3:52:58| You can't decide between the 29th and the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13978)|
| 3:53:01| Put it on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13981)|
| 3:53:03| If for some reason you can't get the act together, then move it to the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13983)|
| 3:53:08| Because we can always delay it then, delay the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13988)|
| 3:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13992)|
| 3:53:13| Even though you public noticed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13993)|
| 3:53:14| Why do two public notices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13994)|
| 3:53:15| They cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13995)|
| 3:53:16| But if you show up and you can't reach a conclusion, you can defer it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=13996)|
| 3:53:21| Public notices cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| Why do two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14003)|
| 3:53:26| I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14006)|
| 3:53:27| Here's what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| After hearing everything tonight, let's vote on the budget on the 6th, and our time on the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14009)|
| 3:53:34| we can use that to focus on BMX if we think you can get the guy in, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14014)|
| 3:53:41| Call him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14021)|

| 3:53:44| Yeah, we've already got the time budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| That's what I'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14026)|
| 3:53:47| Go ahead, Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=14027)|
