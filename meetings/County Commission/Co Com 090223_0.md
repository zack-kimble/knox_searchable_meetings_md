| 0:00:15| Since this is the meeting of the county commission and the beer board was handled as a separate entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=15)|
| 0:00:25| I think under abundance of caution, I think that this commission should go ahead and re-adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=25)|
| 0:00:32| all ordinances and rules that the beer board was following so that there just be no mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=32)|

| 0:01:34| Ingalls Market, Inc., number 3047466 Oak Ridge Highway, Ingalls Market, Inc., owner, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| Which member of the Sheriff's Department will be presenting this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Please state your name for the record and proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| Alan May, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=111)|
| 0:02:03| On February 4, 2009, we conducted an undercover beer sting, and at Ingalls on Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=123)|
| 0:02:14| we had a gentleman that sold beer to our underage undercover person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| Would you please advise the board specifically what you mean by undercover sting and how that was effectuated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| We actually use officers that work for our employees from the Sheriff's Office that are under the age of 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| and we actually send them in to the different businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| They attempt to purchase alcohol by whatever means, depending on if it's a convenience store, a grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=161)|
| 0:02:52| or a place that serves alcohol on premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| And they purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| They walk up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| If they're asked for ID, they use their real driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| They actually hand them to the clerk if they ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| And if not, then they bring the beer up, pay for it, come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| And once they come out of the parking lot, myself and Lieutenant Brunman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| we go in and issue a citation for sale of alcohol to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| Your statement reads that this is the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| What is the date of the first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| I believe it was May of 09, or 08, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| May of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Mr. Chairman, I'll defer to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| If the board has any questions of this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Are there any questions, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Not of this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| I want to speak to what was the fine previously and what actions have been taken for the Ingalls since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=223)|
| 0:03:52| In terms of the fine scheme, in accordance with your rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| the first offense for sale to a minor is a 30-day suspension or a $500 fine at the option of the violating party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=236)|
| 0:04:05| Your second offense, if it's within 36 months of the first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| you're required to either impose a 60-day suspension or, on the alternative, a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| Are they a responsible vendor for the State of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| I do not believe so, but I believe there's a representative from Ingalls who can attest to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| as well as whatever remedial measures they've taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Is there a representative for Ingalls here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| Would you come forward, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| State your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=269)|
| 0:04:43| Steve Albright, store manager at Ingalls Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Is this employee still with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| What measures have you taken since now your second offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| What measures have you taken inside your store to make sure this doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| We're monitoring the front real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Everybody's been to the beer classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| We're just trying to monitor the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| That's about all I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| I'll make a motion we do either a 60-day or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Do you have something, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Sir, do you know if the clerk actually looked at the driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| Did they ask for it or did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| He asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I ran the tape back and looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| So he looked at it but just didn't notice that he wasn't old enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| He said it looked like he was 84 is what the employee said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| I wasn't there, but my co-manager was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| So he asked for the license, looked at it and gave it back to him and then proceeded on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| So he had an opportunity to not do this if he had just paid attention to the date on the driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Sir, is your entity a part of the Responsible Vendor Act in accordance with Tennessee law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| I'm not for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I don't think the store would have to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| I don't think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| I'm not for sure on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Will, do you have any knowledge of that, whether or not I don't believe this is a responsible vendor case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| I just want to ask the gentleman there, what do you prefer, the $1,000 or the 60-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| The $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| Mr. May, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Do you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Do I now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| The undercover's ID says under 21 on the side in red letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=397)|
| 0:06:46| Motion on the floor, 60-day or $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| Did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Mr. Chair, it always falls to the employee who loses their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=415)|
| 0:07:04| And sometimes that may be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| I don't know how much training that person had or how long they'd been there or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| And generally, I've never seen anybody choose anything other than the financial penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| It seems to me if we are really serious about this, we might impose the 60-day revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| And that will really get, I think, the attention of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| and the attention of the other vendors that are engaged in the sale of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=450)|
| 0:07:40| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Mr. Chairman, just so that everybody knows out in the audience and for this gentleman right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| I believe they have, it's only, what, seven days, five days in order to pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| To pay the fine if that's what you wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| 5B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| Powell Chevron, 7135 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| Patricia G. Coker, owner, First Defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Ms. Coker in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Who's presenting this case on behalf of the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=502)|
| 0:08:34| On June 29, 2008, we conducted a sting operation at Powell Chevron on 7135 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=514)|
| 0:08:45| Undercover officer bought a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| And basically we run all the stings the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| They go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| If they ask for ID, we give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| One of the things that we've noticed is sometimes after they look at the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| they punch it in the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| They also override the cash register so that it still sells, the beer can still be sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| even though they know that they're under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Please state your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Patricia Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| And what is your relationship to Powell Chevron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Have you heard the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Do you admit or deny the defense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| I'll defer to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| Yes, this question for Wolfie or Mr. Minot, I guess, or maybe one of the other merchants here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| Do all the cash registers, we've heard this two or three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| do they have the ability to, when they punch the date in the cash register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| that it will kick it back if they're not eligible to buy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| Not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Most of your big convenience stores and or the grocery stores do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| Does yours have it, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| And they still chose to override it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| She read the date on the license as 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| Is she still employed with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| She is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Again, what steps have you taken to see that this doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| This lady was already scheduled to go through the, I'm sorry, the beer training class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| and all the other measures that we've taken is putting, you know, the register in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| to where they'd have to key the date in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| So she had not been through the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Not at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| How long had she been employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| Just a very short period of time, a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| And, you know, I'll ask you all's indulgence as this is my first beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| so I may ask some questions that may already be answered in previous meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| The training, is the training, and this may be to the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| is the training mandatory prior to having permission to sell alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| or this is something that you get once you get into the program or you're caught with an offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| Normally, sir, the training has to be conducted within 30 days of employment if they sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| So there's a 30-day grace period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| And this under 21, is this in, I think I've seen it, but it's along the small edge of the driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=696)|
| 0:11:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| And it's in distinct lettering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| And they're likewise redlined and they read underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| And some of the more modern cash registers will actually alert the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| And the problem you're getting is they're hairy, they're in a hurry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| they override the system to preclude having to go through that extra step of swiping the card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| and having it actually alert them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| I think that's where the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Did you have something to add to that, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Thank you, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| I would love to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| I'll pass it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Yes, Mr. Law Director, it used to be that the person selling this beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=743)|
| 0:12:31| that they lost their job and could not work around an establishment for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| It sold beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| That was the practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| That's not a legal requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| What if they were found guilty that they were no longer allowed to work in an establishment where they sold beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| Well, we're distinguishing between that, which you do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| and what happens actually if the individual employee is taken to criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| They do assess and the state will impose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| But that's nothing you'll oppose at this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| But for some reason I feel like that we need to look and see what we can do about these people or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| and maybe not the first time find them guilty because we're putting people out of work that need these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| Most of them pay minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| And, you know, for the first time they're found guilty in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| and most of them plead guilty because the fines are small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| But yet we're maybe sending these people out on the Unemployment Bureau where they're not qualified to work anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| I don't know what we can do to adjust this, but we certainly need to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| And the only person that really suffers with a big fine is the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| Right now that's up to the employer whether they dismiss them or take a chance that they're going to do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Yes, legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| If they're found guilty in court, though, I think they have to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| Is that not correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| They can't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| If they're found guilty in court, they cannot work at an establishment that sells beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| That means they can't bag groceries at Kroger's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| They can't work at these mini markets or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| I just feel like we need to look out and maybe try to revise this and find some solution to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Well, the law is generally designed to preclude them from getting a server's license and actually serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| It doesn't necessarily preclude them from further employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| It just precludes them from direct contact with alcohol or the sale thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| But nevertheless, we can certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| They can't stock it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| They can't bag it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| Would that not be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| They can't handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Well, again, I think the spirit of the law is that they don't actually come in contact with sales or transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| But nevertheless, we can look at your ordinance as we revise it and give you some proposals to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| My statement or question was similar to what Commissioner McKenzie asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| By having teenagers and knowing the difference in driver's license being under 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| and when they turn 21 getting their driver's license basically just so it doesn't say they're under 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| it amazes me how anybody that checks these are looking at the dates and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| oh, I thought it was 77 or I thought it was 82, when it clearly states they're under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| There's no doubt if you look at the Tennessee driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| there's no doubt that someone is under 21 unless they're using a fake ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| So I'm amazed at how we get anybody up here if they've shown their actual driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| which we know the ones going in from the sheriff's department is showing their driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| how anybody could use that as an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| I don't know if anybody has an answer for that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| but that really bothers me that anyone could come up here and use that as an excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| that they looked at the date wrong or they didn't understand it when they don't even have to figure out if they're 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| just look at the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| That's something that really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| Do you have anything else you'd like to add, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| The penalty for a first-time offense is a 30-day suspension or a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| If the board ultimately decides to impose this, what would you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| A fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| I'll defer to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| Officer May, I had a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| Are you using the same undercover person to visit these last two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1012)|
| 0:17:01| Is it the same person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| We have three or four different people that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| There was some mention that the person before who was surprised or sold underage, that he looked like he was very old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1029)|
| 0:17:19| Like, does this person have some kind of disease that prematurely ages them or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| We make them go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| We don't allow them to wear ball caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| If they have any tattoos on their arms, we make them wear long sleeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| We use young people that are between 18 and 20 that work for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| They may be a clerk that works in records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| They may work in maintenance or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| But they're under the age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| They have to have their real driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| It's not faded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| We've not washed it through the washing machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| So their driver's license looks like this one that you're giving us a sample of with the red around the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| And it says under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Well, that just means to me that there's an intent by the person who's selling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| I don't know what the rest of the board thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| But I think there's an obvious intent to circumvent these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| And I've asked the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| I've asked Mr. Jarrett once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| And I don't know if he's got any response to this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| But I think there also, as well as considerations of what we're doing, as Finbar said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| maybe the monetary fund to the business is not working so well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| that there also should be some monetary fund possibly to the server, to the person who makes the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| And so I think that's something that we ought to consider as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Just whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| We've got to step it up, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Just to kind of echo what Commissioners Norman and Saunders were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| I don't think that there is a business that has come before us, maybe one or two, that wants to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| I mean, I don't think that they relish the fact of coming down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| and saying that one of their employees has sold to an underage and that now they're having to do the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| My sense is that, as Commissioner Pingston said, that these people are basically minimum wage type people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| You, as the business owner, you're kind of at their mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| I mean, you can send them through the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| You can tell them not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| You can tell them what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| You can't be there 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| And so if someone comes in and an employee chooses to do this, you're the one down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| You're the one that's having to take the hit in terms of paying the fine or the revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| And so I would like to ask our law director if you could look into possibly what could be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| with these folks who choose to do this, because it is a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| They have chosen to sell to an underage, even though they have the IDs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| And so I know that they lose their job, but chances are they're going to go right down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| and find another job somewhere else doing something, or they'll go across into another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| I don't know exactly what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| But also it would just seem to me that if there's more of a penalty on the individual who has to make that purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| that might be more of a deterrent, because I just don't think that businesses want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| I don't think you want to pay these $500,000 fines, but there's only so much you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| because you're at the mercy of the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| So if there's a way we could look at an employee of doing something there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| I would be in favor of asking our law director to look at that and see if there is a possibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Let me ask you, when the sheriff's department, when you do these things and then you come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| do you find those people right back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| Or do these people lay them off for two weeks or a week or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| You know, everybody says, yeah, I got rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| And I've heard that with other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| And, you know, get rid of them for two or three days or two or three weeks, two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| What do you find when you go back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| We've never gotten the same person at the same business as far back as I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1257)|

| 0:21:44| and went into Hot Iron and Rawhide on Old Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1304)|

| 0:22:28| Did you admit or deny the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| I admit the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| I'll defer to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Commissioner Luevo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| How long have you been in business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| About a year and three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| So you were in business for maybe about six months before this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Yes, I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| And was this clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| This clerk worked with his mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| His mother owned the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| I bought the business from his mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| And they had the business for about two to three years that he had worked there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| He still works there with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| He went through the courts, paid the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| It's his only time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| And believe me, he did look at the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| He just did not see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| It was the first time in his work selling beer for, I know, six years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| And he's a good person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| And it was just an unfortunate mistake that he done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| And he went to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| He paid the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| And then whatever he needed to so that he could continue to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| So he's still in your employment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| He still works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Will you give him a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| I've got a gentleman right behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| We did another sting operation Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| And this same gentleman that was an employee that we got, he did check ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| And did not sell that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1460)|

| 0:27:29| Sir, have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession, sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1649)|

| 0:27:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Has beer ever been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Is there an outstanding license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Sir, if you'd like to identify yourself, if you'd like to speak, there is a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| State your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I'm Karim Bughani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| I'm the owner of Ian's Market No. 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| So there is currently a license there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Okay, and you know that if this board grants you a license, the old license has to be surrendered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Will this application be for on or off-premises beer sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Off-premises beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Does anybody else have an interest in this business besides you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| Well, I guess him and his wife are the partners in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Who's going to actually operate the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| That gentleman there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Gentlemen, are you both familiar with the beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity or in agreement with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| I've already been to the beer class before, and he's already got his tips ticket, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| So he's already been to the beer board training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Pending what, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| They didn't come to the Sheriff's Department to get a fingerprint card and a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| Do you understand that requirement, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| I just got the beer permit at that store three months ago, and I never did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1765)|
| 0:29:35| As a matter of fact, I got two permits in Knox County in the last four months, and I haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| This isn't a corporate name, Lieutenant, so it would be different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| If it was a private individual, it's in a corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| It's under the CION Enterprise Incorporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| I don't believe that's in our beer laws that it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| It's something you ought to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| The manager needs to be fingerprinted and pictured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1798)|
| 0:30:07| This has been going on for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| Ever since I've been the beer inspector, we've had a photograph and a fingerprint card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| According to the clerk's recollection, not when we're dealing with a corporate entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| Well, that may not be in the record, but they send a list of all the people that were connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| and we do run a background check on them because they send a list of the people that's corporate officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1829)|
| 0:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| We currently have that information on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| I'll defer to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Does anyone have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Sorry, but I just want to be clear going forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| Entities, enterprises do or do not have the fingerprint requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| Is there a requirement for a person, a manager, a group of owners to have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| The way our current order of practice has been when we're dealing with a corporate entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| is they do a background investigation, and then ultimately we get a certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| Did you get a certificate of registration, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| We are in good standing with our EIN number, and we have a sales tax registration too, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1885)|
| 0:31:35| Did you get one recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| We formed a corporation last month, and we got our sales tax certificate last month too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| We'll need a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I've got it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| I'll make a motion to approve pending verification of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Update on the following establishment, 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| So you've been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| You just need to turn in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| You've been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Yeah, just pending the turning in that registration there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| I'll turn it in to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| We'll need that, and we'll also need the old beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Yeah, I've got the old beer permit, sales tax registration from the old and new owners, and the EIN number too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| so I'll go see Angie later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| Dollar General Store number 9808, 7603 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Dalton Corporation, Inc., owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| This is deferred from the January 2009 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1960)|
| 0:32:49| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| State your name for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| It's U.K. Mining, Knox County Beer Board Inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| I talked to the manager of Dollar General at 830 this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| and he's still waiting on approval from the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1982)|
| 0:33:11| This has been an ongoing case, members of the board, where initially this facility had a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=1991)|
| 0:33:20| Ultimately then they did some modifications, I believe, to the fire suppression system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| and there's been an ongoing debate basically between whether or not the fire marshal should go out and inspect the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2004)|
| 0:33:32| or the owner of the property should call for a reinspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| So at this point, did you go out there, Mr. Minot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| I was out there Friday, last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Did you notice the status of the fire suppression system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| I wouldn't know where the water would run or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| I think maybe all he likes is one of these lights that comes on if the building gets dark, the battery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| In fact, I don't know what he likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| Is there a representative here from the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| He said that he couldn't make it down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| He hadn't got the fire marshal back out there to check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| The fire marshal is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Did you all go out there and check it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| Please just state your name for the record, sir, and your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Mike Brown, deputy fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| We're the inspector who inspected that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| He's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| He had surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| We're checking with him right now to see if he did actually go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| We should have an answer here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| Members of the board, at this juncture, apparently this issue is still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| Obviously we don't have a representative here from the corporation to testify, nor do we know the status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2098)|
| 0:35:06| The only recourse would be to defer this once again to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| I do believe that these applications are good for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| Is that not right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| This started out last May, which we've already pushed it over the limit as far as extension of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2122)|
| 0:35:31| So is he going to have to reapply from square one again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| I would defer to the board's wisdom on that, but generally because it is not the fault of the applicant requiring him to reapply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| I believe they'd have a good case that they're basically being violated of their due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| Well, I would agree with Mr. Monahan on one thing, and I talked to the store owner myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| and they haven't been the most cooperative as far as getting things done in an expedient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2156)|
| 0:36:08| So I'm not sure whether they really want the permit or not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| I was just going to give you a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| State your name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Mike Brown, Knox County Deputy Fire Marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Would you speak with the inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2187)|

| 0:36:44| The board essentially has two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| One, defer this for 30 days or deny their permit and make them reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| How long is his permit for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| I mean, his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| How long does it last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| How long does the application last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Generally, they're good for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| We keep diverting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| I think we need to postpone it at least 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| And if he don't show up, cancel him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| Do you want to make that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Proper move and second that we postpone for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2238)|

| 0:37:22| 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| If I may, and if the board will indulge me, Commissioner McKenzie, ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| I normally keep these in a better fashion, but our rule that this board adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| and has re-adopted regarding corporations reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Corporations are exempt from the fingerprinting and photo requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| but most present a valid federal employer identification number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| and that will take care of this corporate entity we talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| So that meant that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| That a corporate entity would not have to be fingerprinted like an individual owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| So it was not pending, the Sheriff Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| If that was the sole reason that it was pending, then that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| And this board did ultimately approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| provided they provide us with the previous license and the registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| So they're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2287)|

| 0:43:02| With an on- and off-premises, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| He can serve people who are dining and he can likewise sell beer to go on this license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| So I guess I'm needing some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| When the clerk read it, it said on and off, and then when you asked the question, you asked was it on or off, and you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2593)|
| 0:43:22| and I'm just needing clarification there, please don't jump me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| So you asked him a question and he said on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| So generally speaking, are we approving whenever we say on, on, or off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| Is that what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| No, sir, I believe the gentleman clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| You're seeking to have on-premises sales and also if someone wants to take something to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| or are you just purely selling in the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| Normally we're permitted for both, but we only serve on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| But we just want to make sure your license is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| So do you want your license to read on-premises only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2639)|

| 0:44:03| I've eaten at his other restaurants many times, and I've never seen anybody take anything out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=2643)|

| 0:52:14| I didn't know that in the beginning, but this was through on me because it had never been a bar, not club, before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| that they told me I had to have architectural design come in and make sure of the exits and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3141)|

| 0:52:52| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| What type of establishment is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| It's a bar, nightclub, dance club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Why do you need off premise on the Zoya's on premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Well, it will have a restaurant portion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| But, see, I've done the on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| I can just have on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| I'm just asking you what your, my concern is if you buy, if you have an on and off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| they can take alcohol with them and it will promote them taking open alcohol with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| That concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| No, it's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| It has to be the bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| The top still has to be on it if you sell off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| You can't open it and take it out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| That's a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| So you're just wanting on or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| Well, I had a beer permit before in the city, and that one was on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| But that was the only option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| On this one, there was an option on or off, but I just marked both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| Is there a, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| Yeah, I'm like Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| I really don't think it's a good idea to have on and off premises together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| except under very unusual circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Even if the person doesn't walk out the door with an open container,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| because they've been in the bar drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| one of those containers are going to be opened about as quick as they get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| So I'd like to modify this to an on premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| I don't think this meets one of those very unusual situations where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| if you've got an area where there's not a place where people can buy beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| having the ability to pull up to a window outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| and buying some to take home is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| But it's really not a good idea to have folks sitting in a bar drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| and then being able to pick up beer on their way home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| because they're very likely to open it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| So I'd like to modify it to on premise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| Do you have an objection to that, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| I'm up to move and second for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| All in favor with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3295)|

| 0:55:01| Well, pending architectural codes and fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| And modifying to on premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3309)|

| 1:00:07| Our devotional will be led by Commissioner Amy Bras with our pledge of allegiance by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Let us stand and salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| of the United States of America, and to the Republic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Now, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| First, I want to thank Tank for inviting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| me to be responsible for this month's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| This is especially meaningful to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| after what happened at my church last July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| when a person full of hate and intolerance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| came in intending to kill all of those he believed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| to be different from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| And what a shock it must have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| to have his butt kicked by a bunch of pacifists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| Now, most of us up here are the product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| of Martin Luther and the Reformers, which sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| like a really great rock group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| So our devotionals are normally led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| by a Protestant Christian minister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| And there's nothing wrong with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| I'm personally a product of the philosophies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| and religious teachings of John Wesley and his methods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| which resulted in the Methodist Church, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| is where I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| However, my concern is that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| are many, many other religious groups in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| And although this commission represents them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| we rarely invite them to come be part of our devotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| or to give us their blessings before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| start work each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| And so this month, I have invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Christina Pleiss from the Tibetan Buddhist Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| to come and give us a blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| And I've also invited TJ Blazing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| who is a member of the Thunder Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| and a member of the Lakota Sioux Nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| He also happens to be my godfather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| to come up and give us a blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| So Christina, I'll let you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| And then TJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| And then I will have a short prayer afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| And thank you for this invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| I invite everyone to close their eyes and breathing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| as deeply as you can, and letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| go of all the thoughts that tie you to the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| and pull you into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| And the following is taken from a meditation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| by Thich Nhat Hanh, a famous Zen monk who was nominated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| for the Nobel Peace Prize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| May we listen deeply and with compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| in order to realize understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| May we speak truthfully with words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| that inspire self-confidence, joy, and hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3790)|
| 1:03:18| May we treat everyone with equanimity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| and resolve all differences, however small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| And I'd like to close with this thought from Albert Einstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| Our task must be to free ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| from this prison of feeling separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| by widening our circles of compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| in its beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| Thank you, Christina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3832)|
| 1:04:07| This is a message from the Thunder Beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| to Deciding Elders, which I will read as a member of the Thunder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| Society of Oglala Warriors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| We ask the elders sitting at this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| to be aware of the ever-present Spirit Father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| his ever-present love for Earth Mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| and their ever-present love for all their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| whoever they are, and in whatever condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| you may find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| We ask the elders to be mindful of these presences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| as they deliberate today to find the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| path through the scary forest of material considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| and political realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| This is our message from the Thunder Beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| I have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Thank you, TJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Can we all join hands, please, while we pray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| For the work that is before us, the friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| who are beside us, and the love and compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=3909)|

| 1:07:13| And of course, this interferes with her school time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| And I talked to her mother, and she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| felt like today may not be a good day for her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4040)|

| 1:20:41| Well, Stewart got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| Does anyone want to change your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| 13 for Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| 6 for Guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Stewart, if you're new, will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| to be the Judicial Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4860)|
| 1:21:00| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4860)|
| 1:21:09| Mr. Chairman, I had a couple of people call me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| And I told them that our, in effect, nominations were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| But we need to remind them again that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| will be a couple of slots opening back up in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| or July, so those that want to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| they need to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4883)|
| 1:21:31| Mr. Stewart, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| I simply wanted to say that I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| to thank all the members of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=4897)|

| 1:23:41| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5022)|
| 1:23:54| As Harry Truman used to say, the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| I am the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| I am the person that is responsible for the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| of the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| Recently, we've had a problem in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| We didn't create it, but we're going to clear it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| On that, you can rest assured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| And I want you to know, the management practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| of a prior previous administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| have been eliminated since I became trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| In particular, the practice of paying out compensatory time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| I understand there has been some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| about the trustee's office in light of recent media reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| It is important for you and the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| to know that I am making every effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| to see that both issues are fully addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| My comments today will be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| at the request of the Attorney General's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| They feel that a public airing of details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| regarding the investigation could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| interfere with resolving the matter as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| As soon as I discovered funds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| were missing from the office, I immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| advised the Attorney General's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| and requested that they oversee an investigation of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| appears to be fraud and theft by an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| I have asked them to pursue every suspicious transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| no matter wherever it might lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| I have spent considerable time with the TBI on these matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| and have provided them any and all information and documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| they have asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| We have made many positive changes to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| We've changed the way that we've done things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| And we are going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| This year, we have combined some positions and reduced staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| And we're going to save approximately $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| to these actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| I appreciate the opportunity for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| to allow me to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| Fred, Fred, I just want to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| you've been very well working with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| anything I've asked you for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| And I think you've done a great job in catching this this fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Matter of fact is, I really don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| understand how you caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Well, I was just trying to do my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| And one other thing I'd like to throw in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| we're audited every year by auditors for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| And prior audits didn't see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| And so I take a little bit in pride that I noticed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| But as soon as I did, I brought it to the attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| of the authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| Thank you, Fred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Sheriff JJ, do you want to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| JJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| I think he wanted to talk about the overcrowded lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| if you can come down and sort of update us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| on where we're staying on the lawsuit on the overcrowded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Jimmy Jones, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| A couple of you had asked me about the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| that we are trying to talk about getting dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| And I'm just going to give you a little more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| I think we have a meeting scheduled with a special master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| sometime in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Yes, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| That's all I want to do, just bring you up to date with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| 110, 101, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| Is Ms. Kelly Tipton in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| Kelly Tipton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| This is a resolution honoring Kelly Tipton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| for winning the new Sentinel Knox County Spelling Bee for 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| Read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| Whereas, Kelly Tipton, a 13-year-old seventh grader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| at Holston Middle School, recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5286)|

| 1:28:12| And whereas, Kelly was among 68 elementary and middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| students who participated in the spelling competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| And whereas, the Spelling Bee spanned 13 rounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| with half of the students failing after the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5303)|

| 1:28:51| Bee to be held at the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| And if she prevails at the regional competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| she will be slated to compete at the Scripps National Spelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| Bee in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5340)|

| 1:29:23| Be it further resolved that this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| is to take effect from and after its passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5375)|
| 1:29:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5379)|
| 1:29:39| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5379)|
| 1:29:55| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| I'd like to say that the new Sentinel reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| that Kelly was calm and collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| Her principal and teachers tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| she's a very good student, down to earth, and very, very humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| She doesn't realize why people are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| a big fuss over her winning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| I'd like to congratulate Kelly on a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| And of course, I wouldn't be up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| if it wasn't in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5424)|
| 1:30:34| That's good to have a super catch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5437)|
| 1:30:45| Clark, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5445)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5455)|
| 1:31:04| 501?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| Well, I think it's probably about next anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5473)|
| 1:31:25| Make Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5485)|
| 1:31:38| 907 is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| Mr. Chairman, I pulled 803 off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| You want to do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| In numeric order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| I want to ask that Hillcrest be picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| Go ahead with the Hillcrest piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Yours is short anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| 803 next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| 803 is a resolution adopting the State Open Records Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| public records fee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| Just had a quick question about this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| Voted to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| In order to approve, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| I'm just, Law Director, what are the fees that would be charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| Under the schedule established by the comptroller, it's $0.15 a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| page for 8 1⁄2 by 11, 8 1⁄2 by 14 for black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| $0.50 for the same size copies in color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| Whether or not, if someone requests a duplex, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| charged the same as two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| Search fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| Does it allow search fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| There are fees that can be charged for labor, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| charged on an hourly rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| There's a formula that's provided by the comptroller as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| to how to figure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| It's used at a base pay rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| If you have more than two people working and they're paid at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| different hourly rates, you take the higher rate, subtract an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| hour, and that's where you begin the calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| And what about electronic records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| It doesn't require, when you say electronic records, what do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| Something in a, such as a Word document, a PDF file, an Excel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| file, something like that that could simply be made available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| electronically without printing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| The entity has the discretion at providing it electronically or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| There is no requirement that it be transmitted electronically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| so it's up to the discretion of the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| See, that's the one area where I'd like to see an improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| that is, electronic documents be at the discretion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| requester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Well, the problem with that is it's one thing to provide it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| electronically, but in terms of making them available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| inspection, that's different because you can't give someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| access to view documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| Under the Open Records Act, typically the requester is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| present themselves, and there's no charge to inspect documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| just to duplicate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Well, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| I think we can do better with the electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Maybe just establish a procedure, but I'll do that later in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| some form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| But thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| As the public understands, there's no charge to come in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| view documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| This is just if they want to make copies of documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| So people can do that, and there's no charge for coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| and viewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| Also, the state now has an ombudsperson, and that is their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| responsibility if an individual goes to a place and asks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| records or copies of records, and they must comply with it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| If they don't, you can take that directly to Nashville, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| will intercede on your behalf, any citizen's behalf, who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| getting stonewalled with regards to public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| And my question is, on this, I didn't see where if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| asked for a voluminous amount of copies, are they required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| pay in advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| Can they pay half in advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| Because if you come in and request and then no one picks it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| up, is that – how do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| It's up to the discretion of who's providing, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| providing entity or department can insist on payment in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| And I just want to make sure that was clear, that if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| asks for a lot of documents, they can ask for some payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| We have a motion on the floor for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5753)|

| 1:35:55| This is a resolution requesting the Knox County Purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5755)|

| 1:36:10| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Mr. Chairman, the folks from Hillcrest are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| They have a short presentation they would like to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| commission, and I would ask that we be allowed to view that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| Can we wait until there's a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| I'd like to hear their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| Who's doing the presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| I'm Lee Bell, 1908 Stonehills Place, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| I'm here on behalf of Hillcrest, its patients, its staff, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| thank you for this opportunity to present our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| By profession, I'm a banker, and therefore I'm very well aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| of the serious financial problems facing our country, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| state, and our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| I'm also a volunteer board member of Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| And I have an understanding of the extremely difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| situation they are facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| I'm speaking on behalf of the weakest, the most vulnerable of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| our community, and we need your help in order to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| serve them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| The focus of this presentation are the residents of Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| Our desire is to see that they're taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| We want them taken care of here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| This is their home, and this is where they belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| Hillcrest is a 501C3 not-for-profit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| founded in 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| 560 nursing home beds, 28 assisted living beds, Medicare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| Medicaid certified, and 72% of our population is Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5871)|
| 1:37:59| The board of directors of Hillcrest has endorsed a core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| values statement for decision-making purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| The mission of Hillcrest remains committed to serve, to respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| to preserve the dignity, and to celebrate the lives of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| residents, our families, and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| Hillcrest is deeply concerned about all of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| Everyone matters here at Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| We've adopted some core values for decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| They are the protection and care of our residents, the retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| of employment of the hardworking and dedicated staff of Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| the protection of relationships of Hillcrest business partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| the avoidance of any disruption in service to our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| No board member or officer will have opportunity for monetary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| or personal gain beyond normal business parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| Our primary goal is to protect the residents of Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| We understand the financial dilemma Knox County is facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| Hillcrest, too, is facing a serious financial dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| We are financially weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| We have a poor cash position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| This has been contributed to in part by a census dip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| If you look at the following graph, you'll see that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| October of 08, we had a 90% average occupancy percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| Currently, that is at about 84%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| This has contributed to our weak cash position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| In addition, TennCare has informed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| recently that they're withholding payments totaling $1.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| over an eight-month period. This began in October of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| This further weakens and contributes to our cash position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| Hillcrest has minimal borrowing capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| We have lease insecurities that damage our opportunity to secure a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Some of the demographics of our population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| at Hillcrest, they're residents of Knox County for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| They have a current support system in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| They have been productive citizens and they deserve the very best from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| Over 80% of our population suffers some type of dementia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| 70-80% are females.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| The majority are over 75 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| These are the key characteristics of our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| They average 12-16 ventilator dependent or ventilator weaning patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| We average 25-30 hospice patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| We have a large Medicaid volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| Hillcrest desires a win-win solution for this dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| A win-win for all of us. With appropriate timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| collaboration, cooperation, a mutually beneficial arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| can be found without interruption or displacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| of Hillcrest residents. Our request is simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| and is straightforward to you. We need stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| We need to amend the current lease to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| through June 30, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| We need to revise the termination language to reflect a for-cause only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| termination option, removing the current 60-day option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| Provide the leasee the option to purchase at fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| And we would like to be permitted to sublease our vacant space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| What are the alternatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| Knox County can financially sustain the current operation until a joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| sale of Knox County's property and Hillcrest's nursing home business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| can be sold. If Knox County does nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| or does not approve lease changes, Hillcrest faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| the closure which would displace 500 residents to other facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| across Tennessee as far away as Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| The board has tried hard to be diligent. We've engaged a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| party, Larson Allen Audit Firm, to conduct an independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| assessment of operations and confirmation of our cash position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| We've evaluated partnership and acquisition opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| We have researched the process for an orderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| closing if it becomes necessary. We have required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| the management team of Hillcrest to make improvements, enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| revenue and control expenses, and they have responded very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| Another opportunity stands ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| to engage Hillcrest. Another company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| stands ready to engage Hillcrest in a management agreement, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| they desire a future acquisition of Hillcrest's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| This company has an interest in possible purchase of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| property, and the company would provide an infusion of badly needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| cash. Two independent parties have verified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| that Hillcrest's operation has greatly improved and success is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| not that far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| A partner carefully selected by Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| will give us the opportunity to advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| would allow the current residents to remain at home. This partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| would also present a future opportunity for Knox County to potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| sell the properties in cooperation with a new partner owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| which would be in a better position to make a more substantial cash offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| Our plea, our ask of you, is to please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| make the following lease changes. Extend until June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| 30, 2019 our lease. Eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| the 60-day termination clause, substituting language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| to a standard for-cause termination agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| Provide the leasee the option to purchase at fair market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| and allow for the subleasing of the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| We value this opportunity to present our case to you, and we thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| I do have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| At the last meeting, I guess at our committee meeting, we had asked that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| law director meet with the lawyers for Hillcrest. Has that meeting taken place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| It has. And what are the ramifications of breaking the lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| In other words, could you brief us on your discussions and what you discussed with the lawyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| Well, I was specifically asked to discuss issues regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| the certificate of need and the legal ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| of a sale of the real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| That's all that I was requested to look into, and that's what I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| When you ask about the legal ramifications of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| I think you said breaking the lease? Well, I guess the lease says, as it stands now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| you can do it in 60 days, and there's no... Right. Well, that wouldn't be breaking the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| It provides for a 60-day termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| And if that notice is provided as called for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| under the lease, that would in fact operate to legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| terminate the lease. And what were your discussions with regards to the certificates of need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| Well, the discussions were broad because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| there was no specific question out there other than, as I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| in the context of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| prior discussions, where there had been some interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| expressed in selling the real estate, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| it was my impression that there were various questions by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| commissioners and others about whether or not the certificate of need would in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| be transferred with a sale of the real property. It will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| In fact, any attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| to transfer a certificate of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| is void unless there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| sale of the business itself, a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| of ownership. If there is in fact a change of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| ownership, then the certificate of need can be transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| But a sale of the real property alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| will not affect a transfer of the certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| So what we would be selling then would be the buildings and the land? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| So now, I guess the question then to you is, are these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| certificates of need for sale? Is this something that Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| would look at in terms of if someone were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| get the property and the buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6388)|

| 1:46:40| Hillcrest is in a position at this point in time to look at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| options, and as we've said, we need a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| One of the options that Mr. Bell shared with you would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| joint sale. The problem of real estate by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| county and of the business operations by Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| Our dilemma with that option is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| time that it might take to do that and cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| sustenance until such time that can be done effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| But yes, sir, that is an option that Hillcrest Board would take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| if there were a way to financially sustain the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| through that process. We're looking at probably several months. I mean, we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| six to eight months before any type of sale could take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| Now, this is a tough question, but it needs to be asked. Are these scare tactics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| on your part to try to come in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| affect a vote by this board? Absolutely not. Frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| I wish that it were. It would make my day and my nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| much easier if it were not true, is what I was telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| But I am standing here before you, before God, before my employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| and before my board, many of my residents and my families, to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| that what we've presented is fact. Now, in your presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| you said that if indeed you do have to basically close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| and you said that that could be by March, that a number of these residents would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| be moved. In other words, the state would take over. Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| Yes. We met with the Bureau of TennCare. Since we're 72%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| Medicaid, that was our first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| The Bureau of TennCare, we would write them a letter telling them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| that we needed to close under a voluntary closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| The Bureau would then send some folks on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| and they would guide us through a placement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| As they describe it, they would look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| for beds within Knox County and then they would fan out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| to adjacent counties and so on and so forth. The words that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| the TennCare Director of Long-Term Care shared with me, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| was that many of these residents could go as far west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| as Memphis in that scenario. They have never closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| a 560-bed nursing home in the history of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| When you and I had met, you had mentioned to me that the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| and the medical community were concerned about Hillcrest closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| Yes, sir. We have packets of information for you that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| inclusive of a letter from the three major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| hospital systems. If I might call on Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| Stan Bowling, a representative of the Covenant Health System, he would like to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| that hospital CEO letter with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6568)|
| 1:49:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6576)|

| 1:49:44| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923. It is my honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| on behalf of all the health systems and major health systems in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| County to read a letter that was drafted by all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| CEOs, presidents and CEOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6596)|

| 1:50:04| We are writing to you as representatives of all Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| County's acute care hospitals. We take this action because of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| concern about this item on your agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| Hillcrest Health Care provides services to an underserved population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| of long-term care residents. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| threat of losing this safety net provider in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| community would be devastating to the health care systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| Hillcrest has traditionally accepted a population of patients from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| acute care facilities that other providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| would not have. The ability to discharge these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| patients from our hospitals is imperative. Imperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| to the efficient provision of care for all of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| of the community. Currently our hospitals have very high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| censuses and volumes and the need for efficient and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| effective discharge processes, those for instance to Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| is vital to those awaiting admission through our emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| rooms, outpatient service centers, physician offices and surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| suites. To slow this discharge process for a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| number of patients would be very detrimental to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| Hillcrest has informed us and we agree that to remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| a secure provider of long-term care in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| they need to stabilize their lease to allow them to attract an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| partner and continue their long tradition of filling this very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| important niche in our community's health care system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| And it is signed, Tony Spazia, President and CEO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| Covenant Health, Deborah London, President and CEO Mercy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| Health Partners, and Joe Lansman, President and CEO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| University Health Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| Mr. Chairman, I only have one more question and I know other people want to weigh in on this. One of the options was for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| to basically subsidize Hillcrest until we take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| where we're going. If we put this out for bid, there's really no guarantee that we'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| a bid back that's acceptable and then that just kind of keeps the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| process going, which means more subsidy. It's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| your payroll is $1.4 million a month, is that correct? $700,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| every two weeks? That's correct. So can you give us an idea of over a six-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| period, which I'm quoting the six months because of what we were told in committee, the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| it would take to put this out for bid, maybe even eight months or longer, what kind of subsidy we'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| looking at? Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| until this most recent month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| in which our expense reductions were quite effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| our cash deficit, and I'll ask Danny Higginbotham to correct me if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| wrong, was between $1,000 and $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| per month. We believe that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| straightening out with our most recent moves, but we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| some more time to prove that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| That also would be dependent upon what the census continues to do. Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| if it continues to fall, there would be continued reduction in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| Pinkston? Yes, Mr. Poynter, you're speaking for Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| I am. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| we're going to have to make some hard decisions here. What we're doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| going to not only affect 600 workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| but approximately 500 patients and the 400,000 citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| of Knox County. We need to look at this the best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| to protect everybody. Ms. Poynter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| Hillcrest has made a profit out there for 40-some years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| A non-profit can make a profit. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| A non-profit's revenue over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| expenditures is turned back into the good of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| agency. Yes. That's right. That's what I wanted to get clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| In the year 2000, they had roughly $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| I'm sorry? In the year 2000, they had approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| $30,000 fund balance. We got some new management in out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| and they have run through this money. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| I'm going to ask you some hard questions here. I don't mean to be hard. But in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| 2004, you'd lost money up to this, but 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| was a big loss. $4,692,903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| In 2005, you lost $4,877,553.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| In 2006, you lost $1,535,823.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| Even with those losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| the administration people out there got almost, well, they got over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| a 50% raise. Now, that was not right when you're losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| I don't think. All right. Now, you said in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| paper that you put in cost controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| a little more than a year ago that saved $2.6 million. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| But pulling up your cost sheets, you lost almost $1.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| million. So if you couple that with the savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| that would have been a $4 million loss if you hadn't done it. Why were these cost-saving effects not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| put in sooner, ma'am? Mr. Pinkston, as you and I have talked before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| I have been in place as CEO since late 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| And I can only speak to what activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| that our management team has done in the past 14 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| During that period of time, under only five major initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| and those were administrative salaries with associated benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| the reduction of critical care pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| agency nursing elimination, and overtime reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| this management team, the current management team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| has saved $2.67 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| in 14 months, Mr. Pinkston. I can't speak to what my predecessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| did or what decisions she made at that point in time. Unfortunately, I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| do that. You were the CEO, the second in under her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| were you not, ma'am? COO, I mean, COO. That's chief operating officer, I presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| My title was COO, but during that reign, I spent my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| time as administrator in two of the different facilities due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| vacancies. So I never acted officially in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| traditional role of COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| You stated in the paper that you were $1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| million down in revenue being held behind. Is that not a one-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| incident, ma'am, at $150,000 a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| After the first month, you should be right on target with your line. Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| You're not being restricted to $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| The Bureau of TennCare has reduced our payments for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| period of eight months at almost $150,000 for a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| of $1.2 million out of our cash flow across eight months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| beginning October 2008. Is that not at $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| a month? It's $147,000 to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| Are they reducing the other nursing? Yes, that is due to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| change in the reimbursement system, but that still impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| cash. But the way I'm reading this article here is they're only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| holding you back a month. Instead of paying you in the front, now they're paying you in the rears. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| That will be part of the new system. That's what you're talking about, the $147,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| After the $1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| million, which is a typical one month's Medicaid check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| after the $1.2 million is withheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| in January 2002, the reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| structure, 2010, excuse me, the reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| method will change to a bill for services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| methodology. They're withholding cash now to get us on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| even playing field for that date. What you're telling me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| they're holding $150,000 every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| for eight months, and that's cutting your revenue down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| That's cutting my cash, yes, sir. Well, now let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| How are these other nursing homes that take Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| and Medicare patients, and they pay taxes on their profit, they pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| taxes on their land, and according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| the state now, 66%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| of all nursing home patients are Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| and Medicare. Now, that's all. That's even the ones that are in for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| So that means that they also, these profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| ones that take Medicare and Medicare, that means there could possibly be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| than 66% in their homes just like yours. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| To get an average, yes, you would have some higher and some lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| Well, they're making it out there in these tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| times. They've made it for seven or eight years where y'all have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| losing money for seven or eight years, and like I say, they're paying taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| and they're paying property taxes even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| On another thing here, you said in this article in the paper here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| that your business had fallen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| dramatically since this came up in November. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| Was the West facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| suspended for taking patients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| Last May, and that was corrected within 20 days, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| Is Hillcrest North on the watch list now? No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| When did they come off? Hillcrest North has never been on the watch list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| Well, it's on the Internet. They put it on 12-19. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| 12-19? Hillcrest North? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| According to the Internet, Hillcrest North is. They were put on at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| 12-19-08. I haven't received that correspondence, so if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| get it, I'll confirm that statement for you. All right. In reading this article and pulling up your cost sheets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| you're talking about how much your business is down? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| On your cost sheet, sir, where you lost $1,500,000, almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| $1,600,000, you've got on it that you were stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| 85 percent capacity. Is that correct? Which documents are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| Your cost sheets for 2008. Cost reports. Yes, ma'am. I'll have to ask Danny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| to confirm that, since he's the controller. I don't have those documents in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| Is he here? Danny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| I don't have the cost report with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| I need your name and address, sir. Oh, I'm sorry. Danny Higginbotham, 124 Huntington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| Lane, Haskell, 37754.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| I believe that the way I read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| that, you stated you were at 85 percent capacity. That means out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| 560 beds, you've got 476| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| residents. Probably during that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| period of time, that sounds about right. All right, sir. Right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| that time meant you had 84 beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| empty. Correct. Well, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| you're just 89, according to your paper, according to what was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| the paper. That's only 5 beds more. So business isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| down that much, really. Well, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| depends on how you look at it. When you're already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| losing money during that year, and then you go down another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| 5 beds, and then you lose $150,000 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| then you very quickly run out of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| Ms. Poynter, are you familiar with the standing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| nursing homes, admission, discharges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| and transfers? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| 1200-8-6-.05| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| When an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| involuntary transfer is proposed in addition to any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| relevant factors, the following factors shall be taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| The traumatic effect on the resident, the proximity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| the proposed nursing home to the present nursing home and to the family and friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| of the resident. The availability of necessary medical and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| social services at the proposed nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| Compliance by the proposed nursing home with all applicable federal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| state regulations. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| what I'm getting to is emergency medical due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| resident inmate, need for a higher level care, no involuntary transfer or discharge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| will be made until five business days after these agencies have been notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| unless they each earlier declare that they have no intention of intervening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| Now, what I'm getting at here is we're talking about sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| these people all over the state. Now, like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| con, this certificate of need, the state's not going to let anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| have it. Right here, except when the board has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| revoked or suspended the license, a nursing home which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| stands too close, cease doing business or reduce its license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| bed capacity by 10% or more shall notify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7398)|
| 2:03:22| both the department and the area long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| of Budsman at the earliest moment of the decision, but not later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| than 30 days before the action is to be implemented. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| facility shall establish a protocol subject to the department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| approval for the transfer or discharge of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| residents. Should the nursing home violate the provisions of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| paragraph, the department shall request the Attorney General of the State of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| Tennessee to intervene to protect the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| as is provided by TCA 68-11-213.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7434)|
| 2:04:00| Now, that says except when the board has revoked or suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| the license. So I believe that they would give someone if they bought this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| con in reading this. That's the way I interpret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| That would be their decision to make. I mean, it says to protect the patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| What kind of plan have you got on subleasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| these buildings you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| Which buildings are those? Most people here on county commission don't realize it, but there's five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| facilities that you have. Instead of three, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| five. Well, there's two buildings on the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| campus. The old TB hospital, as most people know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| and it does not house residents at this point. Oh, I don't mean to have residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| What is the Weaver? Is that the Weaver? The Weaver building is what we refer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| as the corporate old TB hospital. All right. What is Lakebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| Lakebrook is the newer building on the west campus that's attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| to the original Hillcrest West building. The bottom floor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| the Lakebrook building contains our assisted living, and the top floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| contains our orthopedic rehab program. Is that assisted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| living for pay? Yes. Is it profit? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| It's not for profit. It goes back into Hillcrest. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| But what kind of needs are you going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| lease these buildings for? What are they going to be used for when you lease them to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| In the fall, when we had hoped to become property owners, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| talked to one particular partner, a service partner that we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| utilize, who, for example, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| sub-leases or leases space in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| for warehousing equipment. That would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| one potential opportunity for us to sub-lease to them, which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| a benefit to them and to us. And the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7552)|
| 2:05:56| entity that we talked to was one of the area hospitals around an outpatient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| dialysis center in our corporate building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| whereas we could cohort all of our current nursing home dialysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| patients on the north campus and simply bring them across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| a breezeway and up an elevator to get their dialysis three times a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| rather than loading them in an ambulance and hauling them across town three times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| Commissioner Pixton, I'm going to let you ask one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| question. I'm going to get these other lights and come back to you. That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| You can go ahead to them then, as long as you come back to me. I've got several more questions here I want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7592)|
| 2:06:36| Yeah, I hope we can put this to bed today. Lee Bell, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| was a great presentation that you made. A really fresh face, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| did a good job with that. A question that I had, Ms. Porrent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| talking about the lease, just so I can be clear in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| you're looking possibly at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| going in with somebody else to go in with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| and then if that happens, you still would not have that lease for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| that ten-year period. If you go in with somebody, then you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| go ahead and take the option to buy the property or move on somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| If you move in with somebody, you're just not going to be paying a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| a year. The potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| partner that we've spoken with, frankly, who is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| preferential partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| has given us three options that our board will study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| The first step in our relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| which first priority is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| infuse cash and stabilize the business, would be that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| would, on the Hillcrest operations side, engage this company under a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| management agreement, whereby they would infuse cash and help us continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| to implement our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| A second option that these folks have spoken with us about is an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| in at least two of the properties, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| West and South. And so it might be that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| could bring them in under a management agreement and then come back to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| together in some period of time to then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| propose at a fair market value a purchase of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| at least some of the properties, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| would help the county from a cash perspective and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| keep the business moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| I just want to show for the people at home, let them know that Knox County will still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| have the buildings somewhere down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| Yes. And with what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| Mr. Chairman, I'm ready to make a motion, but I'll let other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| speak that want to speak on issues. Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7728)|
| 2:08:56| You know, first I want to applaud Moxley Carmichael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| They are a wonderful public relations firm and great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| lobbyist and they've done a really good job of putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| this presentation together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| You know, it's amazing. Just a few months ago you were ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| buy this property and you wanted to buy this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| Times were good. Things were going great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| Or at least that's the picture that your PR firm showed us then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| Now things are so devastatingly bad that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| well, if we don't extend this lease, then it's just going to collapse and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| the sky's just going to fall in. I think the truth lies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| somewhere in the middle. I know that when you hire a PR firm and when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7780)|
| 2:09:44| put on a presentation, you're trying to influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| the public to support a certain position and you're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| influence this commission to support a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| I think you're in the same shape then as you were now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| And I think that what this is about, it's about exactly the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| thing that it was about a few months ago. I think you all want to buy this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| facility and I think you probably have a partner ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| I just told Mr. Smith that you all would put something together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| and come back to buy it at fair market value, but I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| you want to determine fair market value rather than it go through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| fair bidding process. Ma'am, this is government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| We can't sell to one person. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| sell something, it has to go through a fair and open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| and transparent bidding process. I'm not going to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| extending this lease with the knowledge that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| going to come back and want to buy the property again in the future because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| we're going to wind up exactly in the same place we were a few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| ago. We're a government. Now maybe this government has operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| on the good old boy system where buddies got in the back room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| and cut deals to a preferential company and your company is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| a preferential company. You've taken very good care of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| citizens of this county. The problem is that we're a government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| We can't sell to one person. It has to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| through a bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| The way I see it, we can do one of two things. We can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7880)|
| 2:11:24| to run on the lease that we're operating on and I can understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| you wanting a little more stability and do away with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| the 60 day termination clause within that lease. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| could understand you wanting a little more security than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| But the thing is we're at the same point. We've either got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| sell these facilities to a business, hopefully yours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| would be the high bidder, or we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| continue leasing this. We can't keep playing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| games where we're going to come back in a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| months down the road with our new partners and make a fair market offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| because I'll say the exact same thing then if I'm still on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| commission. I'm going to say a fair market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| will only be determined through the bidding process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| and the RFP process and you're still going to have to go up against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| competitors in that process. We cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| sell it just to you. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| that's what you're trying to do here. You're trying to buy some time to put a package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| together and I'm telling you that I may support doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| away with the 60 day clause. I haven't made up my mind yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| But there is no way I'm going to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| selling this without a fair and open RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| where other companies have the ability to bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| And I don't think you're in the kind of trouble that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| presented. In any picture there's shadows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| and there's light. And you can make it say anything you want to depending on whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| angle that you look at it from. But if you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| in the kind of trouble that you say you're in, you couldn't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| Moxley Carmichael representing you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| May I respond to a couple of those? Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| I failed to say to Mr. Smith's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| the third option from this company is an ongoing lease for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| buildings. It is not our partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| with this company is not contingent on purchasing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| We would only do that if the county commission thought that was a win-win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| situation. And they understand that if it goes to a purchase that it will be through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| a fair and open and transparent bidding process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| competitors could bid on that as well. This company nor any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| others, and I've talked to many across the country, will not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| consider a partnership with us until I have a stable lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| So if we walk out today without a stable lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| and with no financial support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| regardless of your skepticism of me telling the truth, Mr. Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| I'm not saying you're not telling the truth. Let me say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| cash is king and when it's gone, payroll isn't met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| and residents are gone. I can't wait until I'm cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| depleted to give the Bureau of TennCare notice because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| it is my moral obligation to ensure these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| are kept safely somewhere. And if it's not in Hillcrest facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| in Knox County, I will see that they have a place to reside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| before Hillcrest runs out of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| But if your company went under, we could sell those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| buildings to someone else and the patients would never need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| moved. Only if that could happen before I was cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| depleted. My problem is when cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8096)|
| 2:15:00| I can't wait until cash is gone to move residents. When I move residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| you have empty buildings, Mr. Lambert, for what you can sell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| for anything you want at that point. Well, if you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| you're in that kind of trouble, then why don't you put the licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| in with the buildings and you and your partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| company bid on it in a fair and I would hope that you all would get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| I have no problem with Hillcrest. What I have a problem with is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| that it seems like we keep wanting to do this without a fair and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| open bidding process. Now, what would stop you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| from putting your licenses up for sale with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| property and then you and your partner company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8140)|
| 2:15:44| bidding on it like everybody else? Because in that scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| in that scenario, ma'am, you all keep saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| any other company that would bid on it would not have the licenses for the beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| therefore the people would be moved. Ma'am, if those licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| for the beds were not put as a part of the deal, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| your company that would be putting the people on the street by not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| allowing those licenses to go with the facility and you could easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| if you're in that kind of trouble, you could easily say we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| combine the licenses with the county's property and then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| your non-profit and the company you want to partner with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| could bid on it with everyone else that would bid on it. Mr. Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| within Mr. Bell's presentation, that option was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| We have said we will combine the licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| with the real estate to go through a sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| process cooperatively and professionally with the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| However, the time frame is the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| and there will have to be financial support from either Knox County or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| some God-given gift to maintain the business until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8212)|
| 2:16:56| such time that dual sale could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| Commissioner Luther. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| The last thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| that we can allow is the closure of Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| If we're going to sell the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| they have offered to sell the CONs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| and the business, but they're asking for financial support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| until we can get to the closing table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| That's one option. If we wish to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| sell the facilities to get our cash out of it, to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| of the health care facility business, then that's what we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| to do. We need to step up and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| that Hillcrest stays viable until the date of the closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| Or we need to somehow come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| together and renegotiate the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| I have questions about that. This business of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| able to sublease the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| The partnership. Where does Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| come into that equation? Do we get to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| any input into who that partnership is? Because we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| about not just your residents, but the residents of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| that we need to be assured of that will continue to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| cared of. Plus, they're the ones that are going to be helping operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| I also feel that if we're going to extend this and allow the subleasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| of the buildings, or some buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| then I think the lease payment needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| altered as well. I don't believe that you're going to be getting a partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| in here, someone who's going to infuse millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| they're going to expect some type of return, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| to allow them to come in and continue to pay a dollar a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8336)|
| 2:19:00| I don't think that's very fair to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| The most important thing is to make sure we take care of these residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| That's the most important thing. The second thing we need to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| is Knox County financially. Because we have a duty to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| that whatever we do here, we still have a financial obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| to the rest of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| I'm here today to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| the decisions that Knox County decides to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| I haven't made my mind up of these two options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| but we're going to have to do something today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| I think, to assure the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| and assure the employees that business will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| to go on. But I do think if we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| to go down the road of renegotiating the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| then we need to renegotiate the lease payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| Thank you. I would like to start off by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| thanking you, Ms. Poynter, and the services that Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| has given our community. And we as a government talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| many times about taking care of a lot of social issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| in Knox County, from a 10-year plan to eliminate the homeless to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8422)|
| 2:20:26| all other things. And we're coming face-to-face today with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| the complex problem of how we're going to take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| my grandmother and my mother and my neighbors and your neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| who are not able to take care of themselves, and people in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| who have paid taxes, who have lived in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| who have helped build this community over the years, and now because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| maybe Knox County is going to face some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| financial difficulties. We haven't seen a budget yet for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| We don't even know how bad it is. We're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| about throwing my community's former leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| and former citizens to the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| It really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| I'm not one who hasn't made up their mind as to what we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| for the citizens of Knox County. And I know a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| people from the 8th District that you serve and that you care for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| And I've heard from the people of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| And I think we as a government need to step up a minute. We have a moral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| obligation to our citizens. And I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| talking about Hillcrest, per se. But we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| that we need to take care of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| I think we're worried too much about the money of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8510)|
| 2:21:54| or we're worried about the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| I really think more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| than anything that we as a community can solve these kind of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| I don't think that we're locked in to where we have to sell anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8530)|
| 2:22:14| If we are, I mean, I haven't seen the budget yet or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| proposals for next year. And if we're in that bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| shape, then I'm really concerned whether we're going to have to call the state and see if we can sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| the veterans home. Or next year we're going to have to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| our senior citizen centers. Or the next year we're going to have to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| the city county building just so that we can operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8554)|
| 2:22:38| our government here. Selling of assets is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| a very serious thing. And I think we've been in partnership to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8562)|
| 2:22:46| our senior citizens and our community for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| I hate to see that partnership go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| I'm not saying that Hillcrest may have not had some problems in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| I'm not saying that Hillcrest will not have problems in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| Knox County has had problems in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8582)|
| 2:23:06| And I'm not saying we won't have problems in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8586)|
| 2:23:10| But I think that we're all smart enough and I think that we're all strong enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8590)|
| 2:23:14| to put our hands together and deal with our problems collectively as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| I personally believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| that we need to support Hillcrest in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| I personally believe that sometimes we're part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| Since I came on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| this came up first out of the bag. And my first question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| was, I wonder why we have to sell our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| to operate our government. Nobody's answered that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| for me since I've been here. Nobody. Anywhere. Anyplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| Number two, why do I have to pick the property where it's going to throw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| my grandmother and your grandmother potentially out on the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| Now, we can argue the fine points whether we will or whether we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| Well, I'm sorry. If I'm arguing fine points about things I don't know anything about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| I'm going to err on the side that I'm not going to throw my grandparents out on the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| Now, the rest of us can take chances if you want to and try to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| the lawyer and interpret the law the best that fits our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| But right now, it looks like we don't own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8658)|
| 2:24:22| anything other than property. And we cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| get, quote, $22 million for property and a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| that we don't own. Now, we can argue about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| all day long, but all we own is some real estate and we don't even know what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| Yet. We're way premature in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| situation. Now, back to the point. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| partner here who's having a tough situation. Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| is having a tough situation. We don't have any money. And we're going to have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8690)|
| 2:24:54| some tough decisions. And we're just going to have to own up to it. We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| it to make. I think this commission is capable of making them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| However, I would ask this commission not to throw our indigent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| and our elderly and our citizens to the curb in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| We're not being asked for much. We're being asked for an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| and a lease. We're being asked for a cause of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| termination. We can debate whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| how fair market value is determined or even options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8722)|
