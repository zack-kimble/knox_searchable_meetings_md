| 0:00:00| I just wanted to make sure that before we went any further, that was a question I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| in my mind, because like I said, that's the last thing I want is to end up in court after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5)|
| 0:00:13| we go through the process of trying to point these folks to these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=13)|
| 0:00:21| Just to end up with a possible legal question that I don't think anybody here in this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=21)|
| 0:00:27| audience or probably in Knox County would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=27)|
| 0:00:30| So it's your opinion that filled means not only appointed, but also sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=38)|
| 0:00:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| Okay, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=40)|
| 0:00:41| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| Mr. Chairman, I have a substitute motion I'd like to put on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=43)|
| 0:00:49| I'll make a motion for a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| Agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| I'd like to pass these out if I might, Jolie or someone, if you would pass these out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=53)|
| 0:01:00| my fellow Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=60)|
| 0:01:02| While she's passing those out, let me say that one of the things I learned as we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| gone through these last few weeks and months, it is important how we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| It's also important that people understand why you vote the way you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| I have a substitute motion, and I think it's important that the citizens I represent understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| why I'm proposing what I'm proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| I've talked with a lot of citizens over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| I've listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| I listened to my colleagues last Monday when we had our Commission workshops, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| tried to do a lot of my homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| As of last night, 93 people have picked up petitions to run for the county positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| on February the 5th, and I understand that there were more today, so we could have well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| over 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| That doesn't mean they're all going to run, but it means that these people have picked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| up petitions and they are thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| They will need to return that to become a qualified candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| After today, we have 56 days until early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| Now, frankly, that's not a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| We're looking at Thanksgiving this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| We're looking at Christmas holidays coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| I believe that these 93 people, and as I said, there could be more, should have the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| to present their ideas to the community and let the citizens vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| We had talk of a straw poll at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Well, if the people vote, that's about the ultimate poll that you could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| Already we have forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| We were invited to one just the other night, and I wasn't able to go because of another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| People are already putting up signs, they're knocking on doors, they're raising money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| I say, let's let this process work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Under the proposal that we have, December the 7th would be the day for the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| As I do my math, that's only 38 days until early voting begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| My motion is this, that we begin receiving resumes on February the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| All resumes would go to the commission office, although persons could send them to us directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| February 11th, which is a Monday, we meet to accept these resumes, make sure that each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| person on commission has the information needed to study, and then we begin forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| Forums would be February 12th, 13th, 15th, and 2 on February the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| February 16th is a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| One would be at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| The other one would be at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| I did not put February 14th because that's Valentine's Day, and I thought maybe some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| of us would have plans on Valentine's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| Do you have plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| My wife's watching, so yes, we do have plans on Valentine's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| February 19th is our regular commission workshop day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| Incorporate that as our final public hearing for anyone wishing to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| February 20th, the next day, we meet, we do the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| We go on record as saying no one is sworn in early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| I believe that this process would be clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| The appointees would be sworn in later that day at a set time on February the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| There's no perfect way to do this, and we're going to be criticized, I'm going to be criticized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| regardless of what happens, but the Chancellor said that we need to have public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| He said substantial reconsideration of the appointments, and I believe that this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Now, this does not mean that once we get the results of the February 5th election that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| we would be bound by anything that is done in that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| This would be mainly as information for us because the people would have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| to have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| And as I mentioned, all of the people that I've talked with, who have talked to me, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| been overwhelming, they want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| And so, there have been people who have asked that we go ahead with the appointments, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| I respect those opinions, but I believe that the sentiment in our community is vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| And given the time frame of just 56 days from tomorrow, 38 days from the December 7th date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| which is on here, that we can wait and go through that voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Now, there are those who may not wish to seek the appointment if they do win the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| because there are those who would say, well, I don't want to be known as the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Appointment, I want to be known as the People's Appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| So it kind of goes both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| So that is my motion, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Okay, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| Commissioner Hammond, a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| On the forums, you've got the 12th, 13th, 15th, and then two on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=309)|
| 0:05:18| That's five forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| I throw that out for consideration, there could be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| And I mention Saturday because, you know, as we move into it, move into it, but Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| seems to be a time where people have opportunities to come and be a part of things, and it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| seem to me at 9 a.m., do one forum, 2 p.m. on another, and again, I just throw that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| I was just trying to go through, you have, we have nine districts, you've proposed five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=339)|
| 0:05:48| forums, and I guess my question is, are you wanting to possibly combine, like, maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| couple of the districts together, is that your idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| Do you have a plan as far as that's concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Yes, my idea was to have a forum for the 1st and 2nd districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| You would have a forum which would have the 4th district candidates, one which would feature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| the 5th and 6th, and one which would feature the 8th and 9th candidates, again, for county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Then we would have one forum that would be basically for the elected officials, the countywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Now, the countywide people could be incorporated into those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| That means they would have to come to five forums, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| I was sort of looking at it, and you look at these districts geographically, I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| see the 1st and 2nd being a combined meeting, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, although the 3rd doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=393)|
| 0:06:42| have a vacancy, but I think somewhere in the Cedar Bluff area is sort of like a central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| location for those three districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| You could easily have a combined 6th and 7th district, although the 7th district doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| have a vacancy, and then the 8th and 9th districts could find maybe a common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=416)|
| 0:07:05| And I just throw that out there as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| You could have the countywides at all four of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| You could have a 5th where the countywides, where we just talk about countywides only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=436)|
| 0:07:24| I was just trying to think of trying to combine some of those meetings up so that we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=444)|
| 0:07:33| so when people show up to that, they can hear more than just one district candidate or candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| for one district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| And those folks that would like to attend all of them, and instead of having to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| to attend 9, maybe attend 4 or 5, and I was just trying to see what kind of guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| you were trying to do with each of these different evenings and the two on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| So your intent was to maybe combine some of these together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Okay, I'd just like to add something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| Senator Hammond, what do you think after February, after the election, and we're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| two-party system, Republican, Democrats, how do you see just voting for the best person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=500)|
| 0:08:28| to fulfill that term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| This would be an opportunity for us to let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| We could take that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| That would not be the only consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| It would be a consideration, but it would give them an opportunity to vote on the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| and we could take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Okay, I think we have some elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| I don't know if any of them want to speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| If there's anybody, elected official, okay, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=528)|
| 0:08:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Like the rest of you, I don't want to make these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| I don't want this responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| It's a difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| It's a hard thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| But when I ran for public office, I knew that there would be difficult and hard decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| that I would have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Now, Mr. Hammond, with your proposal, you're talking putting this off another two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| The Attorney General has already spoken, and he said he needs a sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Not an acting sheriff, but he needs a sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| This community, what we have here in Knox County, it's a provisional government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| All the people are not represented equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| Some of the people are not represented at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Some districts are fully represented, which means they're overrepresented on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| at this time in comparison to their neighbors in other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| The people of the fourth district have no representation whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| The people of my district, the sixth district, have half the representation that they normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| And what you're proposing is putting this off two more months, having two more meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| of decisions that affect the people's lives in this county by a legislative body that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| is not a complete legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Now, I would like to have the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| I wish I had a time machine and could tell who was going to win these primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| I would love to have that information when we make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| But the truth is, we don't have that information now, and we need to fill these positions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| We need to fill this legislative body now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| We need to fill these county-wide offices now, because right now we are running way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| short in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| We are running with temporaries, folks in these county-wide offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| And as difficult as it is, we need to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| And I think our job is to make these appointments in a timely manner, but in a manner that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| for a significant reconsideration and allows for significant public debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| Now I believe we have another proposal that allows for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| And I believe that if we vote for this proposal to put this off two more months, to have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| more meetings without full representation, I believe that we are neglecting our duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| and we are putting it off because we don't want to make the tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| Well, I, for one, I don't want to make the tough decisions, but I'm willing to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| I'm willing to do my job and proceed with this appointment process in an open and transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| And I believe that putting it off is just an attempt to try to put off the inevitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| to put off doing our duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| You know, I'm looking at this, there's a lot of good ideas here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| You know, I'm concerned about the Fourth District is not represented too, but you know, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| not like the Fourth District is four to six hundred miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| I mean, it's just a mile down the street here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| I cross it several times throughout the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| You other commissioners do the same thing, coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| We're all Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| You know, we're not just the Seventh District or the Ninth District, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| Which comes from a man whose district is fully represented, or should I say overrepresented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| at this time, because you have both of your representatives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| You know, there is no right way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| I can make decisions, I don't care to go back and do the homework and go back and interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| people, but I like the thing I like the most about this is this weeds out a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| It weeds out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Say the Fourth District's got nine people running, and you've got five Democrats and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| five Republicans that are running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| And if we happen to pick the fifth place Republican that got the very lowest thing, I'd rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| the people tell us who they want, and then we'll decide between the top vote getters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| It may not be that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| And I'm still talking, Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| You know, there's no right way, but I think this is a very fair way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| Knox County is still moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| It's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Hang on, Commissioner Lambert, let's go to Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| To answer one of Commissioner Smith's problems there, he's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| We are Knox County, but we represent a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| Who would want someone in Memphis appointing Jimmy Duncan's successor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| We have one man, one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Now, what I find wrong with Commissioner Hammond's thing here is we're throwing these districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Where are we going to have these meetings at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| We think that every district should have the meeting for their representative in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| And you commissioners should come to each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| We've got nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| So what I'm saying is I don't like the ninth district being thrown in with the eighth or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| seventh and people from the eighth or seventh district coming down and talking and influencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| you somehow to vote for our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| This is still one man, one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| And that's the way I want it to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| Now, if we're going to have these in February, Mr. Hammond, before I'll go along with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| it'll have to be nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| But I really feel like that we need to make these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| Now, as far as when the people are sworn in, if they want to sit down and get sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| our job is to make the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| If they want to sit down and be sworn in immediately, the law director says they can, well, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| just going to kill them in the election if they run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| So we need to do our job and make our appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| It seems to me like everybody up here is shirking their responsibility on what to do but trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| to come up with a way that goes against the way it's supposed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| It's supposed to be done, we're supposed to make the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Now, you've heard everybody say, well, there's so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| There's only one in my district, one commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| There's two in the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| There's nothing really unusual about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| These are countywide districts, everybody's going to get to vote on them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| So I still think that you should listen to the people, the commissioner in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| because he is a representative, he was elected, and he should know what his constituents want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| But I'm for going ahead with these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| And if the guy wants to come in and sit down and be sworn in after we appoint him, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| we should say that we recommend they don't be sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| But if he wants to be sworn in, he's taking a chance to come in February in the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| that he's going to be beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| It's up to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| I'd like to just speak against the, I guess, substitute motion, is it a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=964)|
| 0:16:12| You know, like everyone here says, you know, they don't want to have to make the appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| but it is the legislative body, and I think we all ran and said that we could do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| And I think starting with what we talked about last week, starting November 26th, and having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| through December 6th a meeting in every district of Knox County, beginning at 7 p.m. each night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=989)|
| 0:16:38| and give the candidates 10 minutes to speak, and countywide officers 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| I've talked to the news director at Channel 10, and they would broadcast it live every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| single night, and have talked to community television, and they'd replay it on CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| We make the appointments on December 7th at 8 a.m., giving people another opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| And then after that, we make the appointments, because on December, I think, the 10th, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| Monday is our next committee meeting, and the following Monday is our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| And I think, you know, it's our job to make these appointments, and I don't think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| to wait until after an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Let me just remind you, just a few months ago, the governor of Tennessee didn't wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| until the next election to replace a criminal court judge in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| He had someone sitting in his place, being a caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| But then he made a real appointment to that criminal court seat in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| So I don't think the governor of Tennessee said, well, I might ought to wait until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Let's see what the people say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| It's his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| He said he could be governor of Tennessee, and with that, he had the authority to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| so, just like we have the authority to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| And we've made some appointments on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| We've made some people's won elections, and we've appointed people that's lost the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| To me, that doesn't matter to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| Our job is to appoint somebody to fill this seat, to do the job of the people until this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Now, the attorney general in Knox County said that we need a sheriff, and we need, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| in some of the other offices, we need real office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| We've got a budget coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| The mayor's going to want their budget in February, March, probably, January, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| And the people who are in there serving are serving right now as chief deputies at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| pleasure of the people we appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| So I think the commission, I respect the commission, but I think it's time, like I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| we need to quit ducking our head and tucking our tail and running out and saying we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| want to do nothing because we're afraid we're going to get our feelings hurt or we'll hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| somebody's feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| You know, we need to do it as openly and as transparent as we can, and like I said, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| no perfect process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| But for us to sit here and do nothing, I think it's a disgrace to say you want to be a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| commissioner and then not do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Did you have a date on the forms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Yes, I passed out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| You should all have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| So Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| You know, if I brought the proposal forward today that we just not do anything, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| not have any commission meetings, that we wait until this body is filled after according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| to Mr. Hammond's plan, you would think it was the most ridiculous thing you ever heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| But that's exactly what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| And actually it would make more sense just not to have commission meetings and not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| make decisions until this county is fully represented than to neglect their duty and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| go two more months with countywide offices not being legitimately filled with a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| person and with commission sites being vacant and with their representation being as lopsided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Like I said before, we have commission districts that are unrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| We have commission districts that are fully represented and we have commission districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| that are partially represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| This is not the legislative body that it was designed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| And I believe that we need to turn this back into the legislative body that the formers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| of our charter designed for it to be a 19-member commission as quickly as possible, but in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| an open and transparent manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| Commissioner, I don't know who's, Commissioner Lutheran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| There were other lights on and I'd yield to any of them, but I want to say if you'll yield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| I'll yield the floor to you, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| It seems to me like that we've got some commissioners here representing some districts who are trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| to seize power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Yeah, and I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| The 5th District normally has one-third more representation than the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| I have two, there are two commissioners in the 6th District, three in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| Right now, the 5th District has twice the representation of the people of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| That's how lopsided this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Mr. Chairman, I'm prepared if I yielded the floor to Commissioner Pinkston, I'll take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| it back now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| First of all, Commissioner Lambert, we have three commissioners in the 5th District because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| we're 50% larger than the other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| And now you have 100% more representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| It is still one man, one vote like you've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| Whereas according to the last census, the other eight districts had approximately 40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| residents, the 5th District had 60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| So, we do represent the same number of people per commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| Just to make that clear that if there was a question out there, why the 5th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| had an extra commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| I'm sorry you guys feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| I don't feel that by waiting until February is neglecting our responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| I've heard from many folks, some wanting us to wait until February, some of us to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:39| ahead and make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| And it's a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| And that's why we're here, to make a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| But I have heard more in favor of us waiting than I have wanting to go ahead and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| I've heard that some of the responses I've had is that they feel like we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| rush again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| And that's the last thing that I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| I understand that probably no matter what we do, there's going to be people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| going to be against whatever we do, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| But I do think allowing for at least the primaries to go through and to not to hamper the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:25| election process that has already started, and to give the people a chance to have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| say before we have our say, I think that's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:40| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| I would just add to what Commissioner Leuthold said, that it's not really a question of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| not doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| It's a question of when we do our job and armed with what information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| The process that he has outlined, I think, will give us that better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| And I don't think really the matter of meetings should get in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| If Commissioner Pinkston wants to do something exclusively in his district, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| If Commissioner Tank Strickland and I wish to have an event at Austinese that combines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| first and second district, I'm sure we can talk that out at a public meeting and that'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| work out nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| We have the opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| There's genuine disagreement, but let us hope that we do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| And I think doing it on this timeline, as Commissioner Smith said, nothing is perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| but this probably makes the most sense of all we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| You know, I'm going back in policy to what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| I'm making pretty much solely my decision is being made on what people have told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| and other commissioners have mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| We've had this, we've been talking about this now for a month, two months, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| But it's probably, from what I hear, and I'm around a lot of people every day, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| probably 95% from just what I hear, Paul, and what you're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| But from what I'm hearing, 95% say let's go ahead and let's wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| I mean, if they say let's do it today, fine, I can do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| But my gut tells me and what I'm hearing, and that's what I'm making my decision on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| is everybody else is saying let's wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| I don't know who you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| I just got a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| When do we redistrict the next time we redistrict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| After the 2010 census?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| After 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Every ten years when the census is done, we're required by state law to, if not federal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:36| by the charter to redistrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| I think that these districts should be cut up to where they come in and serve so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| people in the city and so many in the county, because after all, we do represent the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| people, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| And then that way, no one district would have the votes that the West has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| They would have to come in, they'd be split up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Well, Commissioner, we're still talking about one man, one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| I understand we're talking about one man, one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| And you still have to have the same number of representatives per voter out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| Now, you can divide the districts up any way you want, but it still has to come, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| are certain state laws that you have to fall within so that you have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| I know all about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| But what I'm saying is it looks to me like, when you get right down to it, that the West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| outnumbers the South and the East and everything like that, the way it comes in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| Basically, if you want to take the fourth district and the fifth district, they've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| five votes to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| And you can be for anything down West and get it through practically and be against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| something in South Knoxville or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| I just think we need to start representing everybody in the city and the county instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| of having just totally city districts and total county districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| I've received a lot of phone calls both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| Obviously, there's a lot of strong opinion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| I don't know if we could do this, this is sort of a little bit of a compromise, is if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| we followed Scott's outline and ended on three or seven on the last day, it would be a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| meeting and I don't see any reason that we couldn't go ahead and take care of the countywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| And then also, however we have to word it and or, to go forward the next day or to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:37| over to Mr. Hammond's plan to, I guess, jump it over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| We've heard the people and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| We'll see the slate of candidates that come out if we've got a good slate, if it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| a good slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| But are there any reason that we couldn't take care of the four countywide offices on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| that particular day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| That seems like that would end some of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| On what day are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Well, it would be on December 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| So Commissioner Ballard, what you're saying is to go ahead and appoint the four countywides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| and then on, but as far as commission, you're saying wait on those until...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| Not necessarily wait, that we would then on that day decide to either devote the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| day on the 7th, I guess, or whatever day that Scott had, or move it forward, or go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| forward with Mike Hammond's motion as he has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| Well, you have to go ahead, you have to give 10 days notice, and I may not be understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| what you're saying, Commissioner, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| But you have to give 10 days notice to fill a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| We're either going to have to decide what day we're going to make the appointments in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| So I would hate to start down a process and then the day before decide to not make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| appointments the next day, if I'm understanding what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Okay, well, let's take it one step at a time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Let's only talk about the four countywides, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| We've gave enough notice and that can end December 6th, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| If that's what this body chooses to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| And are there any way that we can word it today, even if you word it today, to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| it until February, you're going to have more than 10 days notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:40| I still don't understand what you're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| I think that we need to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Well, what I'm trying to accomplish is I'd like to see who would show up and if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| a full slate of candidates and that our selection...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| I guess what you're saying is let's see what we have by a certain date and then if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| like what we see, we can just say, well, we're not going to vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| We'll vote in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| Well, first of all, back again, I'd like to take care of the four countywides by December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| 6th or 7th, however that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| If you end it with 3 and 7, that would be a short meeting, District 3 or District 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| that would be a short meeting and we could put those people in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| I'm still not following you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| If we go ahead with your plan...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| You have this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| We can forget the eight commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| So you're not talking about having forms in all nine districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| I'm having that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Well, if we do that, why wouldn't we just go ahead and have the commission candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| come out the same night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Because then we're saying the office holders are more important than commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| Well, no, I'm not saying that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Well, that's what you're saying by saying we can't do without the countywides, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| can do without the commissioners until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| I mean, that's what it looks like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| It looks like what I think I hear you saying, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, is the countywides are very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| and they need to be done in a timely manner, but we don't have to worry about running with a short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:23| imbalanced legislative body, that it's okay to run with a short, imbalanced legislative body until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| That's part of the argument, but no, there are less candidates and less...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| So you're saying it would be easier, and that's why you're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Easier, just easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| I didn't run for this job to do an easy job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| I knew it was going to be tough, and that's why I'm willing to do this tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| And I think that these commission seats are, in a lot of ways, they're more important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| because this body is so lopsided right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Some districts are fully filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Some districts are half filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| One district isn't filled at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| It's so lopsided that I could make a good argument that it's more important to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| and appoint these commission seats, because right now this legislative body is not what our charter calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:20| The people are not represented equally, and some folks are not represented at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| and as hard as this is, we need to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| It's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| We took an oath to do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| Now, I don't like the circumstances that have been handed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| I'd much rather have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| I've been begging for an election, but they told us no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| They told us no, and I think the chancellor said, do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| And we need to step up to the plate, and we need to do our job, and we don't need to keep putting this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| We don't need to keep running with temporary countywide office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| We don't need to keep running with an imbalanced legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| where some folks have a stronger amount of representation than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| We are a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| We have districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| People are elected from districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Now, we can talk philosophically and say, well, we represent everybody, and the truth is we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| Ted Kennedy is a U.S. senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| He represents everybody, but he wasn't elected by me, and he doesn't represent my values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| because he was elected from a different state than I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| These commission districts are just as important as states on the local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:42| and the people of these districts need to be represented equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| We don't need this imbalanced thing, and I'm sure there's a pretty good chance this thing may pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| but it will pass because it looks like we've got a bunch of commissioners that are afraid to make controversial choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| that are afraid to do hard jobs, or maybe they think it benefits them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| I know that we have two commissioners that represent a green constituency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| They have very little voice when this commission is filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| but right now they have a strong voice because the two still remain, yet the rest of the body is thinned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:24| So they have a stronger voice now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| They want this weakened legislative body because while everyone else is weakened, they are empowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| They are empowered because the other seats aren't filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| and I would say that most people who want to vote to put this off are going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| because they are empowered with this weakened, lopsided legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| or they want to put it off because they don't want to make the tough decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| and they don't want to be criticized by the Knoxville New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| Well, I think the Knoxville New Sentinel realizes that we have a job to do and we need to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| Okay. Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| It's kind of frightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| I kind of believe what Lump is saying, and I agree with him in some aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:14| I'm looking at two proposals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| One starting the public forum at November the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| My opinion on that is too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| It's one week from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| We don't even know who wants to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| So we don't even have time to get applications in during the holiday or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| and we're going to start the process on next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| I think February the 6th is too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| I'm in agreement that we need to pick a date somewhere in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| take care of our business because we are elected to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| It's a hard decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| I don't want to make the decision either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| But I think we have to do it and we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| But waiting until February the 6th is too long and starting November the 26th is too early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:10| And we definitely don't need to do a rolling, swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| I was glad to see Saturday there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Maybe we can have it on Saturday and all the judges will be home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:28| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I knew that when I had presented this that I would be criticized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| and you certainly have not disappointed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| I would just like to respond to a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| I think that it does matter how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| I think it does matter when we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| And what I have proposed again is, from what people have told me over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| is they want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| And quite frankly, when I ask them, why do you want us to wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| it's almost unanimous in that they have said, we don't trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| Now, that hurts because we all took an oath of office to try to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| and Commissioner Lambert talks about the fact that we lack toughness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| that we're not willing to make the hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| I don't know how it can get any tougher than it has been over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| I don't know how it can get any tougher than to go through a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| I don't know how any tougher it can be to have an asterisk by your name for the rest of your life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| that you have been found guilty of violating a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| I don't know how it gets tougher than that, Commissioner, because that's where we're all faced right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| That's why I'm willing to do the appointments, want to do the appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| and willing to take the heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| But I think that it matters how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| I think it matters when we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| We can come in and talk about the budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| The budgeting process is not going to come into play until about March or April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| I don't have a problem with nine meetings in nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| But with regards to the sheriff, I have a lot of respect for Randy Nichols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| and I have known Randy Nichols for many, many years, and I respect what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| But we heard our law director tell us last week that we can go for a little while longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| with the situation that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Mr. Spangler is doing a very good job running the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| But as I mentioned earlier, if we go December 7th, that's only 38 days before early voting begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:36| We've got people out there running campaigns right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| They're doing forums right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Let's let them run their campaigns, take their message to their constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| and let the constituents vote February 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| And so I'm not trying to shirk my responsibility at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| I'm suggesting that we get together on February 6th, the day after, and start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| And let's do it on February 19th or 20th or whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| And let's go ahead and appoint, and let's go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| The notion that there are people here trying to seize power, I just like to just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I don't know how you seize power when you let people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Because the power is invested in the citizens who vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| And that's what I'm suggesting that we do, is let them vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| Let the process work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| And so anyway, I would just encourage you, again, I'm throwing this out as a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| Will you add to the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Now, Mr. Lambert, you have a, you have, I promised my wife I was going to stay calm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| You have a means of interrupting people and not being recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| Now, sir, that's not proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Now, if you would, you'll have a chance to say your piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| But please don't interrupt your colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| So I would just say that I'm, you know, if anyone has other suggestions, I'm willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| I mean, I'm not saying that this is, you know, 100 percent set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| But my feeling is, let the process work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Let these folks go out, run their campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| And then let's gather together here and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:17| We've been here for a long time talking about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| We've talked about it since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| You know, Commissioner Strickland, I mean, I don't care if we move some dates around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| Maybe if you think a week is not enough time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| maybe we start it on December the 1st on Saturday and go Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:41| Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, and then come in here on the 12th of December and make appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| It puts it out another week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:59| I'm just trying to get to a compromise that 11 people up here will agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| But, you know, some of my colleagues have said they've heard from people saying wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| And I've heard from the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| And I'm talking about people at Hardee's, people at the Amber restaurant, and not politicos, and not political people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| I'm talking about the daily citizens who have talked to me while I'm getting a sausage biscuit in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| So, I mean, maybe we're talking about two different classes of people or two different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| but I'm hearing more from the regular people and our citizens and not politicos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| And that's how I'm separating Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Not two different sets of people but two different styles or two political people saying wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| because it may affect them better in an election running for office that doesn't have an office holder in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| than running against someone who's been appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Certainly, I think, after February election, if we try to appoint somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| it is going to be so tough because then you're going to put Republicans against Democrats no matter what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| I mean, you're going to have a Republican and a Democrat, and, you know, whoever you pick is probably going to have a leg up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| That's assuming both of them do apply for the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| They may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| I'm sure you, and probably in every race, I'm sure you'll have almost positive that you'll have a Democrat and Republican candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| And then you come into a bigger mess than you've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| But I could, you know, the election shouldn't even come into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| We're appointing people to fill a job until the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| That's what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| We're not out here to try to pick somebody to win an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| We're out here to pick somebody to do the job until the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| And like I said, we've made good choices on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| We've made some bad ones, evidently, because people didn't vote to keep them in after we've appointed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| But to go back, you know, I think every Sessions judge except one has been appointed in Knox County, and they've served us well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| Every criminal court judge in Knox County now has been appointed and served us well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| The attorney general in Knox County was appointed, and he served us well, and they've won elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| So to sit here today and say we need to wait until after the election, I think it puts us in a tougher spot than we've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| Because right now all we need to do is appoint somebody to do the job, the best job that they can do until the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| And, you know, I don't care to move this thing around and put it off another week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| but I think having a forum in every district, having Channel 10 broadcast it live every night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| and having it replayed on CTV and then coming back and having another public forum, I think that's plenty of openness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| I think that's doing the best job that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| So, you know, no perfect process, but, Ruthie, if you want to come to the podium if you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:56| I probably shouldn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:07| Give us your name and address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Ruthie Coleman, 4205 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| I'm one of the candidates for District 4 CDE, and while I appreciate what Mike is trying to do, and I really do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:22| I would hope that no matter what y'all do, it would not interfere with my running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:32| Because I'm going to run no matter when you do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| I will not seek an appointment because, as you say, I want to be put in by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| I don't think anyone running for office, it should not interfere with y'all trying to fill these seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:50| These seats need to be filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| My district is not taking care of District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| Our district needs to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| There are a lot of qualified people, whether they're people who are seeking election that are going to put their name out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| Y'all need to do this, and you need to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| And I understand what Mike is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| I truly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| But waiting until after the election isn't really going to change anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| unless you're waiting to see who loses and hopefully one of them, or who wins, and that that person is going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| I would hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| I would hope that person would wait until the election is over in August and let the people vote for them then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| But I do not think that waiting until, I just don't think any of this is going to hurt the process of the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:55| and me running and having my different things throughout my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| I don't think it's going to interfere with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| So please, go ahead and do this and get it over with and quit talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| and let's go on with our county and get everything going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| Please, get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| We're tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| We just want our county to be run and run efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| and let us, the people that are running for office, to stop having to answer all the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| well, are you going to be appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Are you going to be, you know, when is this going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| I'm tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| I just want to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| That's all I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| And win, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| And be a woman up there that can tell y'all, get a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| I mean, come on, get a life and just get it over with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| and listen to Scott and what he is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| And I can't believe I'm listening to Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| It's just unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| But we need to get this done now and get it over with, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| so we can go on with what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Commissioner Moore and Commissioner Hammond, maybe we can get together here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| I may have a little Phil Ballard thing here in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| But before I mention this suggestion to you, I want to go back to one thing and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| when we talk about making a hard decision, we've had that for several meetings here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| there's been several people here talk about you can't make the hard decision not doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| I take offense to that because I remember at the last election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| there were several of us that did our homework and we worked hard and we did some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| We didn't vote in a block for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| And that's how I'm going to do it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| I'm going to research the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| But for Mr. Hammond and Scott, could we maybe be an amendment in there, Mike, that maybe we go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| I want to have somebody in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Could we go ahead and appoint a person for the fourth district in December and then add your stuff in February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| That's just to have some representation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| I'll throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Just whatever you guys, Scott, what do you all think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| I'm willing to compromise ever how we need to to get 11 people together to make these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:23| But I will not support making appointments after the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| If we're going to wait until after the election, let's just wait until September 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| and let the two candidates or how many candidates there are just run the rest of the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| Now, I think that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| Being, and I'll go back to the governor, made an appointment to the criminal court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Why didn't he just leave it open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Why didn't he have public forms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| Because it's state statute gives the governor the authority and he had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| Yeah, but he didn't have 18 positions to fill at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| He had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| But it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Well, 12 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| He had 12 positions to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| I mean, we've got county government and I don't know what the dollar amount to all these offices are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| but, you know, there's millions and millions and millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| that the taxpayers are paying somebody to manage these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| They're accountable and they're good folks running those offices, but they're not accountable to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| And, you know, I don't know what the big thing is about waiting and waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| We've been waiting two months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| We've asked everybody, I think except the president of the United States, to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| And, you know, everybody told us, guys, it's the commission's job to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| You know, I think the asking is done and it's, you know, it's time to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| And, you know, I'll work with this commission, everybody on this commission, to try to compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| and I'm sure we all have to, but I will not support anything that waits until after the February election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| I think if we do that, just wait until September 1st and let the people take their seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Mike, I wish you had been at the committee meeting and brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| Part of the importance of having the committee meetings now is that we're going to be able to talk stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| I want to ask you, would you amend your proposal to say that we run where, if we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3031)|
| 0:50:39| if your proposal is adopted, we run, since we're running with a limited legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| that we run with a limited agenda that would include no zonings and would include only essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| what it requires to keep Knox County functioning, only essential items so that all we have are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3052)|
| 0:51:01| so that we can run with this limited government with a limited agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| and wait on making decisions that affect people's lives after we have a fully filled legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| Would you be okay with something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| And again, I'm talking no zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| If it is not absolutely necessary that it be passed within the next two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| that it does not appear on the agenda because we have a lopsided, unbalanced, unfilled legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3083)|
| 0:51:33| May I answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| We met last month and had a full agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| We had a full agenda here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| We're talking about stormwater here in just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| And there are a couple of other items that are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| If something needs to be postponed, certainly we can postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| But no, I would not advocate that we come in with a limited agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| that only certain things can be heard because we don't know what those things are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| We don't know what items our fellow commissioners are going to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| But if it's something that we feel would need to be postponed for a couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| then we certainly have the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| And by the way, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to have my proposal voted up or voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| If we vote it down, then we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I think we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| We all know how we're going to vote probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| Okay, we've got a substitute motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| and it's this one that Commissioner Hammond has passed out starting with February 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| and appointing on February 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Mr. Chairman, before we vote, can I ask the maker of the motion in a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| if they would just make one minor change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| And that is that as far as the meetings, the open forums that he has sort of outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:49| if we could just make it that we meet between, that those forums come between certain dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| and not necessarily be date mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| Like if we meet starting on the 12th and have it wrapped up by nine days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| so that we could have it on, have all nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| Sure, yes, I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| And we could set those dates next month or even in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| It's not that we necessarily have to set them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| It's just that, you know, what we're doing is voting on the appointment date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| and that we will have open forums between, I think you started on the 12th and the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| You might as well make it like maybe the 10th or some other date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| I don't have a calendar in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| But we can certainly set those dates so that every commissioner can try to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| if they wish to have an open forum in just their district, they have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| If the commissioner feels that it's that important, then I feel that we should honor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| If commissioners feel that they think they can do that by combining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| then they should have that prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| So I think Commissioner Pinkston is correct that if he thinks it's important that he holds his own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| then I wish that he had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Clerk, we're voting on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Just do a roll call starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3277)|

| 0:54:39| Commissioner Tony Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3279)|

| 0:54:42| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| Six ayes and five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| So the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| Okay, clerk, if we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| So the motion is to start after February the 13th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| After the February elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| Okay, clerk, if you'll read 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| I had a prior engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| I'm going to have to leave, so I'd like to hear ordinance 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:39| 104, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| For purposes of the record, I told the law director to kick me or something before we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| I need you to read into the record, please, if that would be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| Because I am an employee of the Knox County Trustee's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| I may have a conflict of interest in the proposal that we just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| However, I declare that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| and my obligation to my constituents and to the citizens this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| I just want to make that part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| Clerk, 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| 104 is amending Ordinance O-04-5-101A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| by substituting the term $6 for the term $36 wherever it appears in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:37| That's Ordinance O-04-5-101A as amended, effective July 13th, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3397)|

| 0:56:48| We're on 104?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| We vote at 6-0 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| I'll make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| You stated earlier in the meeting you wished to defer 104 until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Did I misunderstand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| You misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| What did you defer until December then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| 103?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| No, it was a resolution, 104, not Ordinance 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Seconded by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| I'm saying that to get it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| This is with regards to rescinding the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| I believe that the idea of reducing taxes is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| I like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| But in this instance, it would take effect immediately, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| No, it takes two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| It would be effected 10 days, Mr. Law Director, after December 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| 15 days after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| 15 days after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| So we're looking at we're in the middle of a budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| The wheel tax represents $12 million in revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| It seems to me that doing this without a well-thought-out and specific plan on where cuts would occur could be harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:15| And so we don't know who would be hurt from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| Would the schools be hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Would the elderly be hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| Would our neighborhoods be hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Would law enforcement be hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| At this moment, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| And so while I like the idea of reducing taxes, I do want to join with you as we go through the budget process and looking at our spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:39| Because I believe that there are areas that we really need to look at, that we really need to rein in on some of the spending in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| And let's see what we can do to cut our spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| And once we do that and have identified those areas, then I think that we can look at our tax rate and see if there's some adjustments that we could be making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| But I'm just concerned that we're right in the middle of a budget year and to cut $12 million out just kind of carte blanche is something that could be harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3536)|
| 0:59:07| Well, Commissioner Hammond, if you look at our total budget and you talk about $12 million, we're still leaving the $6 wheel tax in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:16| Also, the clerk of Knox County receives 5% for collecting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| So that's probably $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| So realistically, you're talking probably about $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| And over our total budget is probably somewhere 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| But still, if you did it over a total year, you're talking about 1.7% decrease in the total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| And we've all sit here today and talked about what our citizens want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| I don't think I've talked to anybody over the last week that said they didn't want us to put county government on a diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| You know, we've gone through things where some misspending has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| And I think we need to show the people in Knox County that we're going to be accountable for the money in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3594)|
| 1:00:03| And I think we need to ask our office holders to do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| I think they're doing good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| But I think we can always do better in collecting the wheel tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| And I don't know, Mr. Stooksbury is here, that they say there's no way to police it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| People walk into the clerk's office and say, I'm exempt from the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| And they just say, sign this piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| So I think, you know, until we have policies in place that we can assure the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| who's supposed to be paying the wheel tax are paying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| But I think it's, I think, too, I think the citizens with gas prices, when we voted this in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| or the citizens voted it in in 2004 or vote themselves in a property tax increase, which I voted against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| I said we should put it up or down without anything else tied to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| Then gas and oil and, you know, out where we're from, me and Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| our utility, Hollisdale Powell, has gone up 24%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| KUB has gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| And we have families out here working hard trying to raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| And I think we should do what we need to in government, not grow government, but to make government smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| and do the things that are essential to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| And all this other stuff we may have to put a hold on for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| And that's where I'm coming from with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Because I know there's families out there right now having hard times paying KUB bills, paying gas to get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| And I think it's time that we step up and put this government on a diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| So, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| I'm with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| My concerns are that it's in the middle of a budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| How would you feel about voting on this today, but making it take effect at the beginning of the next budget year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3707)|
| 1:01:56| And when would that be, March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| But in my mind, I think we've got families out there that need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Yeah, we definitely need some tax relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| I've had a couple of constituents call me already this week asking if I could help them find a job because they got laid off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:15| because their companies were downsizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| I believe that we need some tax relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| And I believe that this was the wrong tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| And I believe it was at the wrong time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| And it was implemented in the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| You know, there's not a lot of trust in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| And a lot of folks think that that started on January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| January 31st might have increased the mistrust of Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:43| but I think in 2004 when this government voted for the first time in the history of this country that I know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| to blackmail its citizens into supporting an unpopular tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| I believe that's when Knox County started to lose some of its credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| And I think that we can gain back some of that credibility if we'll give these folks some tax relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| at a time when they desperately need it the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| So I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| But I would like to consider what budget cuts are going to have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:17| Hang on, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Mr. Stixbury, before you leave, can you come down and tell us about the process of being exempted from the will tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:27| Because we're hearing some people are getting around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:45| Yes, sir, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| What would you like to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| Well, if I walk in your office and I say whatever the exemptions are, I'm 62 or 65 and I make less than $12,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:58| what would your office do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| The process is if you tell us that there, we will put a form up and you're actually signing that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:08| And if this commission would like to do it any other way, we'd be glad to change that within the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:15| But you have to understand that the individual, if they're signing that, they're actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| if they're not actually exempt, they're probably purging themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| So if you'd like for that to be changed, then this commission could vote to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| We'll do whatever you'd like for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Well, I mean, we've just started hearing this and it's been going on since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| So if there was a problem, somebody should have come to us earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| Because I see it in the audit that was performed after January 31st that had, you know, loss of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| because people were just signing if you're disabled or whatever the exemptions are that this commission passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| that somebody's just thrown out a piece of paper and they were, you know, I think Mr. Tindall may have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| that there were some employees that had been exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| I'm not aware of that there, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| So you're saying if anybody walks into your office and says they're exempt, that your office exempts them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| If they qualify for the exemption, they actually sign the form themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| But there's no policies in place to check or make people bring something in saying they're disabled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| To my knowledge, there's nothing that was within the resolution that asked us to do that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| It just asked us to, for them to, for us to initiate the actual will tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| and have the individual sign it if they were exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| And how many exemptions do you do in a total year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| There's probably five or 6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| Commissioner Hammond, I mean Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| I get some of this mail sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| We are follicly challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| I'd just like to point out that we're staring down the barrel of what is the total debt obligation related to the expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:23| deputy pension of $100 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| We're staring down the barrel of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| I think we've just sort of got this thing in the wrong order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| First we find the cuts that would help us in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Maybe meet some of our obligations to actually get our school kids up to at least the state average and keep it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:41| Or if your priorities are tax cuts, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| But find the cuts in spending first before you go about cutting this will tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| It's a bit like your household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| You don't say, okay, you know, we're going to spend more, go on a credit card binge, and quit one of our part-time jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4012)|
| 1:07:02| That doesn't balance your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| And it won't balance our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| So let's be reasonable about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Let's get the order straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| I'm all for cutting taxes, but first we have to find the spending cuts that we can make to justify this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| First, Commissioner Harmon, I'd like to correct you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| I believe we're above the state average on per child spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| I think we just got there this year, and I'm very proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| I want us to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| You made a comment that you hoped we'd get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| Well, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| We're there, I think, with what we were able to get from the state, and I just want us to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Again, I agree with you that reducing taxes is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| And I believe that tightening our belts is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| But I have to be concerned when we do not have a specific plan on where these cuts are going to come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| whether it's $6 million or $8 million, whatever the figure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| We're already into November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| We're going to be looking at a new budget in April and May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| And I fully intend, as I'm sure we all do, to look at our spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| and look at some of these policies and procedures that we really need to look at and perhaps cut back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| I guess I'm a bit hesitant to say, let's take away your revenue stream and, all right, folks, tighten up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| Because without a specific plan of where the tightening up is going to come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| I think that we're looking for a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| And so, whereas I agree with the notion of, hey, if we can reduce taxes, let's do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| the other area is, if we're going to cut, I think we need a plan of where the cuts are going to come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| who's going to be affected, and what areas are going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| Well, I think I respect what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| But I think when we passed this, we told people it went everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| There was going to be some money in senior centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| There's money in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| There's money in here, money in there, and just a little bit of money everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| So if the notion is that money went everywhere, then surely we could take back 1.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4137)|
| 1:09:05| And hopefully people in the other offices, in the fee offices, will do a better job at collecting us more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| But, you know, I think government, as much money as you can give it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| and we could give it another $12 million and I'm sure we could spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| I'm sure we could spend it by in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| But, you know, and probably on good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| But right now when people are having a hard time, I think we ought to tighten our belt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| because I know there's families across Knox County that's not getting to do the things they did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| And that may be not going on vacation or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| But to say that we can't cut, we can't find the cuts, I think is, you know, it's just government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:49| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| I appreciate what you're trying to do, and I understand what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| I would like to be able to cut taxes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| Like we said, I've heard before, is, you know, we need to know where those cuts would come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:13| I'd hate to think of what the bond market may be thinking about us if we're cutting $6 million out of our revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:21| If I remember this right, John, if you'll, or the mayor, if you'll correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| but I believe we took $7 million out of the fund balance in our last budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| to try to get to making that we have a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| So we didn't have revenues meet expenditures by $7 million already in the budget that we're currently in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:51| We took money out of our, basically our savings account to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| Now, I would be in favor of rescinding the will tax in the next year's budget and have it start July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4256)|
| 1:11:10| and just go back to, you know, our other forms of revenue and make that balance what the expenditures are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4270)|
| 1:11:18| and try to hold those taxes down, take a look at where we can make these cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| I just don't think that now is the proper time to do that, although I agree with you, people are hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| I would like to be able to do this and I can, you know, we can do this starting July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| I'd be in agreeance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| If the mayor or John, if you'd like to comment on this, what your thoughts are on how this would impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:48| And, Jim, I'll get to you in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4308)|
| 1:12:02| I think everybody likes the idea about lower taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| That shouldn't be even an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| Who doesn't like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| On the other hand, it wasn't that long ago that we passed a budget by a 19-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| And to do something at this point in time would be very difficult for us to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| If you want to go forward with it, we'll work the best we can with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| However, again, 19-0 vote, this budget passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| I think it's a good budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| It moves our school children forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| We do have a network of senior centers in place now where I think each of you would view the monies being very well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| Eliminated a waiting list for mobile meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Have well over 100 fewer employees, not fewer deputies or not fewer teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| but fewer government workers than we did when I started office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| We've been able to give raises, including bonuses, to our workers who I think deserve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| So can we get better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Absolutely we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| And whatever you decide, you're the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| We presented a budget to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| You approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| We're going to work with you to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| At this point in time, I'd be less than truthful if I said it would be something easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| I do think the bond market would take a pretty strong look at us very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| But we'll work with you in whatever decision you make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| Mayor, or whoever can answer this question, maybe even the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| when we have a budget, it gets approved by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| But that's not the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| It has to go to the state to be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| And the state has to agree that, yes, your expenditures and your revenues do match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| If we change our revenue stream, do we have to go back to the state to be recertified that we have a balanced budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:56| We have to go back not only with our budget, but also with the bonding capacity we just approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| including the $57 million we absorbed for the initial phase of the sheriff's pension plan, which our citizens voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:13| So it would take more than just a simple passing this on to ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| Our budget has to be physically sound, and I don't think the state is going to let us go any other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| So we'd have to have the cuts to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Commissioner Lambert, can I make a counterproposal that we repeal the wheel tax effective July 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:38| I would rather just see it voted up or down today because I think the people right now need it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| They don't need it in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| But, you know, I think if we've seen over the last months of we approved a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| but there were some things in there that I think misled me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| And it's hard to go out and try to defend it to the citizens when they're having hard problems and hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| And I think for the next six months we tighten our belt and we look at the budget when budget time comes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| But during good times, I think the county should go forward with some additional projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| But in times of a slow economy, people losing their jobs, gas prices at $3 a gallon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| your waste water and sewage charges are going up 24%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| Things are costing people more at the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| That I think it's our job to take care of the citizens and serve them in essential services that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| and not worry about all the fluff that goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| So, I mean, I'd just rather vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| And, Jim, I'd like to recognize you and apologize you came up once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| Oh, no, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| I'm getting educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| No complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| No concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| We came to the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| And would you give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4556)|

| 1:16:04| We were at the agenda meeting the other day, and we drove home, my wife and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| scratching our heads trying to figure out what was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| You take what we understand to be a $36 tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| You're going to take $30 of it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| That is paid when somebody gets their plates that's tacked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| I guess I'm trying to figure out either this is a useful tax or it isn't a useful tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:35| Being a property owner, I understand it as one tax that's distributed to the whole population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| whether they own property or not, which, being a property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| I kind of like that, but as an overall percentage of the entire budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| I don't know what's behind this trying to knock $30 off of a $36 tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| If you can go that far, why was the tax ever instituted, and why couldn't you just flat out abolish it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4615)|
| 1:17:03| I can't believe that $30 once a year is going to make that big a difference to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:11| and I may regret this being a candidate, but I'm not sure how $30 knocked off once a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| is going to relieve gas prices, food, or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| If those people are in severe problems, we need to figure out a serious way to help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| not just knock $30 off once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| So maybe I don't understand the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Maybe I don't understand the ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| But as a part of an overall tax, this seems like it's in the noise level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| and I would really question why we're bothering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| Let's look at some serious budget cuts and get serious about helping people that are having hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| So if I don't understand something, I'd sure appreciate you straightening me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| And I thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| I didn't get all your comment, but one of the comments was we didn't need the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| Why did we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Well, I think that those things probably went in my mind to good projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| But, you know, it's been operating for three, probably, what, three years now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| So that's $36 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| I think we've accomplished some things with $36 million additional dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| But as I said before, during times of slow economy, I think it's time that we give back to the people that need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:29| We spend millions of dollars every year helping people who cannot do things for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| as the homeless initiatives and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| So not to help people who pay the bills in times of a slow economy is I don't see the fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4718)|
| 1:18:46| Because government, we can scale back and we can provide the services that we're doing with a loss of about $6 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:55| And, you know, the wheel tax failed, I believe, in every part of the county except the west end of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| It failed in eight districts in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| So there's a lot of people out there that were against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| In south Knox County, north Knox County, east Knox County, that voted against it, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4754)|
| 1:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| Also, the way this tax was implemented, do you believe it was appropriate for a government to blackmail its citizens by telling them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4765)|
| 1:19:33| if you don't vote for this wheel tax, we're going to raise your property tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| Do you believe that's a good way to run government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| No, probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| I mean, you can see why people want this repealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| bad taste in their mouth because for the first time in history, a municipality blackmailed its citizens into supporting a tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:58| And I think that now times are tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| People need some tax relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| And if we're going to have tax relief, let's relieve the most unpopular tax, a tax that was implemented in a very heavy-handed way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:13| If we're going to give some tax relief, let's relieve the tax that people want done away with the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| May I yield the podium to somebody who's back here poking me in the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| Your boss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Your boss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| My campaign manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Donna McEvers, 12630 Early Drive, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| Regarding the wheel tax and quote-unquote blackmail, I voted for the wheel tax because as a property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:51| personally I am so tired of carrying the burden that I really supported this tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| I still support it because it spreads some of that tax burden to renters, people who don't own property in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:09| And if it is going to be rescinded, I would think you should address that in the next budget session, not halfway through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4869)|
| 1:21:19| So that's my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| I think we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=4881)|

| 1:24:45| Mr. Payne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Yeah, actually I have a couple of concerns I'd like to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| First, I'd like to thank Mary Ann Stackhouse for all the hard work she put in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| She's been wonderful to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| My first concern is with the proposed paragraph A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| where it actually names all of the offices that the amendment would apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| Now, the Knox County 1 question has a proposal that would take five of those offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| and make them appointed positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| And if that passes in 2008, then right off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| we've got five offices listed on here that are going to be appointed positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| as opposed to elected positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:28| I don't know, Mr. Payne, if there's anything on the ballot question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| to have those offices appointed on the ballot of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| It's not on the ballot yet, but they're in the process of getting that petition certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| So in light of that possibility, and this could happen in the future as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| we've got a language that we would like to substitute that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| this recall provision applies to all elected county offices in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| except such offices of which recall is not permitted by the Tennessee Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| or other provisions of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5156)|
| 1:26:07| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Well, I believe that that's, let me ask Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| do you consider that a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| That's what I wanted to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| Are we basically saying the same thing in a different way, Ms. Stackhouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| We've made some changes to this since the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| You have been passed out a revised draft, which includes additional language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| Mr. Payne has received this language and had the opportunity to look at it prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| Let Mary Ann take you through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| Are we still talking about who this could apply to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| Right, paragraph A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| I think the difference between the amendment that we have passed out to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| and the one Mr. Payne has passed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| his language just says it won't be applicable to those to whom it may not be applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| under the Constitution or laws of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| but obviously leaves there the question, well, to whom would that actually apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:18| The one that we passed out actually has a list of the officials that we believe a recall could be applied to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5238)|
| 1:27:28| in light of the Jordan decision of the Supreme Court and the enabling legislation for charters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| where we know that under the enabling legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| the judicial branch cannot be affected by a county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| My concern with the language Mr. Payne has recommended is that it may still leave us in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| where we would find ourselves litigating to whom does the recall amendment apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| because then we would still be litigating, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| who does the Tennessee Constitution or the laws preclude a recall amendment from applying to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| I'm obviously partial to our language that lists clearly the offices that we believe the recall amendment could apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:23| Let me just go farther down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| In paragraph D, we have still left blank the number of days after final certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5306)|
| 1:28:36| because that is a choice that this commission can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| I think Mr. Payne's organization has recommended, is it 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| And that certainly is something this body can consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| The one thing that we did add since we last spoke with the commission last Tuesday, on page 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| there is a new section G, and then the paragraphs have been renumbered accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:10| It dawned on me, frankly, that if there were a recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| and then you are moving into an election to fill the vacancy with 90 days for a primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| and then another 75 for a general, you could be having five-plus months with a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| So you'll see there that new paragraph G says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| in the event the incumbent is recalled, then subject to provision H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| and pending the election provided for in section H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| the county commission may fill the vacancy temporarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| provided, however, that said temporary appointee shall serve only until the election results are certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| and the newly elected official is qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| And depending upon which position is an issue, the commission may or may not decide to fill it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| but at least that paragraph G would make it clear that the commission could fill it if they chose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:14| And then the rest of the language, there's a new section at paragraph I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:24| We had had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| Mr. Payone has seen the new paragraph I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| But we had this conversation last Tuesday about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| or not the commission could render something a misdemeanor, and we had some concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5433)|
| 1:30:39| So what we have done there is we have declared it would be a violation of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| punishable by a fine of $1,000 for any person, directly or indirectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| personally or through any other person to, as you can see, interfere with a recall effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:57| It would give the General Sessions Court jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| And that particular penalty would be in addition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| and not instead of any provision of state law that might render those acts a felony or a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:15| So that's somewhat of a nuanced, a new position in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| But I suppose the area of real disagreement, at least between Mr. Payone and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:27| and I'm not speaking for the commission, is whether or not we should have a litany list of persons in paragraph A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| or whether we ought to leave it in a more generalized way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| Obviously it's this commission's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| My personal recommendation would be to have a list so that we are clear on who we are trying to apply the recall provision to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:49| and so that the voters are clear when they vote on the proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| That would be a concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| My name is Mark Siegel, and I've worked with the recall committee as an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5520)|
| 1:32:07| My address is 3827 Glenfield Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| And Mr. Payone has asked me to address this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| which I believe is the major difference between the committee and the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| And the committee is greatly appreciative of working with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:34| in being able to come this close and hopefully get something that everybody can agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| But the committee's concern is if the law changes at any point with respect to the way the charter is drawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5562)|
| 1:32:54| with respect to any of the specific offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5574)|
| 1:33:01| you may end up with a charter that lists specific offices and that's somehow at variance with another provision of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:10| or with state law or with the Constitution in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| And so they have tried to draw this so that it would incorporate whatever changes would occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:24| whereas the list is a list that may end up being at some point wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5604)|
| 1:33:32| So excuse me for interrupting, but so is your concern, I'm over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| so is your concern that an office might get its duties redrafted or its actual name changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| and that would invalidate its being under this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| Or what's now an elected office may become an appointed office so that you can't recall an appointed office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5626)|
| 1:33:58| There's essentially you can't envision all the kinds of changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:05| but we've just talked about two different things that might occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| that might end up leaving you with a charter provision that was an anachronism, that was outdated, that was frankly wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5649)|
| 1:34:18| And the committee, what the committee wants to do essentially is say this has application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5658)|
| 1:34:26| And for right now, we have a very authoritative legal decision in the term limits cases to how this would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5666)|
| 1:34:37| I mean the Supreme Court of the state of Tennessee has made a decision and said essentially certain seats are affected by term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5677)|
| 1:34:51| certain offices are affected by term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| and it would be those same positions that would be affected potentially by a recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5693)|
| 1:35:03| And if things change in relation to how any of those positions sit now, then they may change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:11| and this provision would allow the recall provision to stay in compliance with those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:27| Okay. Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| I'm in favor of this, so I'm prepared to vote for it, but I do have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| My first one is I just want to make sure clarification in the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| On the first one we got, it said that the petition would contain a general statement of the grounds upon which removal is sought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5740)|
| 1:35:46| Is that still in there, or was that changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| No, that is still in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| It's in paragraph E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| It sets out a sample of how in the recall election what the question would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5755)|
| 1:36:02| and it still says shall name of the official be recalled and removed from the office of name of office on the following grounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:11| and there would be grounds, and shall an election of a successor be held, and then the voter would vote yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:21| I guess that term general statement bothers me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| because if you're going to recall a person who has been elected to a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| rather than a general statement, it should be a specific statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| But if you're coming in and you're saying that the following grounds, I guess you would need to be specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| or would we need to do some wording on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| I mean, you know, you could be generic on something, or you can be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| I would like to be specific and say, okay, this is why this lousy so-and-so needs to be kicked out of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5806)|
| 1:36:52| and put it down there as to why the petition is being circulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| And the petition that was suggested there in paragraph E would expect the person seeking the recall to put the grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:07| Do you see that, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| Yes, on the following grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| And so I guess it would be up to the people putting together the petition to put the grounds on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| Put the grounds on there, and then when they submit that to the election commission the first time for just approval of the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:24| certification of the form, then the election commission would certify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| And I just want to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| We're saying that if you are a commissioner or a board of education person, it would have to be from people in that district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| And countywide, you're saying 15% of those registered to vote in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| So it's not people who voted, it's people who are registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| And I guess my last question is, it says that a recall petition could be done six months after a person is elected or sworn into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5866)|
| 1:37:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| That is Mr. Payone's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| I think I could explain your reasoning, but go ahead and you explain your reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| Well, it's like a cool-down period in the event of like a hotly contested election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| The last thing I want is to see this thing abused by anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| And I don't want someone to say, oh, well, we lost this race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| We have enough people to get a recall petition together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Let's start one circulating the day this person takes office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| I don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| Oh, and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| And I guess my reservation is six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| The reason I say that is because there is a learning curve on any office that you come into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| whether it's county commission or whether it's school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| And it would seem to me that in a hotly contested race, that if you did have a narrow victory by one person over the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:46| they could say, hey, we'll get this person in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| Let's just bide our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| And then in six months, we'll come in and we'll have some grounds and we'll do a petition or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| I would like to see that at least a year because if anybody is not doing their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| I mean, if they're guilty of misdemeanor or if they're guilty of a felony or embezzlement or bribery or any of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:07| you've got criminal laws that can be brought against this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| But if it's if it's just to say, OK, politics, and we all know how politics can be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| OK, let's count down the days and in six months we'll start a recall petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| To me, that's just too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Would you be willing to go with a year to give an individual to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| An individual who's been popularly elected would have at least a year to prove themselves unless, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| they've created some kind of criminal wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| My largest concern with that is that the way state law is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| We're only going to have the first two years to be able to recall someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| It wouldn't be effective during the last two years because the way to dash five dash one five one is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| And you can correct me if I'm wrong. Miss Stackhouse is that you can only put a recall question on the ballot of the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=5994)|
| 1:40:02| So if it was done during the last two years of that official's office, it's going to be on the ballot when they'd be up for election anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| So to say one year would be shutting that window to just one year that they would have to exercise this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6009)|
| 1:40:17| And as I understand, the petitioning process could potentially take up to a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| which is why we decided to leave that six month window in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| It's a bit short, but in the end, we wanted to err on the side of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| And we wanted to be able to give them the most opportunity to have a say until we can get state law change, if that ever happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:42| I think you might take some comfort in the fact that I don't think that I think this is a very, in a sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:52| burdensome process to actually implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| And I don't think that people are going to take it on lightly because of the numbers of signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| and the time limits that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| It either involves a great deal of people power or a great deal of money being invested into doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6067)|
| 1:41:14| And I don't think people are going to enter into it lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| And I don't think it's going to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| There's going to be successful petitions that are often able to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:32| So I don't think you're going to see recalls every two years now if this goes into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:40| But it is, as you say, there is a procedure of ouster if basically you have a criminal violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6100)|
| 1:41:49| But this is a political procedure where the populace, in essence, can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:57| you know, we thought we had Prince Charming, but it turned out we elected a frog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| And we want to, you know, if there's enough people that feel that way, then you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| But I don't think that's going to happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Commissioner Hammond, if I could just address the timing question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| Actually, I think that in light of the fact that a recall can only happen at a general county election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6135)|
| 1:42:22| which is in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| So basically what you're really having is sort of a midterm recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| I think in actuality you could say that the person would have to be in office for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:40| and you can still meet the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| And let me just see if I can give an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| If we think back to August of 2006, you elect an official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| If they had to be in office for a year, then after September 1 of 2007, they would have been in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:58| At that point, if a recall effort wanted to commence under the timing of 2-5-1-5-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6178)|
| 1:43:07| you actually will have then plenty of time to get ready for the recall in August of 2008, which is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:15| You'd have from September 1 until August of 2008 or whatever year we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:22| The maximum number of days I think that it could take under the recall statute is about 215 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| and that assumes that a few things went wrong, that the petition wasn't in correct form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| and it came back from the election commission and you had to cure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| And I think when I was calculating back, and I gave you all that little diagram last Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| it looked like out of an abundance of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| a citizen seeking a recall should probably begin in December prior to the August election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| So actually for someone to hold office for a year and then the recall would start up, say, in that fall or December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6234)|
| 1:44:02| they would have plenty of time to get it on the ballot for that following August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| And it would avoid the concern Mr. Payone has that it wouldn't be just a knee-jerk reaction to a lost election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6248)|
| 1:44:15| and it would meet the concern that you have to give the guy a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| You could do it for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| You could do it for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| In my opinion, you could do it for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| Okay. Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| That was some of the things I was going to go over was the timing, that a year gave plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6272)|
| 1:44:45| And as far as the listing of the officers, I think after going through what we just did with the term limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:56| and which office holders could be term limited, which of them can't, I think it's best to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6296)|
| 1:45:04| If for some reason there is, say, what's now an elected position became an appointed position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:13| that could only be done through a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| And obviously you could make, if this were to happen, then this would affect the recall position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| And I think that would take care of your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| So, you know, this is a charter change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| and anything that would move a position from being elected to an appointed position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6331)|
| 1:45:40| would take a charter change at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| So I think that should address your concerns as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:50| Okay. Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| Brian, you know, me and you have talked about this cooling off period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| And honestly, when you've been around politics as long as I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| and you've seen how things get, things get pretty hot during an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| So you need a significant amount of time for things to cool down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| And I think that Mr. Hammond's ideal of a year is quite reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| and I'd like to make that I was the one that moved that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| So I'd like to make that a part of my motion, that we put the language of one year or 365 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:32| however you want to put it in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| And, again, I know you may not like that, but trust me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| a year is a very reasonable cooling off period after a heated election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Are we working off this revised draft that Mary Ann has brought forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| or are we working off of the one from Mr. Pion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| I was thinking we were working off Mary Ann's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| They're both about the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| There's only minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| Now, as far as the cooling off period goes, I'm married, so I know all about compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| What about nine months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| If nine months is sufficient enough to create a life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| it should be sufficient enough to decide whether or not a politician is worthy for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| Brian, I'm afraid I'm pretty firm on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| and I think a good majority of folks who have been through the political process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| and know how heated and how hot it gets, I think that, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:36| I just don't think I can compromise on a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| and I think Mr. Hammond brought up some very, very good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| And we want to pass a good recall amendment to move this county forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6464)|
| 1:47:53| but at the same time we don't want to pass something that's going to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| in heated knee-jerk reactions after every election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| And I think that a year, given a person a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| that's just 12 meetings to prove themselves is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| We'll go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| But if there's any problems with it, I guess I'll just be right back here to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| We're sure you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| And, Brian, I really appreciate all the work that you've done on this and your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| On camera I've talked with Ms. Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| I really appreciate the work you guys have done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| This is government at its best when citizens come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| and bring it to the legislative body, and I really appreciate the work you've done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| But it's been all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| Commissioners, let me just remind you that Paragraph D right now, the draft I gave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:49| has a blank for the number of days within which the recall petition has to be filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6529)|
| 1:48:56| with the Election Commission after signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| And the statute says 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| I think Mr. Payone's group is suggesting 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| This is one of the provisions that the statute gives you, authority to choose your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:15| You may either follow the 75 days of the statute or you may select another time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| The idea here is how much time will the movement have to get the petition signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6561)|
| 1:49:28| and returned to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| Mr. Payone, do you prefer the 90 as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Then I think we should leave that as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:42| Up to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| It's the Commission's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| We're 15 days apart here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| Based on new technology, e-mail lists, fax lists, and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| either method is either 75 or 90 days is going to give you sufficient time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| It's not like things used to be where you had to go out to the grocery store with a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:16| When we did the wheel tax petition drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| we had folks all over town that we didn't even have any idea were a part of the movement working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| So depending on what the other commissioners think, I'm happy either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| Guess what I'm saying is that if it takes going with the 75 to make some of the commissioners comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| then I'm willing to go with the 75, and I'm asking you if you are too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| We've stood here tonight and we've given up quite a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| I think giving the citizens three months to get their stuff together to collect potentially 40,000 plus signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| I think that's quite fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| If there's anybody else that has a problem with that, then I guess discuss it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| Does anybody have a problem with 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| Everybody's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| Well, I think we're okay with that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6671)|

| 1:51:55| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6716)|

| 1:51:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| We've got a couple that I think we've added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| Let's go to the Knox County Board of Education asking us to expand the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| And they have appointed at their last November 7th board member, Mr. Thomas Deakins, to sit on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6729)|
| 1:52:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Motion made by Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| And the reasoning for that is this, and Commissioner Pinkston, please feel free to chime in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| At our last ethics committee meeting, we discussed the fact, and I have met with Mr. Deakins about the notion of him being the representative on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:48| Right now on the ethics committee, you already have someone from the schools, Ms. Kim Waller, who has served very ably over the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6768)|
| 1:52:57| I suggested that they meet with her to see if perhaps there was any issues with her being the representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6777)|
| 1:53:04| She is already there with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| Also, you have Ms. Julia Tucker, who has been on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| She is a former school superintendent, very knowledgeable about school affairs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| I'm not against Mr. Deakins coming on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| Let me make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| But what happens is that gives us 10 members on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| And we went on record last time as saying that rather than expand the board, let's look at who is on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| Because the school people have not even, as Ms. Waller is here, have they discussed with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| And I suggested that perhaps they get together with Ms. Waller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| That's why I'd like to make a substitute motion that we delay this for 30 days to allow them the opportunity to talk with Ms. Waller and just find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:42| And then if we need to address it again in 30 days, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| I talked to, I can't remember, it might have been Cindy Buttrey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| talking about that Ms. Waller represents more of the school folks and not the elected board of the school board itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| Just like county commission, we have county commissioners sitting on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| And then we have other people from the sheriff's office and then citizens as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:09| I think that's their intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| I don't know if that's something that Ms. Waller can work out with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6850)|
| 1:54:17| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| I think they feel like that you represent a different organization, I guess, in the school system and not the elected school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6858)|
| 1:54:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| And I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| And I pointed that out in our ethics committee meeting that if a school board member were on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| Excuse you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| Can I get you to give us your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| Kim Waller, 2533 Buffett Mill Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| If there is a board member on the ethics committee, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| But as I stated in our ethics committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| it needs to be clear that I don't think a board member should be the school representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6896)|
| 1:55:04| because we really do represent two different perspectives from the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| I think the concern I heard from some members of the ethics committee was if I were on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:17| or whoever follows me that works for the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| would it be like an employee and their boss sitting on the same committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:28| And could that be uncomfortable for people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| So I think that was the concern I heard from members of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| One of my concerns about this is this would give us a ten-member body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| and there would be a possibility of tie votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| Has the ethics committee discussed how they would handle ties if you do have a tenth member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6952)|
| 1:55:58| It would fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| I don't know if there were a vote, as I understand Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| But we addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| We passed a resolution at our last ethics committee meeting asking that it not be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| But, again, we're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| Commissioner Pinkston, please join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| That's why I'm asking just for 30 days because they haven't even talked with Ms. Waller at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| And I'd like for her to have an opportunity to have some dialogue with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| and then come back and address some of these issues that we have about the dynamics of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| We have a lot of these boards that aren't represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| and I just feel like we discussed there that it's going to put a lot of pressure on Ms. Waller, the way she votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6988)|
| 1:56:36| You know, we don't vote silently, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| So, you know, I think, you know, you're sitting there and you say, well, a board member is not her boss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| but they sure could send her to East Knoxville somewhere or West Knoxville, a long way from where she lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| I've worked in both locales already, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| But, I mean, they could make it hard on you and your job sending her somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| that, you know, it's a long way from her home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| I just, of course, I'll refer to the school teacher there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:08| Oh, you wouldn't think that the school board would act like that, would you, Mr. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| I don't know. I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| Okay, we've got to, is that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| A substitute motion that we delay this for 30 days to give them an opportunity to talk and work things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| We may work it out, and I'm going to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7049)|

| 1:57:31| Opposed, no. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| I think we have another stormwater maintenance agreement that was handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| I thought we had already voted to wait until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| No, it's not the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| The maintenance agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| This is a consideration to approve covenants for permanent maintenance of stormwater facilities by CBJ, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7072)|
| 1:58:05| and Fulton Properties, LLC for property located in River Meadows, Unit 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:11| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Opposed, no. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| I think we're on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| Mr. Chairman, if you can either go ahead and go with the order you got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:30| but Hugh Holt is here to discuss the changes in the procurement card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:37| and we can either start off with him or he can be wherever you wish to put him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:43| Let's get the citizens first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| They may want to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| Shannon Sitto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| 12117 Thornbird Way, Knoxville 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| This is regarding Item 917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| I probably should have stood up, but I have trouble standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| This is ‑‑ I've talked to the state on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| and they indicated the Attorney General has judicially reinforced the Sunshine Law against the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:16| and there is already a statute for the Sunshine provision from January 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7156)|
| 1:59:24| It's Item 3-1-118, and it applies to the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:30| And if you vote this in, you'd have to change the Constitution in order to make your recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:38| What I'd like to see is that you recommend compliance within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7178)|
| 1:59:46| And I know Commissioner Luthal mentioned the Tennessee Walls issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| Well, there is many local officials and state officials that were indicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| It's not ‑‑ it just bought up in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| And so a lot of the county people and the commissioners, like in Shelby County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7201)|
| 2:00:08| were bringing this to the state officials, so they were both indicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| And so I think it's very important that the county adopts this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| to show the public that they're really in support of the Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| instead of turning around and telling the state they're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| when they already have legislation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| That was basically it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| Ms. Sittow, I don't think the state legislature, they're exempt from the Sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| But they've already adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| It requires, for them to violate, it requires a quorum, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| Well, that would be like ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| In Item 3-1-118, and your recommendations would, like I said, at least in their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7245)|
| 2:00:54| And Ms. Sittow, they have to vote on that every session to make it apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| Do they really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| According to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| You know, I think what we're sending the spirit of the resolution is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| if it's good enough for local officials that are close to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| then they're 200 miles down the road from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| and they shouldn't be conducting business in secret either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| Okay, but I think that you're not saying it's good enough for local officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| What you're doing is you're saying tell the state what to do, but don't adopt it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| No, that's not what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| What we're saying is that apply it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| It already applies to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| We're just saying that they need to apply the same standard to themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| that they're wanting to apply to us, whatever that standard is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| But they have three processes to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| You, as a county commission, vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| They have the House that goes to the Senate that goes to a veto process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| I mean, it's a different entity altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| which is why the application is somewhat different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| And I can't see why you don't have the resolution for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| Well, we're already under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| We're already under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| I'm aware you're under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| But the resolution that the city adopted as an example supporting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| I think would be kind of nice to see for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| Well, maybe we can put it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| We support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| But, you know, whatever we support, we think everybody should follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| Open government can be good at local and it can be just as good at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| You know, so that's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| Are you going to say that they don't vote every time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| It says every meeting of the General Assembly, Senate, House, or Representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| or any joint committee, standing committee, statutory committee, special committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| and so forth shall be open to the public, and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| It doesn't say every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| It says the 104th General Assembly recognized that the appellate court, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7373)|
| 2:03:00| and specifically considering the open meeting law have unequivocally ruled that Tennessee Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7380)|
| 2:03:07| and so forth prevents proceeding and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| I mean, it's pretty clear there that it's not every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| And the Attorney General has basically upheld it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| Now, the law director would, you know, know the details, but the state has told me, you know, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| I don't mean to interrupt you, but Commissioner Hammond serves on the committee of the open meetings law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| He might be able to shed some light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| Yes, I was just going to say that this is still a work in progress with regards to the open meetings law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| We've had many meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| We've been meeting for over a year on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| And once the language is adopted by the full committee, which will take place November 27th and 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7428)|
| 2:03:55| I intend to bring it back to this body to let you know what the proposal is going to be to the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| Now, the General Assembly can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| They can do nothing with it, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| But basically, it was interesting to me that in our last meeting, Mr. Rick Hollow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| the attorney for the Tennessee Press Association, put forth a proposal, which I supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| which was, quote, quote, more than three, which would allow three people to gather information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:21| to talk and discuss, but not deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| So these proposals are on the table from the Press Association, from TCOG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| which is the government, the press people looking at this whole situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| They even realize that people need to be able to talk and gather information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| So this was their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| But the thing about the legislature is Mr. Leuthold is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| The legislature can exempt themselves every single year, and they don't have to be under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7486)|
| 2:04:52| And so that's why we're hopeful that as we gather together and put together a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| that the members of the General Assembly who are on the committee will look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| this is a good thing not only for school boards and city councils and utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| and hospital boards and county commissions, but it's also a good thing for the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| And the U.T. Board of Trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| I would like to say one thing, is that the commissioners, you as commissioners, as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| or a few of you, have indicated that it's stopping government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| Well, why would you want to enforce it on the state then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| I mean, it's going to make it much more difficult for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| I'm all for open meetings, don't get me wrong, or open government, transparent government, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| But I think it's much different, and I think you keep going back to the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7535)|
| 2:05:42| And I think you have to stand on that local level and work on the local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| and how it affects the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| You have to look at it differently in the state because you have a House, you have a Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| you have a veto power, and you have a large entity where they don't live close to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| So you can't say if it doesn't apply to the state, boy, gosh, we're not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| No, that's not what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| What we're saying is it's going to be applied to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| We're saying that they ought to apply it to themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| I would think that someone in your capacity would want to have not only transparent government locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7573)|
| 2:06:21| but transparent government at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| See, that's where all of, you know, county government is basically an extension of the state government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7584)|
| 2:06:32| And the powers that we derive come from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| And there are things that the state passes at the last minute that affect us locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:45| For instance, several years ago, in order for the state to balance their budget one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| they took the lowest class of felony and made it a high class misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7610)|
| 2:06:56| Now, that doesn't sound like a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| But what that did was is that instead of the person being incarcerated on the state's dime, it's now on the local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7619)|
| 2:07:08| And that shifted millions of dollars of the cost to local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| when we didn't have, we didn't even know it was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| So, I mean, the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| No one in Knox County or any other local government knew that that was coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| Now, what did that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| Well, what it did was it shifted the burden of proof from the homeowner to be annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7648)|
| 2:07:35| from the city to have the burden of proof on them, to the homeowner that's being annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7655)|
| 2:07:42| And it also took away their right to a jury trial when they get annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| Those are the types of legislation that can come down to the local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| affecting local people that the counties didn't have a chance to even voice their opinion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7673)|
| 2:08:03| because they did it without transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| And those are just a few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7688)|

| 2:08:34| because they have a closed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| I don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7717)|

| 2:08:54| But then he was proposing legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7734)|

| 2:11:50| We've been having problems with these dogs since they moved here in November 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7910)|
| 2:11:58| Everybody in the neighborhood has called animal control about these dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| and four years later we have no solution to this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| On February 17th, four of these dogs attacked our dog in our yard, seriously injuring her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7928)|
| 2:12:16| I had my vet call animal control, and I kept calling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| By April, the dangerous dogs would get one night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| and I called animal control again to see why nothing had been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| David Head told me based on the prior history with these dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| they would be deemed dangerous and they would be kept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| He said if they did not keep the dogs up to call animal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| I have called them repeatedly about these dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| All of these dogs have never been kept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| They are frequently getting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| The three adult males and one adult female and three children that live at 5807 are irresponsible owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:58| They have more dogs than the charter allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| They never try to stop the barking or clean up the poop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| This is a very stressful situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| A lot of these dogs are on very flimsy chains that they can break easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| This summer, a white whale was tied about five feet from the road with a raw outlet or belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| I called animal control since this dog was involved in the attack on my dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8000)|
| 2:13:26| None of the pens they have up are up to Knox County Code to hold dangerous dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| These dogs are so inbred, they are raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| From Friday evening until Monday morning, between 3 and 4, dogs are running out all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| There is a lot of barking, fighting, and commotion coming from over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| These dogs have pups. They keep them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| The pups have pups and it just goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| The week of October 22nd, while school was out for fall break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| those dangerous dogs were on my property fighting my dog through my fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:03| I called animal control and filed a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| On October 24th, I heard a lot of dog barking and it sounded like they were attacking something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:13| I looked that way and there was a worker taking one of their cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| After he got the car and left, animal control arrived at their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:22| Three of the dangerous dogs that they were supposed to keep up was that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8062)|
| 2:14:27| The woman of the family picked up the flimsy chains that were lying in the yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8067)|
| 2:14:31| and took the three dogs behind the fallen-down fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| In my opinion, animal control should have given them a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| It is like animal control gives them the blessing to keep the numerous dangerous dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| No one should have to endure for four years and go through what we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| On November the 7th, one of the dogs was inside my fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| I have pictures of it on my camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| I called animal control and David Head gave me the excuse they are doing all they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8099)|
| 2:15:06| I called Tim Adams and he said they would put their heads together and see if they could do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:13| Four years is unacceptable to have to put up with a problem like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| I think North County Animal Control is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| It seems like all they want to do is make excuses for not doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| I once called them because the dogs were making so much noise at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| and they told me to keep on calling the North County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| So I told him the other day the North County Sheriff's Department said it was the animal problem to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8136)|
| 2:15:42| So, anyway, that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| Ms. Carroll, what's your address again on that control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8145)|

| 2:15:53| Are the dogs running loose or are they pinned up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| Usually two or three are out at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| Some are pinned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| I guess there's about 30 or more of the dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| What's the name of that street, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8165)|

| 2:16:09| We'll call animal control again tomorrow morning for you and we'll make sure something's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8169)|
| 2:16:16| Okay. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| Mr. Law Director, you've got something you want to comment on about the charter, what it allows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8178)|
| 2:16:24| Well, in our code we certainly have an animal control ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| and we have been working with the city and the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:34| We have basically a committee that's formed with animal control persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8194)|
| 2:16:42| with law enforcement persons, with animal control activists that have been assimilated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:51| and we're trying to come up with new language that both the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| and the county can use to basically enforce a mirror ordinance, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8214)|
| 2:17:01| that more effectively deals with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| Still, the way the law is written now, ma'am, it ought to address your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:16| Okay. We'll try to take care of that tomorrow for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| Can we have something where she reports back to us if nothing is done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| I mean, could we say one week or right after Thanksgiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| or some type of reasonable time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| Because I'd like to have something where if nothing's happening that she is reporting back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8246)|
| 2:17:32| or report to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| If you would, just let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| I think Hugh Holt has some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| Gentlemen, in your package you were provided a copy of the new revised procurement manual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8263)|
| 2:17:49| or, excuse me, procurement card manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| The revisions were highlighted in yellow, and we're here for your comments, suggestions, recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8273)|
| 2:18:01| But I will say that we met with the procurement committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| or I did one-on-one with each of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| That's Mr. Leuthold, Mr. Hammond, and Mr. Lambert to go over these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| I'd like to hear what you've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| Hugh, I appreciate meeting with us, and I think from what I've looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| it looks like you've done a good job addressing some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| or most of the issues in tightening up so that we don't have misuse out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8304)|
| 2:18:32| and I appreciate you working hard on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| I agree with Mr. Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| I don't think it is possible to get any tighter than you have with this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8319)|
| 2:18:44| and still have a procurement card program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| And I think that it is as tough as it can possibly get without just cutting them all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8328)|
| 2:18:54| And I do believe that based on the rebate that we're getting back on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| based on how it streamlines their procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| I believe that it would be a bad thing if we ended the P-card program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| Ditto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| The other thing that Hugh pointed out is that, you know, by looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8349)|
| 2:19:13| by having this card and you get a chance to see where all these sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| small reoccurring expenses are coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| and we've actually been able to identify some things that we were just spending money on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8362)|
| 2:19:28| that we could actually, instead of doing a little bit here and a little bit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| we were actually able to go back and write a contract for the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| and actually save money because we were able to identify an expenditure that was reoccurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8378)|
| 2:19:45| and it was a good way to track our expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8385)|
| 2:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| I'm just going to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| As an old gun rights activist, P-cards don't make inappropriate charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| People make inappropriate charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| And I think that we've addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| and reprimanded the people that have made inappropriate charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| and I think that we've got that situation under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8409)|
| 2:20:15| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| I just want to thank Alice and Rogers at the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| They just got checked with the Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| Of course, I looked at them too and couldn't find anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| That's a good example of doing what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| But this three-strike policy, that needs to be a little bit more severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| What would you like to say, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Well, you've got the first offense will be just cause for a warning to the cardholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| The second offense will be just cause for a six- to eight-day suspension of the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| The third offense will be the cancellation of the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| Now, everybody should know on these cards they went to school or supposedly are supposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8448)|
| 2:20:54| but apparently Ms. Rogers did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| She must not have slept while she was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| But anyway, this thing, the second time, this card should be taken away from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| and they should be reprimanded some way by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| suspending them from work for three days or something like that without pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| Okay. I'll note that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| There needs to be something like Commissioner Lambert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| it's not the card that does the charging, it's the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| And what we were trying to accomplish there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| you have a lot of people who make a lot of transactions in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| And, in fact, we had over 19,000 transactions this year on the cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| and from time to time they may have inadvertently used the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| And we were trying to not overpunish an employee for inadvertently using the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8500)|
| 2:21:53| But, yeah, we can take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| You know, Commissioner Lambert talked there about what we had done to punish some of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8515)|
| 2:22:02| reprimand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| I don't know of anything we've done. Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| I've got a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| Well, now, we're still waiting on an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| I think we'll. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| Paul, if an offense is very gross and, you know, extreme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8535)|
| 2:22:24| we still reserve the right to discipline that employee much further than just that three strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8544)|
| 2:22:31| Yeah, up to termination. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| That's on the third strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| No, we can do that before that. We can do it on the first strike if it's that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| If it's an egregious charge or it obviously is in violation of the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| we can take personnel action immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| Well, we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| I mean, if it's fraud, we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| Yeah, that's. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8571)|
| 2:22:52| I agree, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8572)|
| 2:22:53| . . on these other cards if they were misused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| People going out and buying clothes on them and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8574)|
| 2:22:59| And I'm sure that, you know, if you gave me one of those cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| I'd know what I could use it for if I went to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8589)|
| 2:23:10| Jim McEvers, 12630 Early Drive, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:16| I have to admit, in reading the reports in the new Sentinel on these P cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| I have been just absolutely astounded that something could get this far out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8601)|
| 2:23:27| When the people that were given the cards, I would hope it was explained to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8607)|
| 2:23:35| what they could use it for and that they would be given to responsible individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:42| My previous employer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| I had an American Express card that was a corporate American Express card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| and I traveled to a lot of places with it, and I was given $52 a day to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8630)|
| 2:23:57| And that was my per diem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| If I put charges on that American Express card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| and I came back and couldn't justify them on my travel, I ate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| There wasn't any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| I mean, when I put my receipts and stuff, that was a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| The lab issued a credit card system throughout the laboratory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| and I, as a group leader, I didn't have one, but one of my weekly employees had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8654)|
| 2:24:20| And it wasn't up to me to audit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| The gentleman that had it knew what it could be used for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| and it was very handy when we were trying to buy a lot of equipment to send to Russia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8667)|
| 2:24:33| People knew they did not fill up their cars with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| They didn't buy clothes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| It was, like I said, when I started reading this in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| I thought, who in the world is watching these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| And what kind of people were given cards and turned loose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8687)|
| 2:24:51| I also, I know the audit is still going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| but I also am trying to figure out why people are buying personal clothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| police officers and uniforms and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| I can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| I never, even when I was in a foreign country and I needed a shirt, I could not put that shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| I had to pay for my own laundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| I don't get some of this, the charges that are allowed on this card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8713)|
| 2:25:19| So thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| Hugh, I'd like to ask you one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| Are they still charging gas with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| In fact, the majority of the cards under the mayor's office were cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8737)|
| 2:25:44| There were some that had been reissued to our field people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| but there is not a card that will allow that type of access under the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8747)|
| 2:25:53| Well, I'm talking about people with furnishing cards, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| Like let's just use the mayor, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| How does he get his gas now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| You have a gas card, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| That's the way most county employees have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| But do you have anything put in for the miles to be logged in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| and out like the sheriff's department has to keep these people from filling up the civilian card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8772)|
| 2:26:17| The pilot card is a separate program from this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| and it is through the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| and they're supposed to follow certain county procedures when they're using that card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8784)|
| 2:26:31| I know, you know, if the sheriff's department car pulls in, they have to log the miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| That is put in effect now for these other people, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| That's what's supposed to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| We want it to happen because we don't want them driving their personal car in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| if we don't have any record to keep up with it in charging gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8804)|
| 2:26:48| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| When a person pulls in their county vehicle and uses their pilot charge card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8815)|
| 2:27:02| do they log the license plate number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:07| I would think at the very least they should log the license plate number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| Yeah, that's what they're supposed to be doing is logging the license plate number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| and, if I'm not mistaken, also the county tab number on the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| Probably the miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:21| And the mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8841)|
| 2:27:22| Yeah, I just want to make sure we've got something in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| I do want to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| I appreciate these reports we get every month showing how these things are being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| I think that's another safeguard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| And moving forward, in the procurement card manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8855)|
| 2:27:40| we are separating the general purchase from the travel piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| and there will be cards issued for those who have a need for travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| and that will be accounted for separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| And, again, that's one of the recommendations of the Mayor's P-Card Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| and one of the recommendations of the internal audit and our Senior Director of Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8878)|
| 2:28:05| What kind of safeguards have you put in about eating here in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| They have to follow the Knox County travel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| That means they can no longer eat with a P-Card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| Food has been turned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8894)|
| 2:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| We're going to have a lot of skinny people around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| We've got some people that need to get to work in the morning at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| Well, I just want to ask something real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| I remember a few months ago, Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| did you ask that we start getting reports on travel on Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8913)|
| 2:28:42| I had asked that we, I believe we passed a resolution about the monthly P-Card statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| which we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| As far as travel, I don't remember any specific, because the travel is on the P-Cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:53| Travel is on the P-Card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| Hugh, are you separating the travel on the, or are we getting that in our report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8934)|
| 2:29:00| Yeah, we'll have a travel card moving forward as soon as I get the proper signatures on this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8940)|
| 2:29:07| which includes Mr. Owings, the mayor, and Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| And we'll be getting those reports as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| Yes, you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8953)|
| 2:29:14| They'll be separate from the standard P-Card charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| On the reservations on these travel cards, when you get them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| will that be the supervisor that makes those reservations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| Yes, it'll be the department head that determines that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| And, of course, they still have to fill out the tiers, the travel reimbursement forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| And, again, with this card, just like with the P-Card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| there's going to be four levels of accountability when you make a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| They're going to be on per diem just like the rest of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| Sounds to me like you're putting in some safeguards now that have been followed a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8988)|
| 2:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8993)|
| 2:29:54| If we have nothing else, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-2?start=8994)|
