| 0:00:00| Welcome, everyone, to the March 5th, 2024 Agenda Review Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| At this time, I will turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| Take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=34)|
| 0:00:39| I just have a few minor updates to share with you this morning before we get into our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| Just so you all are aware, we have submitted our budget and work program requests to both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| the city and county for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| I will keep you updated as those reviews progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=51)|
| 0:00:56| I also wanted to share with you that there has been a slight change in how we will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| reviewing right-of-way closures for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=61)|
| 0:01:05| So as the county does, the county takes their right-of-way closures directly to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| and city will also be taking a similar path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| Staff will still be involved in the intake of all those applications, the processing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| of those applications, and assisting city engineering with the administration and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| providing our comments as part of the process, but those will go directly to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| That was effective March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| We have hired a new planner, which I'm really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| This person won't be starting for a little while, will be a recent graduate, but he will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| be joining the transportation group in early summer, and I look forward to introducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| you to him at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| We are currently recruiting for a new communications assistant and hope to make an offer soon on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| And so with that, I'm going to introduce our guest speaker today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| John Livengood is a transportation engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| He focuses on active transportation infrastructure for the city of Knoxville and he has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| for the city of Knoxville engineering department for 17 years and in his current position as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| alternative transportation engineer for the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| He has a bachelor of science in civil engineering from the University of Tennessee, and he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| going to be sharing with you an overview of the city's recently awarded grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| under the Safe Streets for All program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Thanks, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=145)|
| 0:02:41| Hello, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| Yeah, so I'm going to speak about the Safe Streets for All grant that the city recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| A little background, back in 2023, Knox Planning and the city worked together with some community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:03:00| stakeholders and we produced two Vision Zero plans, one for the area and one for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=180)|
| 0:03:11| And those were completed in June of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| And then the city then applied for a Safe Streets for All grant in July 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| This past December, the city was awarded an $8 million grant, so that's for $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| So I'm going to go a little over what our grant entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| We are doing studies and we are also using the grant funds for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| So as far as studies, we are going to do a speed management plan and our study identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=223)|
| 0:03:52| high injury networks throughout the city, so that's roadways that have excessive number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| of crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| So the speed management plans is going to look at all those high injury networks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| make speed recommendations on those roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| We are also going to update our bike facilities plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| The city had a bike facilities plan created in 2015 and we have made a lot of progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=254)|
| 0:04:22| with bike facilities, but it's time to update the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| Thinking has changed a little, so now we're going to focus a lot more on protected bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| lanes in this plan, where the previous one was really just about trying to build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| an initial network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| This update should really focus on making an all-ages network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| Also really looking at intersections, because that's where most crashes occur between motor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| vehicles and cyclists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| The funding also is going to help or allow the city to create a reporting dashboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:05:01| This will allow the public to keep up with the projects the city is implementing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| Vision Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| The dashboard is also going to have some behind-the-scenes features that allow city engineering to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| advanced analytics on crash data, so we can better target projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=317)|
| 0:05:26| We are also going to be doing what is called feasibility studies in the grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=326)|
| 0:05:35| What this is really doing is looking for quick build projects at intersections, so not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| It might be re-styping projects, it might be flexible bollard projects, something we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| can implement very quick to improve safety at intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| We are also going to look at intersection studies for inclusion of left turn arrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| Our study identified left turns at intersections as one of the highest crash causes, so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:09| going to look at where we can add arrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| We are also going to continue with stakeholder engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| We realize that we can construct all we want, but it also comes down strictly to driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| behavior, so there is going to be a large outreach component with this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| As far as construction, we have three different projects we are going to be working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| On Magnolia Avenue, we are going to do some crossing improvements at three different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| As you may be aware, Magnolia Avenue has large bike lanes and parking on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| It is a five-lane section, so it is an extremely long stretch for pedestrians to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| Signalized intersections are far apart, and we have a lot of pedestrians trying to cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| We are going to look at three intersections, and whether it is pedestrian refuges, rapid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| flashing beacons, or shortening the crossings at each of those intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=436)|
| 0:07:25| We are also using the grant to fund our Broadway streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| This is currently in design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| This project is completing a missing link in our first creek greenway in North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| so directly in front of the Kroger on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| There is a greenway on either side, and this project will fund the construction of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| We are hoping to go to construction next summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| The final project this grant is going to fund is our Woodland Complete Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| This is in the same area on Woodland Avenue right by Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| Currently it is a four-lane roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| The project is going to road diet this road to a three-lane section, it is going to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| a greenway extending off the first greenway that connects to the bike lanes on Woodland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| and it is going to extend a sidewalk and do crossing improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| So we think that will have significant safety impacts, especially being near Kroger, also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| adjacent to the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| That pretty much covers what our grant is going to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| I've got a question about the separated bike lanes or the flexible bollards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| I've noticed on Fifth Avenue and Broadway where those are installed, I guess the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| street sweepers can't get to the curb to sweep that lane, and I think we've got some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| of miniature sweeper, perhaps that's just for the CBID area, but the ongoing maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| and cleaning of the separated bike lanes, is that something that's in part of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| or capable to be used to grant money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| The mini-sweeper that Citi bought last year or the year before, that was for active transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| I mean, it's used a lot in the CBID and Market Square, but it was specifically funded for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| active transportation, so protected bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| I believe that should be able to fit behind the protection on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| We've had a lot of construction out there, CARM has been working on a driveway, so there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| is a little more construction mess on that street, but we should be able to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=594)|
| 0:10:04| it with that sweeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Okay, if there's nothing else, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| I've got a question, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| This is just in your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| When we're reviewing the agenda items, what should we as planners keep in mind to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| promote walkability, good walkability within the city of Knoxville that would be the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| impactful for you and to increase walkability in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=629)|
| 0:10:38| Of course sidewalks, but I think safe crossing is, crossings of the roadways are really the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| most important, and I don't know if that's what you all would get into, but you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=646)|
| 0:10:56| at corner radiuses, if you have this gigantic corner radius, it's going to make the crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| much longer and it's going to allow vehicles to go around the corner a lot faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| I think anything with ball bouts, I think pressing of signals, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| Wide sidewalks are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Protected bike lanes around sidewalks makes people walking feel much safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| Minimizing driveways, keeping the sidewalk level through the driveway rather than lowering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=684)|

| 0:12:03| to pedestrians, often you have a parking lot between the sidewalk and the front door and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| the pedestrian has a very hostile area to walk through to actually get to a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| Those are a few things I can think of offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| Just one quick, and you may have already answered this, John, but so how much is the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| $8 million, so it has a 20% match, so we're doing $10 million of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| And is it all available in 2024 or is it spaced out over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| It is available in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| The projects, I believe, have a five-year time period to build them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| The city already had funding for the construction of the Broadway Greenway in the Woodland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:56| and so we are using some of that money that was set aside for construction to cover the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| match amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=782)|

| 0:14:04| Okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| There's the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| We'll look at the relationships, the plan relationships, kind of review our comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| plan and implementation, and then Amy will go over drafts that are all on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| First we have a new document, and I think you have it in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| It just shows our plan relationships, where we are currently at, which is the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| and then we have our general plan supported by sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| We are trying to move to the growth plan with our comprehensive plan supported by small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| area plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| One thing that we heard is Knox County really likes their individual communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| The Troto area, Halls, Powell, those are very special to the residents of Knox County, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| we can supplement our comprehensive plan with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| This is the process that we have taken, and most of you have been here throughout it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=898)|

| 0:15:13| This is a slide that you've seen too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| It just shows a comprehensive view of what we were trying to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| One thing that I like to point out here is that unified strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| If you look at our policies and actions within the comprehensive plan, you'll see that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| are a lot of community partners listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| We have the Chamber, we have Legacy Parks, we have Planning, Engineering, and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| So we are trying to look at this plan unified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Who all was involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| This is added in here to remember some of the loudest voices that we're hearing right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| now have been a part of this process the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| We had members on the advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| We had technical committee experts, stakeholders, members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| All of our legislative bodies have been involved during the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Public engagement, I just want to point out during round one, we had over 400 participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| online and in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Round two, which was a very important part of this process because it was choosing our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| preferred scenario of how we're going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| We had over 4,000 people involved in person and online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=984)|

| 0:16:33| Next, we'll go into our comprehensive plan, just do a high level review of what you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| see in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| This is the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| It is on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| There's also an interactive map on the website that you can go and zoom in, parcel-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| streets, so you can see the place types around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| I'll hand it off to Jim Snowden and he will focus on the transportation aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you, Mandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| This obviously, as Amy has mentioned several times, is the first time the county has ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| had a comprehensive plan that included the alignment of transportation projects as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| as land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| One of the things that we heard early on from the mayor and the county commissioners as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| well as you guys and the public was that our transportation network was reactive to development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| and that's something that we need to be better about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| That's what this plan is really focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| We wanted to align our capital projects with growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| You'll see one of the next slides we'll talk about talks about the growth that we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| in Hardin Valley is going to be supported by a very large infrastructure project in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Some of the other small area studies we'll talk about will support in future fiscal years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| the growth in the other parts of the county that are expanded in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| Some of the other things we want to do is implement ways in which we can allow more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| walkable development, allow more town center development, as well as just provide redundancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| in the transportation network that realistically we don't have in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| So we're kind of learning from some of our mistakes in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Next slide please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| And speaking to really putting the money where it's most needed, obviously anybody that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| strove through Hardin Valley know it has a lot of challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| We're going to invest six and a half million dollars in the fiscal year upcoming to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| We're going to partner with TDOT that is working on a new interchange at Watt Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| at I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| We're going to expand Everett Road north into the west side of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| That project was identified as part of the Hardin Valley mobility study that was completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| That project will include a four-lane median divided facility kind of along, kind of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| the I guess the bulk and quarry is if people know where that is, and kind of extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| up through Buttermilk and into Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| And then we're also going to work on expanding existing Hardin Valley, the improved section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| the curb and gutter section of this three-lane to bump out some curbs, add additional capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| there as well as provide additional capacity, potentially a four-lane median divided west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| of Steel Road to really allow for, if you'll notice in the plan, a lot of different types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| of growth that we're proposing in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| So we want to be very conscious to have that transportation improvement in advance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| One of the other things we're going to do, I'm sorry, go back one slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| There's also going to be some $500,000 that we had in this upcoming budget as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| $500,000 in the current budget, fiscal year 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| We're going to do some small area studies, some of the growth that we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| I guess the next biggest area of growth is in the RITA community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| Obviously there's some concerns with the roads in those areas and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| So we want to do and embark upon, hopefully in the next 60 to 90 days, really an East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| Knox County mobility study so that we can identify projects, capacity, safety, and pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| projects that need to support that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| And then fiscal year 26, you'll start to see projects like we have at Hardin Valley at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| Edbert in East Knoxville to support that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| So that as that development occurs over the next 20 years, those transportation improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| One of the other things that you heard, this body heard, I think a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| was some of the challenges in transportation in the Choteau Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| That's something that we're going to do a little deeper dive in and do an area study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| down there to look at how to provide redundant routes north and south and east and west in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Because you have, as Commissioner Levinson knows very much, you have North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| running east and west and Choteau-Harvey running north and south, and that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| So we need to improve upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| We're also going to look in areas where the plan's proposing additional growth in South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| Knoxville and along Straw Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| So those are things that we have upcoming that we want to be very intentional about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| Next slide, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| And this is just a map overlaid of all the transportation projects that were considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| as part of the plan that you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| We kind of identified really four main projects or types of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| We had safety projects, obviously, intersection improvements, shoulder improvements, things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Capacity projects, which include those, you know, taking a two-lane to a four-lane, adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| turn lanes, adding signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| We also want to look at modernization, which is taking a lot of our, you know, two-lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| roads that probably are okay in alignment, just need improved shoulders and need some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| safety enhancements for the growing traffic in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| And then lastly, obviously, one of the things we heard a lot about was multimodal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| We want to make sure, just like Mr. Livengood was saying, that pedestrians and bicyclists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| have safe and accommodating facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| We're in the process of letting Canton-Holler Road here in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| That project will make that road safer, but also it has a sidewalk on one side and a ten-foot-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| greenway on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| So as part of our capital projects, we always look to those things to make sure that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| One of the other things that we wanted to do as part of this plan that we have never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| done before is have a parks component, and that's where I'll turn it over to Kathy Olson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| and she'll go through the analysis that was completed for the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| Thanks, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| So some of you may be aware of a companion plan that was undertaken with Kimley Horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| the same consultant that did our comprehensive plan with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| It was the System-Wide Parks and Recreation Master Plan, and it looked at the provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| of facilities and recreational opportunities through our current offering of parks here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| So it was looking and comparing what we offer in Knox County against the National Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| and Parks Association standards to really look at and make sure whether we have enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| lacrosse fields, basketball courts, pickleball courts, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| So it wasn't as much concerned with locating areas that we need to provide new parks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:34| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| So instead, what we did as part of this comprehensive land use plan, on page 22 of your document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| when you have time, is we looked at kind of that horizon year land use layout, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| represented by the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| We looked at the place types that represented areas where there would be residential developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| So we were looking at suburban residential, mixed-use town centers, places where families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| would be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| We laid that out against where we currently have park and recreational opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| And we said, how far away are these locations from existing park opportunities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| Are they outside of a one-mile walking distance or a one-mile street buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| And we shaded those on a map that you'll see on page 22 as a park desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| So I want you to remember that this is looking forward to the horizon year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| If development occurs the way we expect it to, and we do not provide any additional parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| opportunities, these areas would be in what we would term a parks desert based on a one-mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| walking distance standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Now that doesn't give us a lot to go on in terms of priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| So what we did was we supplemented this analysis with another map, which we labeled priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1492)|
| 0:25:00| areas for park investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| So knowing that development isn't going to look like the future land use map overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| it's going to take about 20 years for us to kind of get to that build-out stage, we looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| at where there are current dense addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| So that gives us kind of an analysis of, okay, where are we currently experiencing park deserts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| based on our existing development patterns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| And these are the areas that pop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| So what this does is it gives us a kind of pathway forward to where we might want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| prioritize investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| We can also look to that future land use map and the park deserts to anticipate where future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| growth might occur, and we might be able to purchase land at a cheaper price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| So between those two things, between those two analyses, we get what we need in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| to go after additional funding opportunities and locate those new parks areas in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1550)|
| 0:25:58| with where we think development will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Do you mind just going back to the last slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| So because neither of these plans, neither the parks analysis that we did in the comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| plan, nor the system-wide Parks and Recreation Master Plan have superseded in terms of scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| the existing plans, the 2009 Parks Plan and the 2020 Corridor Greenway Feasibility Study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| Plan, those are still in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| So we will still be referencing those as we go through and assess development and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| for opportunities to partner with developers to provide some of those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:40| And I think we're on to implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Oh, sorry, fiscal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| I'll speak briefly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| You guys have seen this, I think, slide several times, so I won't belabor it too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| But one of the things that Mayor Jacobs and the Commission really tasked us with was making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| this plan and our growth over the next 20 years to be fiscally responsible and sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| So we had a sub-consultant of Kimberley Horn, NITIGRID, that did a lot of analysis with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| this, looking at expected tax revenues associated with these new types of growth, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| the cost to serve, resulting in a fiscal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| What we determined or what we found out is that essentially the growth, I guess the procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| that we currently have in place are not really financially viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| They're putting us in a situation where about $2 million in an annual deficit, whereas the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| preferred scenario with all the different types of place types that's codified in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| plan will allow for a lot of different types of development that is within the county that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| ultimately gives us almost a $5 million net or surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| So the net of that's about $7 million that would be received by the county annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| So that was essentially checking that box that the mayor wanted us to really look closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| at to make sure that one of his things was big fiscal responsibilities, so we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| to make sure that that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| So that box was checked, and I just wanted to make one last mention of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| I think the next slide, as Kathy mentioned, is implementation, and Ms. Brooks will discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| So implementation starts on chapter three of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| It starts on page 51, and I just want to make note of there's 26 pages of this plan devoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| to implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| That was very intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| I'm not going to review each item with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| We reviewed many of them with you during your workshop, and hopefully you've had a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| to review them since the plan's been posted since October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| But I just want to reiterate that the goal is really to make this a plan that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| sit on a shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| That's often a critique of our planning efforts, not just here locally, but across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| So it's very intentional that we want to make sure that this is a plan that is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| help move Knox County forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| So the plan is the basis for all public and private decisions that are made related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| land use and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| So this is meant to inform work programs, approvals that you all recommend going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| county commission on a monthly basis, capital improvement projects, economic incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| Our proposed work program, for example, assuming adoption of this plan, includes 23 new items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| associated with implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| So we're already thinking ahead to what that's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| As Madie mentioned earlier, there's a number of entities that this plan is intended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| engage and help inform their efforts, not just us here at Planning and Engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| Public Works, but Parks and Recreation, the Health Department, Knox Heritage, the Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| Planning Organization, Legacy Parks, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| So the plan incorporates an implementation and maintenance schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| Plan amendments will be considered on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| We will provide an annual assessment of the plan to this body as well as county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| There will be an annual assessment of the plan that will be provided to this body and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:27| then forwarded on to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Some of the things that we'll look at is the number of plan amendments that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| requested, any trends in development that we're seeing, any challenges that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| identified with the plan itself, and recommendations that we might have to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| And then every five years, the plan will be reviewed for more major updates, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| it will be based off of that annual assessment I just mentioned, and then a major update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| will be required every 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Question there real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Just to clarify, in dovetail on REACH, but it's able to be requested to be changed every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| quarterly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Yes, and that is a change from what we presented at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| I think that's much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| So Appendix H includes a matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| This is similar to the Laney's Classifications Table that we use and have used for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| This will guide the review of applications during the interim period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| So now I really want to get into some of the plan revisions that we've incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| I just want to make note that this plan has been adopted, I mean, it has been posted since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| October 2023, and we have been continually to take feedback and trying to be as responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| So I want to start with Chapter 2, the framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| We've updated primary and secondary modes in the mixed-use districts to clarify primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| versus secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| That was a comment and a question that came up during your workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| We've added additional information to the description of several place types to specify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| We've added a new rural agricultural place type specifically focused on farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| We've also provided additional clarification to criteria for the placement of new business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| parks and connectivity expected in the corridor mixed-use place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| We've also added a new area for future study that Jim has already touched on in the Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| Peninsula area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Chapter 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| I have several slides associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Again, this is a major focus of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| So we've added Knox County Schools as a partner to engage in 9.1, and we've added a new action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| item specific to annual coordination between the county planning and Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| This was also some feedback that we received during the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| We've changed the plan amendment request schedule from annually to quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| I just mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| We've added a reference to preserving natural heritage to action 7.1, added additional criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| to be considered as part of a new historic resources inventory, and that can be found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| in action 8.4, and a new demolition delay option for historically significant properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| in the county has been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| We've added a requirement for training to be provided to elected and appointed officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| related to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| We've strengthened the language of action 2.4 to encourage preservation of open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| added an application requirement for applicants to reference the adopted comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| and their request for any plan amendments, and added additional language to better articulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| the requirement of land use decisions to be consistent if this plan is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| We've strengthened the criteria for a plan amendment update beyond an error in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| to require a meeting of two of the criteria, and I'll go over that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| So that can be found here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| So this is on page 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2047)|
| 0:34:16| It's in the blue box on the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| We received quite a bit of feedback related to the plan amendment criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| So an obvious or significant error or omission in the plan would be justification to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| the plan, and then otherwise, it would require two or more of the following criteria that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| listed, those items one through four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2079)|
| 0:34:50| If we could go to the next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| I'm just wondering if we've missed a slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| So just to clarify that currently, it requires one versus two criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| So that is a change to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Okay, Appendix H. I already touched on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| We have updated the place type and correspondence matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Those updates include adding the rural agricultural place type that I mentioned, distinguishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| between densities allowed in the plan residential zone, and then providing additional clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| on how this matrix will be used to inform the decisions that you all will make on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| monthly basis as well as county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| And it's really not a change in practice on how we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| It's just putting it into writing, like how we will evaluate requests for plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2148)|
| 0:35:57| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| I want to just talk about next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| You can click to the next one, Whitney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| So you all will consider this for recommendation to county commission on March 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| County commission would like to have a workshop, so they've scheduled that for March 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| and then they will consider your recommendation on March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| Are there any questions for the team right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2178)|
| 0:36:26| Can you elaborate, Amy, on what the changes were for the Choteau Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| I know that Jim had mentioned the fact that you all are going to do the assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| What else was included in here for Choteau Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| Well, there's a couple of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| We've got an existing project down there where we're going to do some modernization along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| North Shore Drive, including adding the lanes now are probably 10 to 11 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| We're going to make them consistent 11 foot as well as add a two foot wide paved shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| and put safe slopes along the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| A lot of areas have pretty steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| But in addition to that, we also are going to do essentially an area-wide study to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| additional projects above and beyond that that would then show up in a future fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| year request for improvements, like maybe potentially long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| I mean, ideally, it'd be great to get rid of that one lane underpass down there at Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Obviously, that's a multi-million dollar project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| That study would identify things and we'd be able to look for some grants and different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| funding sources to try to find some of those larger projects funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| Oh, yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Mandy reminded me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| One of the things we did do, there's some vacant parcels down there that are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| We did, I think originally we had them as an SR placetype.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| We have converted that now to a rural living placetype to just allow for the preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| of that area until such time this study and some of these improvements can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2284)|

| 0:39:32| the level of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| The requested density was out of character with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| However, the requested HDR land use was approved and the PR zone with up to 18 was also approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2377)|
| 0:39:46| The Outlet Drive to Snyder Road extension has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2386)|

| 0:40:01| This infrastructure makes medium density appropriate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| Densities more than 12 dwelling units an acre would be out of character with the immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2405)|

| 0:40:22| MDRO is slightly more intensive than MDR and allows more uses and densities higher than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2422)|

| 0:41:01| However, the growth policy plan and comp plan have not yet been adopted so this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2461)|

| 0:41:49| At the existing density of 12 dwelling units an acre on this property, a maximum of 218| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2509)|

| 0:42:08| There's a small section of hillside protection on the property up in the northwest corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| There are also some closed contours on the site which indicate the potential presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2534)|

| 0:42:20| These environmental challenges make the current zoning of PRF-212 an appropriate zone for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| the property since they would be clustered together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| The recommendation is to deny the sector plan amendment to MDRO because it's not warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| with the current PR residential up to 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| The hillside protection would be retained and to deny the OB zone because it's inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| with the surrounding area and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| Miss Warner, the property right next to it that has a condition, do you know what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| condition was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Yeah, it's that they would only have access to outlet drive and not to Snyder Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| I mean, the other question I had, I mean, you mentioned that, so with our unpassed comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2591)|
| 0:43:24| land use and transportation plan, how do you think this request would fit into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2604)|
| 0:43:33| if this were to be in front of us if that were passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| Well, we didn't look at that comprehensively, but the OB zone is one of those on that matrix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:45| that we were talking about where it says it could be partially related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| So it could potentially be considered, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Whitney, I've got a question too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| So generally, I guess we certainly want to buffer residential from higher density type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| uses, but is office, whatever type of office zoning, is it not generally considered a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| between higher uses and residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| Yeah, the office zone is pretty similar to medium density residential in terms of buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| I guess my question would be, I mean, if an applicant came in and applied to build an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| office complex there or something like that, would staff be comfortable with that or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| it in an office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| I mean, as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I mean, because I've always viewed office as a type of a buffer between whatever it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| could be, commercial or a higher density residential and lower density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| So I guess I'm just trying to get my mind around the MDRO versus MDR hang up in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:45:01| Just kind of thinking out loud, but I don't really have a problem with the MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| I think it's still a buffer coming between the higher density at 18 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| I get that staff's trying to be consistent too, because the history I recall on it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| I think staff recommended against what you'd mentioned on the 18 units, but county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| thought it was still a good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| So the precedent's been set to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| So I mean, I'm just not opposed to the MDRO, I guess is what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| Yeah, I've got one comment here too that I'm trying to wrestle with a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| I was a part of a lot of group that developed the eastern part of this main road with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2741)|
| 0:45:50| bunch of office warehouse and really between Lovell Road and Campbell Station, that new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| road was connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| I think Sam Furrow did it back in the day and there was even a conversation about doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| a bridge over from Turkey Creek to outlets to really have that whole parallel part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2764)|
| 0:46:13| Turkey Creek and Outlets Drive function as a real heavily used commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2773)|
| 0:46:22| So as you look at all the office warehouse east and you look at Topgolf and I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| a boat dealership across the street, one of the largest RV dealerships around with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2788)|
| 0:46:35| Lazy Days and I'm not deliberating here, I guess where I'm going with this too, Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| has decided that they're not going to allow any more apartment development in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| I think they've identified pieces of property that they'll allow for apartment use, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| And so as that becomes one of the most growing, fastest growing parts of our county to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| allow density on really what I would, or office, on a commercial corridor doesn't quite resonate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2824)|
| 0:47:14| with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| And I think that the lay of the land here is a little unique in that all of these subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| that we're looking at do not access outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| They go out a different way and they just happen to be backing up to this commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| corridor that was built by Knox County and Farragut and really a lot of folks that thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| that this ought to be a sales tax grab area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| So I'm a little torn on how that played out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2859)|
| 0:47:50| Whitney, my question is about the, you said that the proposed density would allow it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2870)|
| 0:47:58| go up to 24, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| So the OB zone, through use on review, can go through up to 24 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| By right, up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| So hearing you speak about the case made me look at this from not the, excuse me, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| how the property faces the road, but how it's bracketed between two existing developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| So it seemed like the rationale was if it would allow 12 by right and up to 24 by special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Did I get it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| It would potentially allow up to 24 abutting single family residents there, which really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| wouldn't be a sort of transition from one to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| It would be putting a higher density in between to lower, which seems problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=2942)|

| 1:02:44| I do have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| I remember back in the day when the hillside protection plan was adopted, correct me if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| I'm wrong, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| It's a shall in the city of Knoxville, but it's a should, so you guys review that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| But the document doesn't specifically say that they have to abide by the hillside and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| ridge slope in the county only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| It's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| So the legislative body in the county did not adopt the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| So we use it as advisory to inform our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3796)|

| 1:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| And then moving forward with the new comprehensive plan that we've been talking about looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| at, is there any language in there that requires that to or not require it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| To follow the hillside and ridge slope plan in the unincorporated areas of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| No, it's something that this body could introduce, but it would take legislative action to adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| it officially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3824)|

| 1:03:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| I do have a quick question about the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| I'm not familiar with that as a part of that river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| Can somebody enlighten me as to, it's just literally from the bridge, I guess, on Soloway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| Bridge on that section, because there's other development further down the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3848)|
| 1:04:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| There's three different classes of the scenic river designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| This is a class three, which is partially developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| And the 450-foot buffer is specific to the class three designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| And the kinds of amenities that are highlighted in the Clinch River designation is kayaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3869)|
| 1:04:37| canoeing, and fishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| So it's highlighted statewide for those amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| Commissioner, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| Not really, because Director Snowden and I are looking at each other, and both of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| seem somewhat puzzled, because I've never heard of it, and it doesn't look like he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3896)|

| 1:04:58| So is this, and I'm not denying that it's not out there, is this a part of our package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3898)|

| 1:05:54| a little unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3954)|

| 1:06:06| This is guidance from a statewide program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3966)|

| 1:06:31| Did you say there was water, but no sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| There is no sanitary sewer service along West Gallaher Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| That is indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| With respect to the sewer, too, and I only say this because I developed covered bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4007)|

| 1:07:01| That was nearly 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| But theoretically, I mean, I would think you could pressure it up and go along the A lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4023)|

| 1:08:55| The most recent of which included a request for parking lot expansion in anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| of a sanctuary building expansion, which is shown here to provide a total of 1,700 seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| A condition for approval at that time was that the highlighted section of the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| lot not be accessible until the church was expanded so as not to affect the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4152)|

| 1:09:44| church building are not within the scope of this special use request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4184)|

| 1:10:23| Staff are recommending approval of the special use request subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| The applicant is contesting one of those conditions which have since been revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| I misread how the disturbance was reflected on the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| It appeared that the proposed development added 0.8 acres to a disturbance that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| already several acres over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| After further review, it appears it is slightly below that 14-acre disturbance budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| threshold by about a half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| The condition has been changed to say that any future disturbance in excess of what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| permitted in the hillside protection overlay shall require a Level 2 review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| This condition would typically be standard procedure, but it is applied here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| this property does exist in a gray zone with its previously approved planned district status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| from a time when the hillside protection overlay did not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| Per the transition rules, if the property owner chose to develop this property exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| as it was approved under the RP-1 district back in 1988, that would be permitted by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| and the current zoning regulations may not be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| But since this is coming through special use, which is beholden to current adopted plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| the hillside protection overlay is being applied and enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| That is being clarified with this condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| The applicant is contesting this condition as it was previously written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| but they may contest it still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| They provided email correspondence from a prior planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| indicating that the property may be exempt from the hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| because there was a grading permit previously issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| However, I looked into the scope of that grading permit and it was limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| parking expansion and a gazebo, which was never built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| The entire lot was not issued a grading permit and the entire lot is not exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| from the hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Article 8.9's applicability standards do leave room for misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| and perhaps that should be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| But it is logical to conclude that a minor grading permit on a 40-acre site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| does not render the entire site exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| This case has also been controversial with concern being expressed by neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| about the impact of a driveway to Topside Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| which is a narrow minor collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| However, we do recommend approval because of the need for this driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| due to safety and traffic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| The traffic study did not indicate a significant impact to Topside Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| and in theory, if Masterson Road were to remain as a public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| it could be redeveloped and a private driveway is likely more desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| for the surrounding community than a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Happy to answer any questions about this complicated one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| Has there been any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Originally when it was approved, it looked like they were going to limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| access to Sundays and one day during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| Is that still under consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| Their main service hours are not at peak traffic times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| and due to the concern about emergency access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| it seemed inappropriate to gate it when there may be a need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| Jessie, can you clarify the condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| then the non-condition, and then the condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| You did so, but I saw the letter from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| and I just want to make sure that I'm tracking correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| that originally there was a condition in the materials that we read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| Yeah, it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| It's as written there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| The way it was written before was that any future special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| would require a Level 2 and that was because at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| I thought they were already exceeding the disturbance budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| So here it clarifies that if it exceeds the disturbance budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| it would require a Level 2 hillside protection review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| So it's not any future, it's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| If it exceeds the disturbance budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| it would require a Level 2 hillside protection review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| So it's not any future, it's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| If it exceeds that disturbance budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4460)|
| 1:14:30| Seeing no other questions, we will move on to agenda item 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| which is the one-year plan for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| This is our draft 2024 one-year plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| There weren't any major overhauls done, however, there was some cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| So in Chapter 2, we are proposing to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| the agricultural conservation and rural residential land use types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| because they have identical recommended zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| as the agricultural land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| which is the more widely used land use classification in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| There is only one property with the agricultural conservation class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| and one property with the rural residential class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| in the entire city jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| and both properties meet the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| and location criteria of the agricultural class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| So we are proposing having these land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| amended to agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| which would have no material impact on the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Chapter 2 and the Appendix B Land Use Index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| have been made virtually identical to ensure completeness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| with regards to intent and location criteria in both references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| The Chapter 2 text was given priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| but there were some items in the Land Use Index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| that may have been missing from Chapter 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| and those were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| Text was only removed if it was redundant, inaccurate, or excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| Those are subjective terms, so I'll provide some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Redundant meaning there were repeated references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| to the type of street classification a land use could access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| or multiple references to utility access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Inaccurate, one inaccuracy we caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| was the general commercial land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| made reference to how a limited range of warehousing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| and wholesale activities may be permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| but those actually aren't permitted in any of the zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4578)|

| 1:16:23| because it's considered more of an industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| And then there were just some superfluous details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| such as regional commercial mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| a 400,000 square foot typical building envelope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| which was highly specific and maybe unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| The only meaningful change to a land use type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| was to low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| which specified that slopes must be less than 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| However, that's not really how this land use is applied in practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| and single-family dwellings in combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| with the enforcement of the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| is one of the least intensive development types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| that's probably more appropriate for sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| The other major change was removing Chapter 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| which focuses on conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| between the one-year plan land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| and the zoning maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| the presumption being that there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| some grand governmental rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| to bring all these conflicts into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| There are over 1,600 of these conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| and this stems not from an error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| but from the differing premises of zoning and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| Zoning is generally more reflective of historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| and ongoing uses of a specific property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| whereas the land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| reflects the future vision of that land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| for that property or region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| Any rezoning brought forth by a property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| must comply with the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| so if a conflicting property on this map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| was submitted for a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| that conflict would disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| This process is already described in Chapter 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| Planning is not proposing any broad governmental rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| to resolve all these conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Doing so could result in legal uses of a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| suddenly being made illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| Since we're not proposing that anything be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| about these conflicts, we are recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| removing this chapter to reduce confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| about what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| We conducted two public input meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| at the end of January and beginning of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| and there were no community comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| made on the proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4693)|

| 1:18:31| some of those conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| were due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| after recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| was initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4721)|

| 1:18:47| Same thing with RN5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| It listed a lot of those, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| That is a common conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| And it was proposed in 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| that RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| be included in LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4741)|

| 1:19:05| That was recommended by Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| at the time but was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| denied by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4749)|

| 1:19:15| Jessie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| by removing that LDR classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4759)|

| 1:19:23| would that allow them to go in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| kind of clear-cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| a slope that's higher than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| that if it was LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| No, this is more reflecting how the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| use is actually applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| There are many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| sloped areas that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4777)|

| 1:22:38| and then my deputy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| Brian Berry, will give you a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4960)|

| 1:22:50| impact the balance of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| With the removal of a functional family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| in the zoning code during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| the recode process, we now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| have a group that likes to try and build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| 24 bedroom duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| predominantly in the Fort Sanders area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| for students, but we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| them spread out beyond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| We feel that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| inappropriate to provide four parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| for 24 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| are working on a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| term solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| with our law department. I'd like to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| with planning to go through some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| of the possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| but really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| the impact is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| those that are trying to game the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| and build massive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| single family dwellings or duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| with lots of bedrooms that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| intended for large families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| Again, Brian will give you a lot more context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| When we do see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| large homes built outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| of the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| housing area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| they're predominantly on larger lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| where there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| plenty of parking, so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| impact is not adding more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| impervious area on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| large family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| It's just intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| to provide adequate parking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| the rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| space. I hesitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| distinguishing rental versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| property ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| because we have folks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| tell us what we want to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| in the permitting stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| and the realities are sometimes different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Now Brian will give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| more context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| and then I'll be happy to answer any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| Hello, Brian Berry with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| provide a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| of context here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| I'm sure you guys are looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| and have initial thoughts and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| about why we're increasing parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| hopefully this will give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| context to it and help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| you understand the impact that it will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| based on what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| proposing. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| bigger, broader picture across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| and this is based on census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| data of 2022, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| 94,129| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| so that's across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| In those housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| five or more bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| make up about two percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| so there's not a lot of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| units with five or more bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| across the city. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| 1,817 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| it's impacting a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| segment of residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| development that takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| within the city. So what does it mean though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| for single family and duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| Well the proposal that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| only adds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| .65 per additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| bedroom above four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| bedrooms so the fifth bedroom and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| beyond would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| .65 additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| parking spaces per bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| so for a single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| home, let's put that into context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| if a single family home has six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| bedrooms and right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| now they are currently required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| provide two parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| so based on the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| what they would be required to provide is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| three parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| if you increase that to an eight bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| single family home that was being built today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| currently they are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| two spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| and the proposed amendment would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| require five spaces but again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| we're talking about eight bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| for a single family home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| that's two percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| less than two percent probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| of the housing units within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| are being built with eight bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| so let's look at duplex too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| the minimum parking requirement for a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| is two per dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| so a total of four for two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| what this proposal would increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| that to if you had six bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| it would increase that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| to from four spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| to six spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| so three each unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| so if you increase that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| you had a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| that was doing eight beds on each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| side for a total of 16 bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| the current requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| would only be four spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| based on what we're proposing it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| ten spaces so five each unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| and it goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| with townhomes and we could elaborate there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| but again housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| totaling five or more bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| are a small fraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| of residential development within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| and what the focus is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| here is on developments as Peter had said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| that are looking to maximize bedroom counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| in order to rent by the bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| and so these are the ones that we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| where people are proposing and building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| single family homes with eight nine bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| or duplexes with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| you know eight or nine bedrooms on each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| side for a total of 18 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| I've got a quick question for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| so you guys are looking at duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| you know it's two units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| but you're still considering it one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| one house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| you had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| you have a two bedroom duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| and a two bedroom duplex you got four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| then you have three and three you have six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| and then you were increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| yeah it's per side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| so you have a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| and each side of the duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| is proposing eight bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| so that would be for a total of 16 bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| right I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| where I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| the trigger is between two and three bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| duplex and then four bedrooms on a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| family detached or is it all on four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| it's more than four so as soon as you hit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| fifth bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| is when the .65 comes in to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| per dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| unit right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| I thought I heard you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| there's a two bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| duplex two and two is four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| I may have I should have said a two unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| because then it was like two better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| two parking places for one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| of the duplex and two on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| of the duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| then when it went to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| bedrooms on each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| side for a total of six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| it required one extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| for a total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| six parking places that's what I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| I may have misheard you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| so it's still triggered on four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| bedrooms either way correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| doesn't matter if it's a duplex or a single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| or just unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| four bedrooms okay thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5385)|

| 1:29:59| this a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| widespread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| problem is it confined to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5403)|

| 1:30:09| applying it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| maybe more broadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| it largely applies to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| in and around the Fort Sanders area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| it's student housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| but if this will affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| all of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| sure we are seeing it go outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| of the fort was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| there any consideration of looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| at confining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5430)|

| 1:35:12| is or what I'm trying to draw is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| if our middle housing code within TDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5714)|

| 1:37:24| I would drive in on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| weekdays and park in the Fort as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| a non-resident so I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| could be one solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| to potentially help ease parking concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5852)|

| 1:37:40| that's an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| I think if you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5862)|

| 1:37:58| but they can do it so they maximize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| the scale they maximize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5880)|

| 1:38:06| that's where I see that as different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| than the middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5888)|

| 1:38:26| my understanding of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| not that the pressures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5908)|

| 1:38:36| feeling pressures from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| and a lot more activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| in the area taking parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5922)|

| 1:38:50| so just want to draw that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| but the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| I still haven't heard like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| where the complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| has come from like what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| actually you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| and Mr. Berry noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| that you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| more of these types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| developments happen and so it seems like maybe you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| trying to get in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| of more of them happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| but where did the complaint come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| Recently you saw where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5958)|

| 1:39:26| lack of parking in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Most of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| are students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| so they're not going to complain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5974)|

| 1:39:44| that's why we're bringing this before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| landlords don't care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5988)|

| 1:39:58| I'm not sure that they care as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| a homeowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6000)|

| 1:40:10| an increase in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6010)|

| 1:40:20| we've seen when I got here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| there was a parking issue in the fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| we've seen it get worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| this is just an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| to try and slow that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| So are you guys trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| add more parking or limit the size of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| building through this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| We're trying to make sure that the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| is more in alignment with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| the number of bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| I would say you can think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| I'm sorry this is Mike down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| people are building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6050)|

| 1:40:54| because they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| more units on a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| with less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| versus creating an actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| unit for each person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| so it's definitely a work around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| to try to get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| on less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| What extent have you talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| with the university because it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| that the student body has a real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| with finding housing to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| and so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| this is I'm assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| a two part issue with parking and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| bedrooms I'm not really getting a lot of clarification on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| what issue we're addressing with this but in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| mind it seems like we're trying to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| the bedroom issue because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| realistically where the hell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| are you going to put 10 parking spots in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6094)|

| 1:41:40| my first question is have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| addressed the housing crisis with the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| and my second question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| is where do you foresee these parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| spots going or is that just the justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| to get to the bedroom issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| To answer your first question I've not reached out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6114)|

| 1:41:58| If your point is to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| the student housing issue in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6120)|

| 1:42:08| I don't have a good answer for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| question where will they put them the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6132)|

| 1:42:20| bedrooms so the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| to everybody's question is that you're trying to reduce the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| of bedrooms it has nothing to do with parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| it's both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| it's making sure that there's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| parking for the number of bedrooms so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| they'll put more parking on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| you know they'll maximize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| off of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| you're saying there's no space to put the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| because there's not so then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| my third question is with the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| and the cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| they've stated multiple times I mean they had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| whole Cumberland project to make it more pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| friendly which by the way I'm totally in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| of so why are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| now concerned about students being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| drive around when our whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| motive as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| and as a community is to make this all more connective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| and walkable and create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| more sidewalks and now all of a sudden we have a parking crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| and I'm sorry I know I'm coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| at you and I know this is probably not all your fault but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| you got chosen to stand here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| what have you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| I think again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| trying to provide so parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| for multifamily dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| for apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| they are either required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| by the number of bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| or they can be required if you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| renting by the bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| so it's .67 per bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| for a multifamily apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| if a developer says I'm renting by the bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| that's how we would calculate it so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| we took that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| and tried to apply it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| again we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| 18 bedroom duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| 9 bedrooms on each side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| realistically we know that that's what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| they're renting by the bedroom and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| the similar with what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| being applied to apartments that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| saying they're renting by the bedroom is what we're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| here as well that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| you are renting by the bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| once you hit that threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| of 5 bedrooms or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| that's what's applied for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| bedroom moving forward so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| we're not trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| squelch development we're just trying to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| that adequate parking is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| provided for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| duplex if they're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| 18 bedrooms and they're renting by the bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| but the code only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| requires them 4 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| so hopefully that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| for any of the new developments on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| the strip on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| do we, we probably don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| or haven't talked to those owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| of those bigger buildings with big parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| like how utilized are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| those big parking lots that they're having to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| I mean I know they offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| them to their tenants and what but it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| interesting to see data on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| because in my mind it's sort of making me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| think that if these are being built in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| fort with not much parking and people are renting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| them I presume you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| maybe we require too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| parking for both this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| other types of multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| some data would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| this is not data it's anecdotal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| but I was speaking to a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| from New Jersey who has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6312)|

| 1:45:18| on Cumberland Avenue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6320)|

| 1:45:26| individuals so it sounded like it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| 5 bedroom apartment and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| they had 2 parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| spaces allotted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| that unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| so it does sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| anecdotally it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| like for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| they had 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6342)|

| 1:46:08| you've got a large university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| that renting by the bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| that is a very common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| non-university run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6374)|

| 1:46:22| don't have parking at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| just speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6386)|

| 1:53:46| the hospital parking is one thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| has always kind of surprised me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| because there's a ton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| of parking associated with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6832)|

| 1:54:26| with a lot of what other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| have said and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| curious if you guys have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| thought about this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| approach rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| requiring more on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6878)|

| 1:54:42| and again you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| being a big limiting factor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| number of units that are able to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| is there any consideration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| getting the city to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6894)|

| 1:54:58| and UT to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| the table to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6900)|

| 1:55:10| trying to maximize dollars on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6910)|

| 1:55:14| potatoes compared to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| hospital and UT so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| have you all made any efforts on that approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| I'm sure the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6922)|

| 1:55:26| conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| but I would imagine those were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| part of the conversations with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6930)|

| 1:55:38| last question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| one that's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6940)|

| 1:56:06| but then if there's no one you know if the people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240305-agenda-review?start=6966)|
