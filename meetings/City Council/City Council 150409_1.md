| 2:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| So the C.1. zone has the same, in the proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10495)|
| 2:54:59| the C.1. zone would have the same height limit as all the other commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10499)|
| 2:55:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| I'm talking about a county zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| But I will tell you that zoning, if you don't go look at exactly what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10510)|
| 2:55:18| you will be doing something you don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10518)|
| 2:55:22| Zoning has a sign height situation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| And if you start working with that and start driving that and start testing all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10525)|
| 2:55:34| you're going to regret what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| It won't fit what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10536)|
| 2:55:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| I was just going to follow up and ask either Mr. Marshall Stare or the gentleman or George,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10543)|
| 2:55:50| is it better to take out zones that don't fit like C.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10550)|
| 2:55:54| Or you're saying it's better to go simply to a road gradation type to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10554)|
| 2:56:00| That's really what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| And Mr. Parnell, I guess, wants to give us a piece of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10562)|
| 2:56:07| I'm calling on Mr. Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| I just want to understand what's the best way to tackle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| And does anyone have a rationale that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| assuming we don't just modify which zones or which, which is the best way to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| Well, I think historically what we have in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10580)|
| 2:56:24| and I think in most communities is a link between the sign regulations and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10584)|
| 2:56:32| And I think the difficulty that may be encountered if you were to now change to an approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10592)|
| 2:56:40| that was based on the street classification, which is, that's the functional classification of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10600)|
| 2:56:47| It's how much traffic it can carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| It is related to speed, but it's more related to the volume of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10610)|
| 2:56:55| that can safely be carried at a level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| So the difficulty is, and the example that Councilman Wallace gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10618)|
| 2:57:05| is where there are some communities, some small, what are effectively residential streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10625)|
| 2:57:12| where zoning has been changed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| There may be some office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10634)|
| 2:57:15| There may be some commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10635)|
| 2:57:17| So those went in under the provisions related to signs linked to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10637)|
| 2:57:24| And if there were a change to the functional classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10644)|
| 2:57:28| and there were a difference in the sign regulations, whether it's height or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10648)|
| 2:57:35| you are almost certainly going to have adjacent properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10655)|
| 2:57:40| at least properties that are similarly situated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| and that's the standard term in land use regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| When you have properties that are similarly situated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| generally they're going to be treated the same way if they're in the same zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10670)|
| 2:57:55| And often they are in the same zoning district in order to be treated the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10675)|
| 2:58:01| So you will have adjacent properties that may be zoned the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10681)|
| 2:58:06| but have different sign regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| You may even have, and I predict that you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| the same business, this is selling tires, that one is selling tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10691)|
| 2:58:16| they're in the same business, they're competing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10696)|
| 2:58:19| but they have different sign regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| So I think that is a potential, and I would argue a probability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10701)|
| 2:58:26| if you change to a street classification approach as opposed to a zoning approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10706)|
| 2:58:33| Councilman Wallace, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10713)|
| 2:58:37| Well, I think, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| You know, the examples I would look at, and there probably are some holes in that, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10721)|
| 2:58:48| And you may have to go back and tweak part of Cedar Lane from the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| it's not that specific, from the railroad tracks to, you know, to the interstate or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10732)|
| 2:58:58| But again, it does define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10738)|
| 2:59:01| It goes through a commercial zone and it goes back into residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| You're trying to protect those creeping of commercial into residential areas, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10744)|
| 2:59:09| And number two, it's all mixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| On Paper Mill and Wise Garber, you've got R2, O1, and C4, C6, all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10751)|
| 2:59:22| And it's on the same road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| And there are times when, you know, you're going to have different size signs on different properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10764)|
| 2:59:29| There's no way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| But it's mixing it up, and when it cuts through neighborhoods, it affects it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10772)|
| 2:59:39| And I just think there's way too many areas where a 30-foot sign is too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10779)|
| 2:59:44| When you have an industrial park, they're all the same and it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| You can do it by the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| But in Knoxville, it's all mixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| And these roads, you're trying to protect your neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| and trying to lower your heights down to really to the road traffic and to a more aesthetic look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10794)|
| 3:00:03| Councilman Walz, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| I mean, are you saying purely based on road classification and throw the zoning out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| Because it seems to me what we have even presented before us is a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10811)|
| 3:00:15| It's broken down by zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| But in the commercial zone, which is the real crux of the whole thing, 11.6, all the commercial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10818)|
| 3:00:28| we've got two numbers, a 30 and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| So it's already been broken down once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| It's 40 feet based if you're on the interstate or an interstate interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10835)|
| 3:00:40| So that to me is based on road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| And 30 feet for everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| It's pretty simple, but it's based on road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10846)|
| 3:00:49| But it's still within the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| Are you saying to do away basically with all of Section 11, which is broken down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10851)|
| 3:00:58| Section 11.5 is office zones, 11.4 is residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10858)|
| 3:01:03| Are you saying do away with all of those and just have it be based on road classifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10863)|
| 3:01:08| Are you saying just within 11.6, just within the commercial zones, have it broken down to have it be based on road classifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10868)|
| 3:01:19| To me that makes sense because it's already broken down into road classifications for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10879)|
| 3:01:26| And then two, residential areas don't need signs, don't want signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10886)|
| 3:01:31| You know, the whole enchilada is involved in the commercial signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10891)|
| 3:01:37| Is that what you're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| That's what I'm proposing, that it's by road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10899)|
| 3:01:43| It's within 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| But still within 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| Are you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| Not in residential or one of the other categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| He's talking about commercial and industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| 11.5 is office, so that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| So you're talking about all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| Because R1, the residential zones, don't have signage in the loud server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10921)|
| 3:02:07| But that's because, see that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| That's a regulation based on zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| So are you saying that's, so residential would be treated the same as commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| I'm talking about 11.5 and 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| 11.5 is office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| Right, and those are currently treated differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| There's a lot less signage for office zones versus commercial zones in the current proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10945)|
| 3:02:32| But you're saying if they're on the same street, they should have the same sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10955)|
| 3:02:36| If they're on the same street, they should have the same zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| If you have office on Kingston Pike and then the one on Magnolia, they were zoned office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| They went to, I think, C3 to get the taller, even though they're still on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10963)|
| 3:02:47| They didn't move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| Their use changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10969)|
| 3:02:50| That was a dialysis clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| His only reason was he wanted a taller sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| That's what he got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10975)|
| 3:02:56| The same with Wallace Memorial Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10976)|
| 3:02:59| They're on Merchants Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10979)|
| 3:03:01| So it's based on the road classification, not based on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10981)|
| 3:03:05| Can I jump into this for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10987)|
| 3:03:08| I guess my question is, I see functional differences between an office district, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10988)|
| 3:03:18| Mostly you're going to the doctor, the lawyer, the accountant, whatever, to get a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10998)|
| 3:03:24| And you're not hauling people off the street as they drive by and you say, well, let's have an impulse visit with the accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11004)|
| 3:03:31| I mean, that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11011)|
| 3:03:32| So really, you know, the street number and a little monument sign or something on the wall says Dr. Smith or, you know, whatever, gets you into an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11012)|
| 3:03:42| Because you're really going almost for an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11022)|
| 3:03:45| I don't think there should be, in 11.5, there's a pole sign under 2i.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11025)|
| 3:03:50| I don't get why we have that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| I think simple signage in an office area makes sense because you're just helping the traveler going to a destination to say, oh, it's that one, or the next building, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11032)|
| 3:04:05| Whereas I can see in commercial, if you're selling hamburgers at McDonald's, you're trying to, you know, wave your banner in the sky and get them to decide, yeah, I'm hungry, I'll pull in and eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11045)|
| 3:04:15| And then no one's really got a lot of forethought in the visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11055)|
| 3:04:18| Now, that's not 100% true, but that's part of the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11058)|
| 3:04:22| So I can see where you would treat office different than commercial and maybe even neighborhood commercial because it's more semi-residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11062)|
| 3:04:31| I mean, like when I look at 11.5, I would take out the pole sign in that office thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11071)|
| 3:04:36| I think we're adding pole signs where they never were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11076)|
| 3:04:40| But now when you get to your section, the question is how clear are the road classifications related to the physical activity of, you know, commerce or industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11080)|
| 3:04:51| And that's kind of where I see the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| There's a second debate, and I guess that's the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| I mean, is 40 the right number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| Is 30 the right number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11100)|
| 3:05:01| Does anyone have any issue with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| But you're saying here's how to measure it by street classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| I guess I don't know how true that works out with whether it's commercial, residential, office, or some other flavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11107)|
| 3:05:16| I don't know if Dan Kelly can enlighten us about the correlation between the kind of common use districts like in a commercial zone versus the road classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11116)|
| 3:05:27| which I think Mr. Parnell said was more about the capacity of the road to handle a certain number of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11127)|
| 3:05:33| Can you help us at all figure out what classification makes sense from a planning standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11133)|
| 3:05:41| Well, I think what you would find is that most of the C3, C4 type zoning would more than likely be located typically along arterial streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11141)|
| 3:05:54| or certainly major collectors are arterial streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11154)|
| 3:06:00| We're certainly not in the ñ when you have neighborhood commercial development back in, say, down in Sequoia Hills and places like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11160)|
| 3:06:14| that's a C1 zoning district down in there, and I don't think that we would entertain a C3 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11174)|
| 3:06:24| or wouldn't recommend approval of a C3 zoning in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11184)|
| 3:06:28| There are certain areas that are inherently neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11188)|
| 3:06:34| and there are other areas that are typically in what we see as the strip commercial development along the major arterial streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11194)|
| 3:06:43| Zoning is controlled by the long-range land use plan and the one-year plan and the long-range land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11203)|
| 3:06:51| So if the church came in and applied for commercial zoning, it was compliant and recommended for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11211)|
| 3:07:04| It was because it complied with the long-range land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11224)|
| 3:07:08| and therefore once it got zone commercial they had the right then to put up the sign that's permitted in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11228)|
| 3:07:18| I don't know if I can ñ I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11238)|
| 3:07:21| Well, the question is in terms of overall planning, where should we be leaning the sign regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11241)|
| 3:07:27| Should it be on the speed or capacity of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11247)|
| 3:07:31| or should it be the zone and the use that someone's decided is relatively compatible with surrounding uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11251)|
| 3:07:37| And I'm trying to get ñ we've got to pick that, and then we've got to fight about what's tall or too tall or too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11257)|
| 3:07:43| I think that's the argument here tonight, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| The current zoning ordinance has it based on the zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| and the zoning districts that are most prevalent along the arterial streets are the ones that permit the high signs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11269)|
| 3:07:59| So to a certain degree there is a self-selection going on there already along by the classification of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11279)|
| 3:08:10| although not being done on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11290)|
| 3:08:14| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11294)|
| 3:08:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| I feel like this is deja vu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11297)|
| 3:08:19| On July 23, 2014, a motion was made to do ñ George made the motion to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11299)|
| 3:08:28| It ended up ñ that ended up in a tie vote at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11308)|
| 3:08:33| On August 21, 2013, it came up again in terms of looking at the sign heights and how we classify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11313)|
| 3:08:42| We went through several motions, and finally on motion number three, it was voted on with what's been presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11322)|
| 3:08:49| And that vote was a 6-2 vote at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11329)|
| 3:08:53| So I want council to understand and know, and the folks, that this wasn't something that was just taken lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11333)|
| 3:09:01| In other words, we had several meetings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11341)|
| 3:09:04| We discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11344)|
| 3:09:06| We went through all the ifs, you might say, and finally did come up with a vote on what to recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11346)|
| 3:09:13| But it was looked at in terms of the different streets and this sort of thing because, if you remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11353)|
| 3:09:18| it really started out in the very beginning that way back in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11358)|
| 3:09:22| But the sign task force, as I said, we did vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| It was a 6-2 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11367)|
| 3:09:28| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11368)|
| 3:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11369)|
| 3:09:30| When we began this evening several days ago, we talked about the fact that this was designed to simplify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11370)|
| 3:09:39| bring all the sign regulations into one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11379)|
| 3:09:43| Well, if we're going through this and we have, you know, 11A, B, C, and D dealing with zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11383)|
| 3:09:51| and then we get to 11E, and now we're looking at a different way of determining the sign height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11391)|
| 3:09:57| I don't see that that is simplifying or accomplishing the goal of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11397)|
| 3:10:01| or the intent originally of council when we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11401)|
| 3:10:05| And while I commend Mr. Wallace's ideas on this particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11405)|
| 3:10:09| I don't think that it's the thing that we need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11409)|
| 3:10:13| I think we need to stick with zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11413)|
| 3:10:16| That's what people expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| That's what they've dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| And if we need to look at the zones themselves or the whole zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11419)|
| 3:10:24| I feel sure that down the road that's something that we'll all be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11424)|
| 3:10:28| But right now I think we need to stick with zoning as opposed to other ways of determining sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11428)|
| 3:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11438)|
| 3:10:39| Ms. Feld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11441)|
| 3:10:42| I just wanted to reiterate what Melissa McAdams said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11442)|
| 3:10:47| which is that, first of all, the task force was not balanced, and that's reflected in the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11447)|
| 3:10:53| This was, as you might guess, the most divisive topic in the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11453)|
| 3:11:01| and there really was no clear agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11461)|
| 3:11:04| I can certainly show you tables that everybody filled out prior to that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| and you'll find a very wide variation and very different results than what got collapsed into here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11469)|
| 3:11:16| And I want to say that we support sign height by road classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11476)|
| 3:11:21| whether it's four categories or five categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11481)|
| 3:11:25| We embrace that idea and we support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11485)|
| 3:11:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11489)|
| 3:11:30| Councilman Grieve, did you have more or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11492)|
| 3:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11493)|
| 3:11:34| Right now we have a motion and a second to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| It would be sections 11.5 and 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11497)|
| 3:11:42| How would we say this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11502)|
| 3:11:43| That height would be determined by road classification per the MPC roadmap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| That's the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| And if it passed, then you'd have to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11509)|
| 3:11:52| Okay, so that's the motion and second that's on the table right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11512)|
| 3:11:55| Let's do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11515)|
| 3:11:56| We'll do a roll call vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11518)|
| 3:12:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11520)|
| 3:12:01| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11521)|
| 3:12:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11522)|
| 3:12:03| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11523)|
| 3:12:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11524)|
| 3:12:05| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11525)|
| 3:12:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11526)|
| 3:12:07| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11527)|
| 3:12:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11528)|
| 3:12:09| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11529)|
| 3:12:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11530)|
| 3:12:12| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11532)|
| 3:12:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11533)|
| 3:12:14| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| No, not if we're going to join office and commercial together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11536)|
| 3:12:19| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| I agree with Mr. Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11541)|
| 3:12:25| It does pass five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11545)|
| 3:12:32| Now what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11552)|
| 3:12:33| Okay, now, so are you going to recommend heights per road classification now or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11553)|
| 3:12:43| I'm going to recommend that you divide it in five classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11563)|
| 3:12:49| Which are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| Which are what we just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11571)|
| 3:12:56| Five hundred feet of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| Five hundred feet of the interstate adjacent to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11578)|
| 3:13:03| Major arterial roads, major and minor arterial roads, major and minor collector roads, and all roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11583)|
| 3:13:12| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11592)|
| 3:13:13| That would be five hundred feet of the interstate adjacent to the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11593)|
| 3:13:20| major and minor arterial roads, major and minor collector roads, all roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11600)|
| 3:13:27| I mean, all other roads, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11607)|
| 3:13:33| Okay, and then you're doing heights for each of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11613)|
| 3:13:39| Yeah, we can do heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| Isn't that what you have to do at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| Well, I think you've got to agree to those classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11624)|
| 3:13:46| I mean, that can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11626)|
| 3:13:47| I mean, you don't have to have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11627)|
| 3:13:48| That's my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11628)|
| 3:13:49| All right, so that is their second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11629)|
| 3:14:04| Okay, those of you who voted for this, what are you thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| You've really opened a can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11647)|
| 3:14:10| That's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11650)|
| 3:14:11| I didn't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11651)|
| 3:14:12| What's your alternative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11652)|
| 3:14:14| You know, go back to what the assigned task force recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| Forty-thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11656)|
| 3:14:20| I don't think he was talking height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11660)|
| 3:14:21| I think he was talking zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| Yeah, I think the zones ought to stay the way they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11663)|
| 3:14:26| Everyone's all over the map on height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11666)|
| 3:14:27| And then we ought to look at each one of those zones and look at the chart that shows the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11667)|
| 3:14:33| Because right now in the office, right now in the office, we don't allow a ground or pole sign higher than ten feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11673)|
| 3:14:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11678)|
| 3:14:39| And now you've thrown that in with this category with commercial and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11679)|
| 3:14:43| You've got an office on a highway and you've got a 60-foot or three-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| I mean, to me, it's like Ms. Palmer said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11687)|
| 3:14:50| What we were trying to do is keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| Now, that may not satisfy everybody's needs and desires, but at least we were keeping it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11693)|
| 3:14:58| We already have zoning throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11698)|
| 3:15:00| We know that that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11700)|
| 3:15:01| And so what we were trying to do is to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11701)|
| 3:15:05| And as I said, the vote from the signed task force was 6-2 in terms of that after several meetings of discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11705)|
| 3:15:15| So I just think that if you start looking at the road classifications, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11715)|
| 3:15:20| what's to say that somebody decides that they get a petition together and decide that they want to make their road more than what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11720)|
| 3:15:26| You know, have more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| Be up to NPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11728)|
| 3:15:29| You know, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11729)|
| 3:15:30| But I'm just saying we're complicating the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11730)|
| 3:15:33| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| Councilman Walz, what do you think about a motion to make the road classifications just apply to 11.6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11734)|
| 3:15:42| So you'd leave the zoning structure in place, but with the commercial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11742)|
| 3:15:48| and that's the only location where there's 30- and 40-foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11748)|
| 3:15:52| It's not in the office currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| We do it by road classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11754)|
| 3:16:01| That way you're leaving the basic structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| And as I said earlier, 11.6, it already does it by road classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11763)|
| 3:16:07| If you're next to an interstate, you get 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11767)|
| 3:16:10| That's a road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11770)|
| 3:16:11| It's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| So we can leave 11.5 as is or make amendments to it separately but not try to combine them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11773)|
| 3:16:22| which is going to muck up the whole ordinance somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11782)|
| 3:16:27| and just apply the road classifications for the zones addressed in 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11787)|
| 3:16:36| I think you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11796)|
| 3:16:37| I think the purpose is that you have roads that are mixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11797)|
| 3:16:42| I mean, when you have a major arterial road, Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11802)|
| 3:16:46| If you have a residential property on that, you couldn't put up a sign, a big sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11806)|
| 3:16:51| It's granted that there's particular use in those sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11811)|
| 3:16:54| and there are large sections that are all zone C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11814)|
| 3:16:57| That works out really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| That's not where the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11819)|
| 3:17:00| The problem is when you deviate off of major arterial roads down to Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11820)|
| 3:17:06| You go through Dean Hill, you have parts of Dean Hill that are industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11826)|
| 3:17:10| that are office, that are back to residential, and C3 and C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11830)|
| 3:17:18| It's all mixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11838)|
| 3:17:19| I mean, it's not consistent when you get off your major arterial roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| That's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11843)|
| 3:17:25| I mean, Dan Kelly brought up down on Kennesaw on Keeley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| The filling station down there is zone C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11850)|
| 3:17:35| I mean, it seems inappropriate to say you can have a C1 and have a 30-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11855)|
| 3:17:39| And that's why, I mean, I never have liked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11859)|
| 3:17:43| That's why I'm proposing, since there's five votes to do it by road classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11863)|
| 3:17:47| just to limit that to the commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11870)|
| 3:17:51| I mean, I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11871)|
| 3:17:52| But, I mean, that's the rationale behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| is that when you're on a major road and the large sections are all zoned the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| and their use is the same, it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| But where it doesn't, that's what you're trying to protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11881)|
| 3:18:04| and you're trying to get it down on lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11884)|
| 3:18:08| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11888)|
| 3:18:10| Unless you're in a commercial zone, you're not going to be able to put up a real big sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11890)|
| 3:18:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11893)|
| 3:18:14| And we're still going to do it by road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11894)|
| 3:18:16| So if we lower those for the commercial zones, you're still going to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11896)|
| 3:18:20| I don't know what your goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11900)|
| 3:18:22| I think it can still, you can still get, reduce the sign clutter and address the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11902)|
| 3:18:29| But if you try to combine 11.5 and 11.6, then you potentially add clutter in office where it's not currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11909)|
| 3:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11920)|
| 3:18:41| I mean, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11921)|
| 3:18:42| So I'd make a motion to, I guess a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11922)|
| 3:18:50| Amend the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11930)|
| 3:18:51| Amend the amendment to propose road classifications, but only in 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11931)|
| 3:19:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11941)|
| 3:19:02| Just legally, how do we need to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11942)|
| 3:19:05| I was thinking about a motion to reconsider because what's been voted on in past applies to sections 11.5 and 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11945)|
| 3:19:16| What you might want to do is have a motion to reconsider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| and that has to be made and seconded by someone that was on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11958)|
| 3:19:24| And then if it's reconsidered, then as Councilman Starr can put his proposed motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11964)|
| 3:19:33| So you can make that motion, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11973)|
| 3:19:34| Yeah, we'll make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11974)|
| 3:19:37| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11977)|
| 3:19:38| Okay, it's a motion to reconsider the previous, which was 11.5 and 11.6 road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11978)|
| 3:19:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11988)|
| 3:19:49| And what are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11989)|
| 3:19:52| 11.5 is 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11992)|
| 3:19:53| But what are those road classifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| Well, that's not a part of it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11995)|
| 3:19:56| It was just the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| We're going to make a motion to break out the commercial from the office right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=11998)|
| 3:20:03| The purpose of here, the purpose of this is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| Oh, Charles is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| We're not filling him in from the beginning, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| He'll catch up with us soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12012)|
| 3:20:13| Go back to section 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12013)|
| 3:20:15| I think you don't want to walk in yet, is all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12015)|
| 3:20:18| Okay, the purpose here is to remove the office, 11.5, from this motion that passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12018)|
| 3:20:27| which was to have 11.5 and 11.6 be the heights be considered based on road classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12027)|
| 3:20:36| per the road map rather than zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12036)|
| 3:20:39| Actually, Mayor, you have two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12039)|
| 3:20:42| One is the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12044)|
| 3:20:45| And assuming that passes, the second vote is what Councilman Stair proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12045)|
| 3:20:48| Which would be just to have 11.6 in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| So the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12050)|
| 3:20:51| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12051)|
| 3:20:54| Everyone understand what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12054)|
| 3:20:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12056)|
| 3:20:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12057)|
| 3:20:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12058)|
| 3:20:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12059)|
| 3:21:00| Okay, so that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| Motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12062)|
| 3:21:03| Now, Councilman Stair, what's your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12063)|
| 3:21:06| A motion to break it down to road classifications, but just in 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12066)|
| 3:21:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12074)|
| 3:21:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12075)|
| 3:21:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12076)|
| 3:21:17| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12077)|
| 3:21:22| Okay, we're going to do a roll call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12082)|
| 3:21:25| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12085)|
| 3:21:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12087)|
| 3:21:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12089)|
| 3:21:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12090)|
| 3:21:31| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12091)|
| 3:21:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12092)|
| 3:21:33| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12093)|
| 3:21:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12094)|
| 3:21:35| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12095)|
| 3:21:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12096)|
| 3:21:37| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12097)|
| 3:21:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12099)|
| 3:21:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12100)|
| 3:21:41| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12101)|
| 3:21:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12102)|
| 3:21:43| Okay, so that passes six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12103)|
| 3:21:48| Now what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12108)|
| 3:21:50| Councilman Wallace, what do you think about the four that we originally started with back in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12110)|
| 3:21:56| property within interstate interchange areas, property adjacent to the interstate right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12116)|
| 3:22:02| property fronting federal highways, and all other eligible property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12122)|
| 3:22:08| Well, the only thing I don't like about that is that that's not the terminology that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12128)|
| 3:22:12| she's in that road plan, and they use the word collector and arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12132)|
| 3:22:16| That's the only problem I have with that, and they don't use the same, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12136)|
| 3:22:20| I would think you'd want to use the same terminology all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12140)|
| 3:22:23| So when you refer to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12143)|
| 3:22:25| Are federal highways always arterial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| I guess they must be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| Yeah, I don't know that, so let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12149)|
| 3:22:36| Vice Mayor, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12156)|
| 3:22:39| Hanson Pike is a major arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| Mayor, can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12162)|
| 3:22:46| I think all of us right now are getting ourselves really, really deeply in the weeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12166)|
| 3:22:51| because just like George, we had discussions on what arterial was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12171)|
| 3:22:56| In other words, we need someone to be able to tell us exactly what these designations are for these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12176)|
| 3:23:02| You know, for instance, where we have a category that says all other roads, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12182)|
| 3:23:06| I want to know what those roads are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12186)|
| 3:23:08| I want to see them on a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12188)|
| 3:23:10| I want to know that if I vote for this, regardless of the sign height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12190)|
| 3:23:14| that if I'm voting and it says an arterial road, I want to know where that arterial road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12194)|
| 3:23:19| I want to know if we're talking 500 feet from the center line of the interstate around that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12199)|
| 3:23:25| I want to see that interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| I want to see a line drawn around and have a clear understanding of what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12207)|
| 3:23:32| in terms of having a sign at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12212)|
| 3:23:35| I think for us to sit here, especially after the sign task force went through this over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12215)|
| 3:23:41| that if you folks don't understand what these different roads are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12221)|
| 3:23:45| that we're really voting on something that we're not really well qualified to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12225)|
| 3:23:50| And so I think that somewhere along the line, if we're going to go this route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12230)|
| 3:23:54| that we need to be able to see and know for sure so that we can tell not only the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12234)|
| 3:24:00| but tell the business community that we made a sensible, well-defined decision based on information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12240)|
| 3:24:07| instead of us sitting here saying, well, you know, I think Kingston Pike's an arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12247)|
| 3:24:11| Well, I think, well, actually, that's a Tennessee state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12251)|
| 3:24:14| Well, no, it's a parkway, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12254)|
| 3:24:16| Because we went through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12256)|
| 3:24:18| And I think that before you make those decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12258)|
| 3:24:21| that we need to know exactly what you're talking about and exactly what those roads are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12261)|
| 3:24:27| And I think we have someone at the front that would like to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12267)|
| 3:24:30| Well, I would just like to add, and those classifications do change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12270)|
| 3:24:34| They do change, and they change often based on a number of factors, and they can go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12274)|
| 3:24:40| And I would point out Smith Road and Farragut as a prime example where it went the other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12280)|
| 3:24:45| which is not typical, but that would have been a mess if we'd have done this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12285)|
| 3:24:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12289)|
| 3:24:52| Well, if I can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| Ms. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12294)|
| 3:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12295)|
| 3:24:56| And there's such a big difference between, and I'm in favor of sign control, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12296)|
| 3:25:01| But this is really a bit concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12301)|
| 3:25:06| There is such a big difference between major and minor collectors, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12306)|
| 3:25:11| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12311)|
| 3:25:13| And it is, as Don Parnell said, it's based on function, based on what happens with additional roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12313)|
| 3:25:24| As the man just said, the classification can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12324)|
| 3:25:29| I think zoning, and I understand what Councilman Wallace is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12329)|
| 3:25:34| Sometimes, you know, you're allowed this here and you're allowed this there, and the zoning changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12334)|
| 3:25:41| But it changes, and so the sign allowed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12341)|
| 3:25:44| But as Mr. Kelly pointed out, if you're on a major arterial, chances are you're commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12344)|
| 3:25:53| And if you're commercial, you're allowed certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12353)|
| 3:25:56| If you're zoned office and you're sitting on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12356)|
| 3:26:01| I would guess that if you want to go commercial, you're going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12361)|
| 3:26:07| And if you do that because you want a bigger sign or a higher sign or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12367)|
| 3:26:11| or if you do that because you want a wider range of uses, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12371)|
| 3:26:17| It's whether or not the zone is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| I think the sign right now makes more sense to go with the zoning than it does to complicate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12379)|
| 3:26:25| and smoosh together major and minor arterials, major and minor collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12385)|
| 3:26:30| Major and minor stuff are big, big differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12390)|
| 3:26:35| We know not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12395)|
| 3:26:37| And I don't ordinarily agree with these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12397)|
| 3:26:42| Thank you, Carlene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12402)|
| 3:26:43| That was noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| Yeah, please note that, Carlene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12405)|
| 3:26:46| That's noted, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12406)|
| 3:26:48| Endorsing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12408)|
| 3:26:49| Well, the four road classifications that this council approved and voted six to three on in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12409)|
| 3:27:03| they defined what was a federally designated highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12423)|
| 3:27:06| It's Chapman Highway, Henley, Broadway, Kingston Pike, Asheville Highway, Rutledge Pike, Clinton Highway, and Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12426)|
| 3:27:15| And the property within interstate interchanges and adjacent to the interstate right-of-way is already in the current proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12435)|
| 3:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12445)|
| 3:27:26| So I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12446)|
| 3:27:30| You know, this is really the biggest issue, you know, and we might as well start talking about heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12450)|
| 3:27:38| When council, how we got into this, Joe Bailey introduced an ordinance, and it was on those four classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12458)|
| 3:27:46| interstate interchanges 50 feet, interstate right-of-way 35 feet, all other federal highways 20 feet, and all other eligible properties 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12466)|
| 3:27:56| At that time, 2011, Councilman Grieve made a motion, which was pass 6-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12476)|
| 3:28:03| and the ordinance was passed on first reading 6-3 with the heights of 25, 20, 15, and 10 for those road classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12483)|
| 3:28:10| So I think there was a lot of, you know, I think this body spoke at that time and gave direction to the signed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12490)|
| 3:28:18| I think the signed task force has done great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12498)|
| 3:28:22| But on this issue, they certainly drifted from what council approved in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12502)|
| 3:28:28| Where I am on the issue, you know, I look around, and the thing I keep coming back to is Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12508)|
| 3:28:37| Turkey Creek, to me, is the most successful retail area in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12517)|
| 3:28:44| And they only allow six-foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12524)|
| 3:28:49| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12529)|
| 3:28:52| Is that because, I mean, if big tall signs are so good for business, why did Turkey Creek do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12532)|
| 3:29:01| And why is Turkey Creek so successful with six-foot tall signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12541)|
| 3:29:05| Because it lives in the middle of the most wealthy area in the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12545)|
| 3:29:09| It has to do, I don't think it was an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12549)|
| 3:29:12| I think the developers at Turkey Creek knew what is good for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12552)|
| 3:29:16| And that is forcing the tenants to use low signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12556)|
| 3:29:23| And so I just keep coming back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| Of course, I mean, no one, I don't want to hurt business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12565)|
| 3:29:29| But our major arterials, you know, the federal highways, Kingston Pike, Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12569)|
| 3:29:34| this is what people are concerned about, Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12574)|
| 3:29:37| And I think we need to take, you know, major steps to try to reduce the sign clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12577)|
| 3:29:43| And the trend is clear all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12583)|
| 3:29:46| And to me, you know, I would be in favor of just monument signs in the six- to 12-foot range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12586)|
| 3:29:53| for everything that's not adjacent to an interstate or at an interstate interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12593)|
| 3:29:58| And then for those, maybe 20, 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| So that's where I am on those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| And I'm not going to make a motion because I don't know where everybody else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12603)|
| 3:30:10| Let's have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12610)|
| 3:30:11| Then we'll need a motion in order to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12611)|
| 3:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12614)|
| 3:30:15| Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12615)|
| 3:30:16| My colleague, Mr. Marshall, here, is correct in terms of the vote that was taken back at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12616)|
| 3:30:23| That vote was also taken without the thorough kind of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12623)|
| 3:30:27| and knowledge that had gone on since the task force has been in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12627)|
| 3:30:33| One of the outcome of that particular vote was the fact that we did need a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12633)|
| 3:30:38| and we did need to look at the overall ordinance to see where we are and where we were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| And I think in my own situation where we've looked at sign heights, we've looked at cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12642)|
| 3:30:50| we've discussed this, we've discussed it among the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12650)|
| 3:30:55| I firmly believe that the task force worked on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12655)|
| 3:30:59| and that as a member of that task force and as chairman and knowing how the process works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12659)|
| 3:31:06| I think that one of the things that we need to take into very, very serious consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12666)|
| 3:31:11| is the work that they did and the fact that they did what they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12671)|
| 3:31:15| and they came up with the solutions that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12675)|
| 3:31:18| I think one of the things that really made me realize in terms of what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12678)|
| 3:31:23| I understand what Marshall is saying about monument signs and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12683)|
| 3:31:28| In fact, it was interesting, we had a discussion once at the sign task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12688)|
| 3:31:32| where we all said that, you know, wouldn't it be nice if we had lower signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12692)|
| 3:31:36| We also came to the conclusion that part of the problem that we have out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12696)|
| 3:31:40| which we haven't addressed yet and I guess maybe by 11 o'clock we might get to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12700)|
| 3:31:44| has to do with abandoned signs and signs that are not permitted properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12704)|
| 3:31:50| and the maintenance of those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12710)|
| 3:31:52| Right now, if you go out, there's no doubt that we all want to see our city looking better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12712)|
| 3:31:58| and to have a much better face on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12718)|
| 3:32:01| But right now what happens is there's not a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12721)|
| 3:32:05| Turkey Creek was a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12725)|
| 3:32:08| It started out as a big field and so the developers out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12728)|
| 3:32:11| could determine what the heights of the signs were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12731)|
| 3:32:14| The work that we've done at Cheryl Hill in terms of working with those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12734)|
| 3:32:18| not only did the neighborhood groups work extremely hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12738)|
| 3:32:21| I worked on those to help get those signs lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12741)|
| 3:32:24| And again, it was a different playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12744)|
| 3:32:27| It wasn't like Broadway, Kingston, Pike, even in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12747)|
| 3:32:31| And when we talk about Bearden, the work that all of us did to talk with Chick-fil-A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12751)|
| 3:32:35| in terms of being more sensitive to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12755)|
| 3:32:39| and be more sensitive to the area in which they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12759)|
| 3:32:42| that that was the work that was done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12762)|
| 3:32:44| But if you have a business that's going in and they're sitting there in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12764)|
| 3:32:49| between two businesses that have much higher signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12769)|
| 3:32:53| and you tell that person you can only have a six-foot sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| as much as I don't like signs, I have come to an understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12776)|
| 3:33:00| of how important it is for these small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12780)|
| 3:33:03| to have signs of a certain height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| Now, we can discuss what that height is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12785)|
| 3:33:08| But again, it's a total different situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12788)|
| 3:33:12| when you have a Turkey Creek of 100 acres of clear land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12792)|
| 3:33:16| where a developer can come in and say what has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12796)|
| 3:33:19| Or even out where we're talking about with Cheryl Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12799)|
| 3:33:22| where we have the Kroger's and that was vacant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12802)|
| 3:33:25| where they could go in there and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| And so I think the other thing that I came about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| and I think I've mentioned this to you folks before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12810)|
| 3:33:32| but the sign task force looked at almost 6,000 building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12812)|
| 3:33:36| over the last 12 years, 6,000 building permits that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12816)|
| 3:33:41| And we looked at those permits from the standpoint of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12821)|
| 3:33:44| which ones were pole signs and which ones were monument signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12824)|
| 3:33:48| and what were the height of those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12828)|
| 3:33:50| And out of those 6,000 signs, 723 requests over a 12-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12830)|
| 3:33:56| were for pole signs or monument signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12836)|
| 3:34:00| I did not go into separating which ones were poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12840)|
| 3:34:03| and which ones were monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| This, by the way, is not totally scientific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12845)|
| 3:34:07| if the lawyers are sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12847)|
| 3:34:09| It's something that we just went through page by page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12849)|
| 3:34:11| to see what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| And we had to sign people up at the codes people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12853)|
| 3:34:16| not the sign people out in the business world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12856)|
| 3:34:18| but the codes people actually help us with this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12858)|
| 3:34:20| But what was interesting is that 83% of all those signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12860)|
| 3:34:24| were less than 30 feet, were less than 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12864)|
| 3:34:27| They weren't asking for tall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| No, and 77% were less than 24 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12869)|
| 3:34:34| And one of the things or several things I've learned through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12874)|
| 3:34:38| is if you really think about it, most of the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12878)|
| 3:34:41| and you can go and talk to some of the sign folks like we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12881)|
| 3:34:45| are less than 24 feet because of the sight lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12885)|
| 3:34:49| When you drive down your car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12889)|
| 3:34:51| if Chick-fil-A had a 50-foot sign in your Kroger's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| you're not going to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12893)|
| 3:34:55| So we've lowered the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12895)|
| 3:34:57| Now, do we want to lower them than 30 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12897)|
| 3:34:59| That's going to be the will of the council here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12899)|
| 3:35:02| But the point is that what we did find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12902)|
| 3:35:06| was the fact that businesses in the particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12906)|
| 3:35:09| at least want to have a level playing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12909)|
| 3:35:12| where they can compete with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12912)|
| 3:35:14| And if you're going to say to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12914)|
| 3:35:16| Duane, your office is going to go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12916)|
| 3:35:18| but you can only have a 6-foot sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12918)|
| 3:35:20| and Nick, the two Nicks, are on either side of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12920)|
| 3:35:23| and they have a 22-foot sign, then I'm at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12923)|
| 3:35:27| Now, I can understand where people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| well, you're not at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12929)|
| 3:35:31| Your sign might look nicer or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12931)|
| 3:35:33| The other thing to consider, before I forget it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12933)|
| 3:35:35| while I still have the floor, we have the sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12935)|
| 3:35:39| We're no longer going to have poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| They have to have a shroud on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| We've said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12943)|
| 3:35:44| We've looked at that as part of the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12944)|
| 3:35:46| We don't want to see these popsicles anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12946)|
| 3:35:48| We want to see a shroud around a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12948)|
| 3:35:51| We've also said you've got to landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12951)|
| 3:35:54| Now, you can't just have your poles sitting in asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12954)|
| 3:35:57| You've got to have a landscape area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| that's at least half the size of the face of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12959)|
| 3:36:02| We've also gone ahead and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12962)|
| 3:36:05| what you have to do in order to maintain that sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12965)|
| 3:36:08| and what we have to do in order to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12968)|
| 3:36:11| all these illegal or legal nonconforming signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12971)|
| 3:36:14| that are out there that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12974)|
| 3:36:17| That's where all the clutter is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12977)|
| 3:36:18| That's where we're having real problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12978)|
| 3:36:20| is we're having these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12980)|
| 3:36:22| Drive down any one of our streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12982)|
| 3:36:23| and look at the number of abandoned signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12983)|
| 3:36:26| and we're now working on that to try to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12986)|
| 3:36:29| To me, and this is what I want my friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12989)|
| 3:36:32| at Scenic Knoxville to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12992)|
| 3:36:34| to me it's more important to take care of the trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12994)|
| 3:36:36| that we have sitting up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12996)|
| 3:36:39| instead of trying to say that, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12999)|
| 3:36:41| you can only have a six-foot sign on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13001)|
| 3:36:44| or a six-foot sign on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13004)|
| 3:36:46| We have another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13006)|
| 3:36:48| Just like we have the Cumberland overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13008)|
| 3:36:51| we can look at the possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13011)|
| 3:36:53| For instance, Bearden is really ripe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13013)|
| 3:36:55| to have an overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| And in that overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| you have the opportunity to work with the business people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13019)|
| 3:37:02| the residential people, to sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13022)|
| 3:37:04| just like they did on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| I think Ann can probably address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13026)|
| 3:37:08| You can have an overlay that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13028)|
| 3:37:10| regardless of what our sign ordinance says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| you can say, okay, we're not going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13032)|
| 3:37:14| any more than 12-foot high signs or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13034)|
| 3:37:16| But you get all those people together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13036)|
| 3:37:18| to help make that decision in terms of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13038)|
| 3:37:21| So that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13041)|
| 3:37:24| But I don't have a motion, Mayor, yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13044)|
| 3:37:26| Okay. Let me just counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13046)|
| 3:37:29| Ms. English has been here four hours with us as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13049)|
| 3:37:32| and has not spoken yet, so without objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13052)|
| 3:37:34| I'd like to allow her to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13056)|
| 3:37:38| Mary English, 810 Oak Grove in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13058)|
| 3:37:42| And I'm glad that Councilman Grieve brought up the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13062)|
| 3:37:46| It brings up the point that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13066)|
| 3:37:48| that is now a federal highway, Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13068)|
| 3:37:52| could become a mixed-use residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13072)|
| 3:37:55| And so it's very important in thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13075)|
| 3:37:59| this very difficult sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13079)|
| 3:38:03| to think ahead to what roads may become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13083)|
| 3:38:07| because you guys don't want to revisit this soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13087)|
| 3:38:10| But even federal highways like Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13090)|
| 3:38:14| or possibly Chapman Highway close in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| are going to become, if the Bearden situation works out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13097)|
| 3:38:21| it's going to become mixed-use, more vibrant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13101)|
| 3:38:25| but also the lollipops are going to fit in even less then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13105)|
| 3:38:29| So thanks for all that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13112)|
| 3:38:34| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13114)|
| 3:38:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13116)|
| 3:38:38| Dwayne, I appreciate what you've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13118)|
| 3:38:40| and I extremely appreciate the work that the committee has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13120)|
| 3:38:44| I think the goal here by everybody at this table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13124)|
| 3:38:47| and everybody in this room is to begin to clean the clutter up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13127)|
| 3:38:53| We all admit we're cluttered, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13133)|
| 3:38:57| We have some differences on what we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| to be appropriate height and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13140)|
| 3:39:03| The suggestion that Councilman Stair just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13143)|
| 3:39:08| the height, the numbers you reiterated from 2011, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13148)|
| 3:39:14| I am very comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13154)|
| 3:39:17| I'm not so comfortable with the suggestion we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13157)|
| 3:39:20| although it's certainly a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| So I applaud the work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13165)|
| 3:39:28| You didn't quite say it, but we've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13168)|
| 3:39:32| We're starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13172)|
| 3:39:34| I'm not going to make a motion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13174)|
| 3:39:37| I would like to begin to get this stuff a little bit lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13177)|
| 3:39:42| We will have to work on it, as Vice Mayor Pavlis has said numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13182)|
| 3:39:46| We're going to have to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13186)|
| 3:39:47| Overlays are a great possibility as we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13187)|
| 3:39:51| but this is a wonderful opportunity to begin that process of decluttering our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13191)|
| 3:39:59| That's part of the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13199)|
| 3:40:00| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13200)|
| 3:40:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13201)|
| 3:40:02| I just would like to concur and throw my weight behind those 2011 numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13202)|
| 3:40:07| Ten to 25 feet is plenty in all zones, applicable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13207)|
| 3:40:11| and I don't know, like Marshall said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13211)|
| 3:40:13| if we're at the six to 12-foot monument signs yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13213)|
| 3:40:16| but I think it sounds like a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13216)|
| 3:40:21| You've got to start somewhere going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13221)|
| 3:40:24| so I think that's what we're here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13224)|
| 3:40:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13228)|
| 3:40:29| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13229)|
| 3:40:30| I find it funny that we're talking about overlay zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13230)|
| 3:40:33| I sat up here as about the only one that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| why don't we vote on it, and you all tabled it and sent it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13235)|
| 3:40:38| and then we redrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13238)|
| 3:40:40| I mean, I sat right here and said, why don't we do this overlay loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13240)|
| 3:40:44| and it was like, oh, nobody wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13244)|
| 3:40:46| And I said, yeah, people do want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13246)|
| 3:40:48| and it's something to look forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13248)|
| 3:40:52| You were right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13252)|
| 3:40:53| I was right, absolutely, and that's what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13253)|
| 3:40:55| Okay, for consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13255)|
| 3:40:57| It's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| All right, Stair, you want to go back to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13259)|
| 3:41:03| I mean, do you want to accept these road classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13263)|
| 3:41:06| as originally presented within 500 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13266)|
| 3:41:10| 100 feet of the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13270)|
| 3:41:14| and then collector and arterial roads and all local roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13274)|
| 3:41:17| is that the four classifications you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13277)|
| 3:41:19| Are you happy with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13279)|
| 3:41:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| I thought we were talking about federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| It was federal highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13284)|
| 3:41:25| Federal highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13285)|
| 3:41:26| Property fronting federal highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13286)|
| 3:41:27| Property fronting federal highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13287)|
| 3:41:31| Do you still think that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13291)|
| 3:41:32| I mean, it's either that or you're into the Wayne's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13292)|
| 3:41:37| you know, it's 30 feet, 40 and 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13297)|
| 3:41:40| I mean, otherwise, or you can break it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13300)|
| 3:41:42| We can take C1 and C2 and look at it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13302)|
| 3:41:45| If we want to look at that, we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13305)|
| 3:41:48| I mean, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13308)|
| 3:41:49| We can take the O's and decide what we want over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13309)|
| 3:41:53| We can take C1, C2, pull that out, C3, C4, C5, do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13313)|
| 3:41:58| or industrial, you know, if that's the way we want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| or we can do it by road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13321)|
| 3:42:05| Or you just keep it simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13325)|
| 3:42:08| which I don't know that that's the right way to do it long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13328)|
| 3:42:11| Keeping it simple is really not going to get you the desired results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13331)|
| 3:42:17| But, I mean, Stair, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13337)|
| 3:42:20| I think, do we need to make a motion for the four road classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13340)|
| 3:42:23| as they were in 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13343)|
| 3:42:26| Which are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13346)|
| 3:42:27| To repeat that, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13347)|
| 3:42:30| Want property within an interstate interchange area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13350)|
| 3:42:36| Property adjacent to an interstate right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13356)|
| 3:42:41| Property fronting federal highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13361)|
| 3:42:46| And all other eligible property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13366)|
| 3:42:52| What you're eliminating is the arterial collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13372)|
| 3:42:55| No arterial language or collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13375)|
| 3:42:58| Okay, and then after, if this gets passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13378)|
| 3:43:01| then you have to say what the heights are for each of those, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| Is that not the next step, then, if this gets passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13384)|
| 3:43:07| Yes, I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13387)|
| 3:43:08| Just so we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13388)|
| 3:43:09| And you're saying that for all the C's and the I's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13389)|
| 3:43:12| is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13392)|
| 3:43:13| You're eliminating O's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13393)|
| 3:43:16| The O's have already been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13396)|
| 3:43:18| This is all in Section 55.6, or 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13398)|
| 3:43:22| Okay, 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13402)|
| 3:43:25| And C's, maximum sign heights for primary detached signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13405)|
| 3:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13409)|
| 3:43:33| Okay, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13413)|
| 3:43:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13417)|
| 3:43:39| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13419)|
| 3:43:40| Okay, Mayor, first of all, I want to correct my colleague, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13420)|
| 3:43:44| It's not Duane's solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13424)|
| 3:43:46| It's the task force that presented this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13426)|
| 3:43:49| I'm just the carrier of that, of what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13429)|
| 3:43:53| I'm still concerned about what's a federal highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13433)|
| 3:43:56| I mean, it's just like Ms. English brought up, Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13436)|
| 3:43:59| Is that going to be a federal highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13439)|
| 3:44:01| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13441)|
| 3:44:02| And, you know, it's adjacent to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13442)|
| 3:44:05| It goes right through Sequoia Hills, Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13445)|
| 3:44:08| I find it very difficult to vote on this not knowing exactly what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13448)|
| 3:44:13| And I'd like to ask the law department how easy this is going to be for them on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13453)|
| 3:44:17| until we have the classifications of what these roads are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13457)|
| 3:44:21| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13461)|
| 3:44:25| I thought Krista was doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13465)|
| 3:44:27| We're giving her a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13467)|
| 3:44:29| But, no, I'm being serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13471)|
| 3:44:32| How are we going to classify all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13472)|
| 3:44:37| I'm not sure I know the answer to that question because I'm not sure that I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13477)|
| 3:44:43| maybe because it's lack of preparation, but I don't know the definitions for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13483)|
| 3:44:49| I don't know exactly what that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13489)|
| 3:44:52| And unless I know exactly what that's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13492)|
| 3:44:56| I don't know how I tell someone who wants to get a sign permit what they can do and what they can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13496)|
| 3:45:01| unless I know exactly what that street is and where it fits within what you're proposing to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13501)|
| 3:45:07| Now, I would invite Krista to come in because she has studied this extensively and more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13507)|
| 3:45:17| But do you believe that there is some ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13517)|
| 3:45:20| some problem with the ability to define what we're exactly talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13520)|
| 3:45:25| Well, I think you're right that we would need to have these terms defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13525)|
| 3:45:29| because I don't think they are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13529)|
| 3:45:32| And I also think that there's, you know, thinking of this particular, these district types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13532)|
| 3:45:42| the commercial and industrial districts, where these are adjacent to some type of other zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13542)|
| 3:45:49| where we're not classifying it by the roadway that it's adjacent to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13549)|
| 3:45:54| Is that going to create an enforcement, additional enforcement burden, for lack of a better word, for our staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13554)|
| 3:46:04| Where in some districts we have these, you know, we're just using the zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13564)|
| 3:46:10| and then here where office abuts commercial, then we're kind of switching gears, treating it in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13570)|
| 3:46:18| I think that's an additional consideration, but I think that we need to flesh out these terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13578)|
| 3:46:25| Well, I mean, you face those same problems for office next to an interstate, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13585)|
| 3:46:30| You know, I think there's those issues and, you know, we're not, I'm not pulling this out of thin air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13590)|
| 3:46:38| This is directly from the ordinance that this body passed in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13598)|
| 3:46:44| With MPC's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13604)|
| 3:46:45| With MPC's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13605)|
| 3:46:47| Read C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13607)|
| 3:46:48| From, you know, looking at, and it says properties which affront the following federal designated highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13608)|
| 3:46:55| U.S. 441, Chapman Highway, Henley, Broadway, U.S. 7011, Kingston Pike, but not Magnolia Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13615)|
| 3:47:01| U.S. 11E, Asheville Highway, U.S. 11W, Rutledge Pike, U.S. 25W, Clinton Highway, and Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13621)|
| 3:47:08| but not Magnolia Avenue, and U.S. 129, Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13628)|
| 3:47:13| In terms of enforcement, just right now, if you're next to an interstate, you get an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13633)|
| 3:47:19| You can go 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13639)|
| 3:47:20| If you're in office next to an interstate, I don't think you get to go 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13640)|
| 3:47:24| So it's the same problem given the current structure of this sign ordinance as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13644)|
| 3:47:32| So, you know, I think those are issues we can get over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13652)|
| 3:47:35| I think we've already got, I mean, this already defines the interstate interchanges in the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13655)|
| 3:47:42| It already has the 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13662)|
| 3:47:44| It has everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13664)|
| 3:47:45| All we're adding is federal highways, and, you know, I think those are pretty well defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13665)|
| 3:47:54| I mean, I just listed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13674)|
| 3:47:55| They were listed in the 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13675)|
| 3:47:56| Do those definitions comport with what MPC uses now in terms of our road systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13676)|
| 3:48:03| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13683)|
| 3:48:06| Those are the federally numbered highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13686)|
| 3:48:08| Oh, I mean, the definitions he's using, the words he's using, so that we don't get confusion in our terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13688)|
| 3:48:18| Right now, the terms that we're talking about are federal highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13698)|
| 3:48:23| And all other streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13703)|
| 3:48:24| That's the same terminology that MPC uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13704)|
| 3:48:26| Well, a federal highway is designated as such, and those were listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13706)|
| 3:48:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13712)|
| 3:48:33| Councilman Serrett listed those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13713)|
| 3:48:34| If you need to, you could probably incorporate those into the body of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13714)|
| 3:48:41| If those are the roads that you want these to apply to specifically, then you could incorporate those roads in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13721)|
| 3:48:52| Just as an aside, if I'm not mistaken, in regards to Kingston Pike, as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13732)|
| 3:48:58| that section that I think you're concerned about, Dwayne, is a scenic highway also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13738)|
| 3:49:02| And that's addressed in this proposal as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13742)|
| 3:49:10| Is it clear what property within interstate interchange area is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13750)|
| 3:49:16| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13756)|
| 3:49:20| That's in the current proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13760)|
| 3:49:22| No, I know, but I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13762)|
| 3:49:24| No, where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13764)|
| 3:49:26| Where does it say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13766)|
| 3:49:27| It's section C, 116C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13767)|
| 3:49:32| 116C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13772)|
| 3:49:34| And it lists all the interstate interchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13774)|
| 3:49:37| Oh, they actually have a separate listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13777)|
| 3:49:40| Yeah, they're listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13780)|
| 3:49:41| One through six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| One through six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13782)|
| 3:49:50| So that was part of the designation by roadway classification you were talking about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13790)|
| 3:49:55| that it's not only zoned, but there was the classification of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13795)|
| 3:50:00| Like I've said all night, it's already done by road classification as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13800)|
| 3:50:07| And interstate could close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13807)|
| 3:50:11| Interstate could open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13811)|
| 3:50:12| They could close I-40 and then it's no longer an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13812)|
| 3:50:15| And this, you know, doesn't apply to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| I mean, it's the same argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13817)|
| 3:50:20| Okay, so there is a motion and a second on those classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13820)|
| 3:50:25| Is there more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13825)|
| 3:50:27| Councilman Grieve, is your light still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13827)|
| 3:50:29| I want to understand if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13829)|
| 3:50:32| What we're taking is C from the old city council November 2011 definition of federal highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13832)|
| 3:50:42| which came really from MPC, right, and the classification of interchanges that's in 116C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13842)|
| 3:50:53| which is listed one to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13853)|
| 3:50:55| Those two sets of classifications are what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13855)|
| 3:50:59| And the other one is the federally designated highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13859)|
| 3:51:04| Those sets of classifications we're adopting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13864)|
| 3:51:13| Is that what you're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13873)|
| 3:51:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13874)|
| 3:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13881)|
| 3:51:23| We're not talking about the height, but we're talking about those are the classifications you want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13883)|
| 3:51:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13886)|
| 3:51:30| Okay, we have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13890)|
| 3:51:32| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13892)|
| 3:51:36| Repeat the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13896)|
| 3:51:39| Who would like to repeat the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13899)|
| 3:51:41| I'm not going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13901)|
| 3:51:44| To adopt different sign heights and sizes based on street classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13904)|
| 3:51:51| one within 500 feet of an interstate interchange, two adjacent to an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13911)|
| 3:51:58| Right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13918)|
| 3:52:00| Right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13920)|
| 3:52:02| Three adjacent to a federal designated highway, and four all other roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13922)|
| 3:52:06| Which is on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13926)|
| 3:52:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13927)|
| 3:52:09| Typed in blue on the screen is 11.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13929)|
| 3:52:16| Any clarification, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13936)|
| 3:52:19| The 2011 ordinance that I have states that a little bit differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13939)|
| 3:52:25| What needs to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13945)|
| 3:52:28| Well, all four of them are just a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13948)|
| 3:52:33| On the ordinance that was approved on first reading as amended, is that the one we're talking about in 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13953)|
| 3:52:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13958)|
| 3:52:40| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13960)|
| 3:52:41| Property within interstate interchange areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13961)|
| 3:52:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13963)|
| 3:52:44| Property adjacent to interstate right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13964)|
| 3:52:46| Fronting on federal highways and other eligible property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13966)|
| 3:52:50| That's what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13970)|
| 3:52:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13971)|
| 3:52:52| Fronting on federal designated highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13972)|
| 3:52:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13975)|
| 3:52:56| Is that the wording you want to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13976)|
| 3:52:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13978)|
| 3:52:59| From 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13979)|
| 3:53:01| Is that the way it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13981)|
| 3:53:04| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13984)|
| 3:53:06| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13986)|
| 3:53:08| The classification is without regard to height, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13988)|
| 3:53:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13991)|
| 3:53:12| Right now it's just classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13992)|
| 3:53:15| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13995)|
| 3:53:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13996)|
| 3:53:17| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13997)|
| 3:53:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13998)|
| 3:53:19| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=13999)|
| 3:53:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14000)|
| 3:53:21| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14001)|
| 3:53:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14002)|
| 3:53:23| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14003)|
| 3:53:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14004)|
| 3:53:25| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14005)|
| 3:53:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14006)|
| 3:53:27| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14007)|
| 3:53:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14008)|
| 3:53:29| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14009)|
| 3:53:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14010)|
| 3:53:31| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14011)|
| 3:53:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14012)|
| 3:53:33| Okay, that passes 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14013)|
| 3:53:36| Now, we need heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14016)|
| 3:53:45| Is this any easy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14025)|
| 3:53:46| Who wants to make a motion or discussion on heights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14026)|
| 3:53:57| I'd like to go ahead and recognize Ms. Fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14037)|
| 3:54:00| She's been standing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14040)|
| 3:54:02| Okay, Ms. Fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14042)|
| 3:54:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14043)|
| 3:54:04| I will try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14044)|
| 3:54:07| Okay, I won't go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14047)|
| 3:54:10| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14050)|
| 3:54:11| As Councilman Grieve said, we looked at 6,000 permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14051)|
| 3:54:16| covered archival data over five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14056)|
| 3:54:19| and 80% were for less than 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14059)|
| 3:54:24| So most of what we see on our roadways today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14064)|
| 3:54:29| are signs that are between 25 and 30 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14069)|
| 3:54:33| That's the majority of what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14073)|
| 3:54:35| We do have some 50-foot signs, but we have more 25- and 30-foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14075)|
| 3:54:40| The clutter that you see today that everybody thinks is so ugly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14080)|
| 3:54:44| and that the community has weighed in strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14084)|
| 3:54:47| and told you they don't like is due to 25- to 30-foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14087)|
| 3:54:52| So what the current proposal is is 40 and 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14092)|
| 3:54:55| So what it is is it's just more of the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14095)|
| 3:54:58| and it's not going to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14098)|
| 3:55:04| Addressing something that Councilman Grieve said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14104)|
| 3:55:06| there's no evidence that smaller signs do worse compared to or next to larger signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14106)|
| 3:55:12| There are a lot of businesses that go in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14112)|
| 3:55:15| I can name you several that open up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14115)|
| 3:55:18| and they willingly and voluntarily put in monument signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14118)|
| 3:55:21| even though they're next to 30- to 40-foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14121)|
| 3:55:24| That's a choice they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14124)|
| 3:55:25| They don't seem to be suffering economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14125)|
| 3:55:28| Their businesses seem to be thriving nonetheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14128)|
| 3:55:34| I guess those are the main—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14134)|
| 3:55:36| Oh, as you all know, these existing signs are grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14136)|
| 3:55:41| We have to do something radically different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14141)|
| 3:55:43| We have to do something significantly different, or we're never going to see any change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14143)|
| 3:55:48| because the change that's going to happen is going to happen so slowly over time to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14148)|
| 3:55:53| So let's not just do more of what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14153)|
| 3:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14157)|
| 3:55:58| Thank you, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14158)|
| 3:56:00| I think we have a counter-argument here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14160)|
| 3:56:03| Mark Field, 10324 Washington Pike, Corryton 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14163)|
| 3:56:12| The statement that was just made is just summarily not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14172)|
| 3:56:14| There's a study from San Diego State University as well as University of Cincinnati| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14174)|
| 3:56:18| that were both done in 2013 and 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14178)|
| 3:56:22| You can Google signage, importance of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14182)|
| 3:56:26| You can Google importance of signage, signage size to revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14186)|
| 3:56:32| and see multiple studies that have been done, but particularly the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14192)|
| 3:56:36| one at San Diego State University and University of Cincinnati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14196)|
| 3:56:39| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14199)|
| 3:56:44| Mayor, I still don't know what the sign height is he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14204)|
| 3:56:47| What are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14207)|
| 3:56:49| You don't know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14209)|
| 3:56:50| The sign height he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14210)|
| 3:56:53| I mean, everyone's saying what we have, what works or doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14213)|
| 3:56:57| what is clutter or isn't clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14217)|
| 3:57:00| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14220)|
| 3:57:01| The proposal before us says 40 and 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| What is the proposal being made to change that to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14223)|
| 3:57:06| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14226)|
| 3:57:07| I've not had it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14227)|
| 3:57:08| A motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14228)|
| 3:57:10| Yes, Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14230)|
| 3:57:11| I make a motion that we follow what the signed task force came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14231)|
| 3:57:16| and has worked for three and a half years and has studied this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14236)|
| 3:57:20| I make a motion that property within 500 feet of the interstate interchange area be 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14240)|
| 3:57:28| Property adjacent to the interstate right of way, 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14248)|
| 3:57:31| Property fronting on federal designated highways, 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14251)|
| 3:57:34| All other roadway classifications, 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14254)|
| 3:57:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14257)|
| 3:57:42| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14262)|
| 3:57:44| Conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14264)|
| 3:57:46| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14266)|
| 3:57:47| I'm going to vote against this because I'm going to propose something significantly lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14267)|
| 3:57:56| Mr. Weigels, you are recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14276)|
| 3:57:59| I would like to give you some specific examples, real life examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14279)|
| 3:58:05| I have a store, a convenience store, gasoline store at the corner of Smith Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14285)|
| 3:58:12| and Kingston Pike and Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14292)|
| 3:58:16| I was required to use a monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14296)|
| 3:58:20| On that sign, I'm allowed only enough room to post one price of one of the products we sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14300)|
| 3:58:30| That is a very good location in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14310)|
| 3:58:33| I think all of you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14313)|
| 3:58:34| We've won the landscaping award two years in a row, the best landscape two years in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14314)|
| 3:58:42| That store with eight pumps is pumping less than the two-pump store that we just closed on Wesley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14322)|
| 3:58:52| We have lost money for all six years that we've been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14332)|
| 3:58:57| Anybody that wants to check those P&Ls is welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14337)|
| 3:59:01| If we cannot, in my particular business, advertise the four grades of gas that we carry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14341)|
| 3:59:09| we can't sell those grades of gas because nobody knows the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14349)|
| 3:59:14| and nobody knows what we're selling them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14354)|
| 3:59:17| It's a very competitive business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14357)|
| 3:59:20| If there were no gas sign price signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14360)|
| 3:59:23| I can guarantee you we'd all be making a whole lot more money because we wouldn't be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14363)|
| 3:59:29| It's a very, very competitive business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14369)|
| 3:59:32| We happen to be very competitive on our gas price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14372)|
| 3:59:36| If not allowed to do that, well, there's no reason to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14376)|
| 3:59:42| Real life, two-pumper on Wesley Road, a lousy-looking store, worn out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14382)|
| 3:59:49| and a first-class store on Smith Road, one of the best stores in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14389)|
| 3:59:57| I want to tell you a little story, too, about the sign committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14397)|
| 4:00:01| We were stuck on a 30% decrease in height for probably two-and-a-half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14401)|
| 4:00:10| And finally, after about the third year, our chairman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14410)|
| 4:00:18| What about a 40-foot height sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14418)|
| 4:00:27| Nobody wanted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14427)|
| 4:00:29| What about a 35-foot sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14429)|
| 4:00:32| And then finally, he looked over at me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14432)|
| 4:00:36| We had been stuck on 35 foot for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14436)|
| 4:00:40| He said, Billy, would you go with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14440)|
| 4:00:47| And I said, Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14447)|
| 4:00:53| And at that time, we voted on sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14453)|
| 4:00:57| That vote was six to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14457)|
| 4:01:01| Am I right, Cindy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14461)|
| 4:01:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14464)|
| 4:01:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14466)|
| 4:01:08| Now, after that meeting, I was walking out after I had let down the business community, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14468)|
| 4:01:17| and my head was kind of hanging, and I frankly did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14477)|
| 4:01:24| I frankly did it because Duane asked me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14484)|
| 4:01:28| And a lady that had been visiting our sign committee for many times motioned me over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14488)|
| 4:01:35| and said, I want to compliment you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14495)|
| 4:01:40| And I said, Ma'am, what are you going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14500)|
| 4:01:43| That doesn't sound like good, you know, to a businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14503)|
| 4:01:45| There's something coming bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14505)|
| 4:01:47| And she said, A facilitator is charged, and I wrote this down because it was kind of relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14507)|
| 4:01:59| It meant a lot to me when she said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14519)|
| 4:02:01| She said there's three things a facilitator is charged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14521)|
| 4:02:05| One of them is endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14525)|
| 4:02:09| One of them is can you live with it, which means you don't like it, but can you live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14529)|
| 4:02:15| And one is widespread approval, and that's a super majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14535)|
| 4:02:21| And she said, You all just did what I teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14541)|
| 4:02:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14548)|
| 4:02:29| Her name was Mary English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14549)|
| 4:02:39| I object to that, but I don't want to take up the time with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14559)|
| 4:02:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14563)|
| 4:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14567)|
| 4:02:48| That's fine, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14568)|
| 4:02:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14569)|
| 4:02:50| So who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14570)|
| 4:02:51| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14571)|
| 4:02:52| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14572)|
| 4:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14576)|
| 4:02:57| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14577)|
| 4:02:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14578)|
| 4:02:59| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14579)|
| 4:03:00| Do we have a second to Councilman Grieve's height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14580)|
| 4:03:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14582)|
| 4:03:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14583)|
| 4:03:04| Everybody know there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14584)|
| 4:03:05| Are they there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14585)|
| 4:03:06| They're there before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14586)|
| 4:03:08| Forty, thirty, thirty, thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14588)|
| 4:03:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14591)|
| 4:03:12| Forty and all thirties after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14592)|
| 4:03:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14594)|
| 4:03:15| Then we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14595)|
| 4:03:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14596)|
| 4:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14597)|
| 4:03:18| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14598)|
| 4:03:19| It is what is in the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| Basically what this is, but it's by the classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14601)|
| 4:03:27| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14607)|
| 4:03:29| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14609)|
| 4:03:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14610)|
| 4:03:31| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14611)|
| 4:03:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14613)|
| 4:03:34| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14614)|
| 4:03:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14615)|
| 4:03:36| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14616)|
| 4:03:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14617)|
| 4:03:38| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14618)|
| 4:03:41| Yes on the first three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14621)|
| 4:03:44| I'm still mulling the fourth classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14624)|
| 4:03:46| Is that a yes or a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14626)|
| 4:03:48| I go yes at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14628)|
| 4:03:49| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14629)|
| 4:03:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14630)|
| 4:03:51| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14631)|
| 4:03:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14632)|
| 4:03:53| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14633)|
| 4:03:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14634)|
| 4:03:55| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14635)|
| 4:03:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14636)|
| 4:03:57| It's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14637)|
| 4:03:58| Five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14638)|
| 4:04:00| It's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14640)|
| 4:04:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14641)|
| 4:04:02| I'd like to make a motion to amend that to 25, 20, 15, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14642)|
| 4:04:09| That's reconsidering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14649)|
| 4:04:10| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14650)|
| 4:04:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14651)|
| 4:04:12| I mean, that's voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14652)|
| 4:04:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14653)|
| 4:04:14| You'd have to do a motion to reconsider, and that'd have to be put forth by someone on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14654)|
| 4:04:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14659)|
| 4:04:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14660)|
| 4:04:21| I guess I'll change my vote to yes and make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14661)|
| 4:04:28| Skinning a cat a new way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14668)|
| 4:04:30| It's too late to change his vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14670)|
| 4:04:32| We just went through all that to change the classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14672)|
| 4:04:36| We ended up with the same 40 and 30 that we started off with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14676)|
| 4:04:39| I think we can do much, much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14679)|
| 4:04:43| You know, I was going to propose, you know, the scenic Knoxville, 25, 20, 15, and 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14683)|
| 4:04:51| You know, I was going to propose, you know, the scenic Knoxville, 25, 20, 15, and 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14691)|
| 4:04:59| to really take, you know, take a positive step reducing sign heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14699)|
| 4:05:06| 30-foot signs, communities all the time work for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14706)|
| 4:05:10| They never work for a 30-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14710)|
| 4:05:13| That is still sky high, ugly, and obnoxious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14713)|
| 4:05:17| And, you know, I just don't think that's, I mean, what we passed back in 2011 was 25, 20, 15, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14717)|
| 4:05:29| Councilmember Pavlis, Councilmember Grieve voted for those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14729)|
| 4:05:34| It passed 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14734)|
| 4:05:37| You know, how are we at 40 and 30 now, you know, is very disappointing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14737)|
| 4:05:45| And, you know, I'd ask somebody voting on the yes side of that to reconsider to really address the whole problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14745)|
| 4:05:54| This whole thing was started over with sign heights, and 40 and 30 does nothing, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14754)|
| 4:06:01| Okay, but unless somebody who was, you can't, both of our attorneys here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14761)|
| 4:06:07| your attorney and city attorney says that you cannot change your vote now, so it would be up to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14767)|
| 4:06:14| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14774)|
| 4:06:15| Well, I'm just going to address Councilman Starr's answer to his question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14775)|
| 4:06:21| I mean, that was prior to three and a half years of hard work of civilians, I mean, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14781)|
| 4:06:27| unelected folks, and I'm sorry about the civilian part, but, I mean, I respect the work that they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14787)|
| 4:06:34| I don't know how we're ever going to ask anybody other than a non, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14794)|
| 4:06:39| any non-elected person to serve on a committee this important if we just totally trash and throw out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14799)|
| 4:06:47| and we haven't done that, but we're at a very critical stage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14807)|
| 4:06:52| And, again, I mean, it was voted on by this committee, the Committee 62, and I'm not going to throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14812)|
| 4:07:00| And I understand I may have voted for it then, but goodness gracious, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14820)|
| 4:07:04| there's been a lot of water over the dam since that time and a lot of tremendous hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14824)|
| 4:07:09| by people who will be affected greatly on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14829)|
| 4:07:14| So, I mean, that's why I'm willing now to, I mean, we've made concessions all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14834)|
| 4:07:20| So I appreciate what you're saying in bringing that forward, but that's the difference in my vote now as opposed to then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14840)|
| 4:07:28| Mayor, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14848)|
| 4:07:30| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14850)|
| 4:07:32| Yeah, just quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14852)|
| 4:07:33| The one thing that's worthy of comment, I suppose, is that these road classifications also comport a sense of speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14853)|
| 4:07:43| and the length of time you have to absorb the information on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14863)|
| 4:07:48| So I understand the interstate 40-footer, you've got cars going 60 or faster, even if the speed limit's 55 or 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14868)|
| 4:07:59| and they have a short amount of time to see the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14879)|
| 4:08:02| And the other aspect of that is we are not Iowa, we are a hilly countryside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14882)|
| 4:08:08| and so you have this notion of the roadway could be elevated and they might not see your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14888)|
| 4:08:14| And I understand having a tall sign near the interstate, the first two categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14894)|
| 4:08:20| that makes a lot of sense to me just because we're East Tennessee and not Iowa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14900)|
| 4:08:26| Fronting on the federally designated highway has a similar aspect in terms of speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14906)|
| 4:08:32| It's probably at least a 45 or 50 mile an hour road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14912)|
| 4:08:36| When we get down to the fourth one, and here's where I had a little bit of hesitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14916)|
| 4:08:40| other roadway classifications, we might be going 25 or 30 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14920)|
| 4:08:45| and you might need somewhat lesser of a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14925)|
| 4:08:50| So I could see a different number there, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14930)|
| 4:08:54| If you're tooling around at 35 or 40 miles an hour and you've got a 20-foot sign in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14934)|
| 4:09:00| if you can't see it or read it, there's something wrong with your eyes, go to the eye doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14940)|
| 4:09:04| So you might make a distinction, and I realize the sign committee did a lot of wrestling with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14944)|
| 4:09:11| but you might make a distinction if you're using road classifications that smaller, slower roads need less sign height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14951)|
| 4:09:19| and you could lower that one somewhat if that was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14959)|
| 4:09:23| But that's my thought on it anyway, that speed and topography dictate the interstate signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14963)|
| 4:09:29| and the ones near the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14969)|
| 4:09:31| When you get to the federally designated highways, you've still got pretty quick-moving cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14971)|
| 4:09:36| When you get down to the lesser roads, there may be less reason to have a big sign or a tall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14976)|
| 4:09:44| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14984)|
| 4:09:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14985)|
| 4:09:47| You know, I really appreciate my colleagues and the discussion we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14987)|
| 4:09:52| and the discussion we've heard from those in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14992)|
| 4:09:55| But remember, we're going to have two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14995)|
| 4:09:58| This has to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14998)|
| 4:09:59| This is just going back to MPC with our comments, suggestions, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=14999)|
| 4:10:05| And so it's going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15005)|
| 4:10:06| I'm sure MPC will probably hold some sort of hearings and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15006)|
| 4:10:10| So we will have an opportunity to bring these up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15010)|
| 4:10:14| But I really do respect the conversation we've had, the votes we've taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15014)|
| 4:10:20| and this is where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15020)|
| 4:10:21| This is the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15021)|
| 4:10:23| So let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15023)|
| 4:10:26| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15026)|
| 4:10:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15027)|
| 4:10:28| I agree with Councilman Saunders and Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15028)|
| 4:10:32| We have had a robust discussion tonight, I guess would be the term for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15032)|
| 4:10:39| And as we talked about a long time ago, everybody won't be happy when they leave here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15039)|
| 4:10:43| They weren't happy when they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15043)|
| 4:10:45| So it's pretty much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15045)|
| 4:10:47| We've been together for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15047)|
| 4:10:49| I also want to say that Vice Mayor Pavlis echoed my thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15049)|
| 4:10:54| that we've had this task force work for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15054)|
| 4:11:00| and I really think that it will be difficult in the future to enlist people to serve on a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15060)|
| 4:11:09| if we just throw this out and pretend that it didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15069)|
| 4:11:12| So I have great concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15072)|
| 4:11:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15076)|
| 4:11:17| So are we moving on to Section 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15077)|
| 4:11:20| One short, real short quickie on 11-5B2i.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15080)|
| 4:11:28| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15088)|
| 4:11:29| 11-5B2i.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15089)|
| 4:11:34| And it's on page 30 already of the packet or 30 of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15094)|
| 4:11:38| I would, after the first semicolon in that sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15098)|
| 4:11:42| I would take out the remaining portion of that paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15102)|
| 4:11:46| so the proviso that gives you a pull sign for the first time, in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15106)|
| 4:11:52| in an office district should be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15112)|
| 4:11:55| You can put it back later if you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15115)|
| 4:11:56| but it seems like now all of a sudden we've changed the way we've treated signage for offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15116)|
| 4:12:02| and I think it would be better to drop the proviso, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15122)|
| 4:12:07| That would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15127)|
| 4:12:12| You would take out provided, however, and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15132)|
| 4:12:15| A property adjacent to a major arterial expressway interstate right to the end of that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15135)|
| 4:12:19| Counsel will have a chance to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15139)|
| 4:12:22| Otherwise, you'd be limited to a monument or column sign in that office detached sign situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15142)|
| 4:12:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15153)|
| 4:12:34| I'd like to recognize Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15154)|
| 4:12:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15157)|
| 4:12:39| Council members, as we sit here talking about sign clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15159)|
| 4:12:42| and how we don't want to put people at disadvantages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15162)|
| 4:12:46| if somebody is sitting in a commercial zone and somebody else moves in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15166)|
| 4:12:53| we don't want them to be at a disadvantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15173)|
| 4:12:55| and we're taking all of this into consideration and trying to look at a bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15175)|
| 4:12:59| For heaven's sakes, let's not introduce into the office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15179)|
| 4:13:02| where we have never, never allowed anything but a monument sign and signs on buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15182)|
| 4:13:10| Let's not introduce a pole sign, and let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15190)|
| 4:13:14| If you look at where some of the office zones are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15194)|
| 4:13:17| they're paper mill, they're middle brook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15197)|
| 4:13:20| they're all kinds of places where in our city they serve as a transition zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15200)|
| 4:13:26| between residential and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15206)|
| 4:13:29| But let me tell you why you don't want to introduce, I hope you won't introduce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15209)|
| 4:13:35| office signs, pole signs in the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15215)|
| 4:13:39| Once that use is introduced, and I don't care if you limit it to 100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15219)|
| 4:13:43| which is a darn big sign, and 10 feet in height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15223)|
| 4:13:48| the person who wants a variance can go request one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15228)|
| 4:13:53| As long as pole signs are not permitted as a use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15233)|
| 4:13:58| you can't get a variance to get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15238)|
| 4:14:02| I agree with what has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15242)|
| 4:14:04| Most of us, when we're going to some use in an office zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15244)|
| 4:14:07| we're not just tooling down the street and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15247)|
| 4:14:10| oh, heck, you know, I guess I do feel hungry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15250)|
| 4:14:13| or I guess, yeah, good time to buy some gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15253)|
| 4:14:16| Most of us know we're going to a doctor, we're going to an attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15256)|
| 4:14:19| we're going to somebody, dreadful as it may be that we're going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15259)|
| 4:14:22| but we have an appointment, and we have a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15262)|
| 4:14:26| and there is no need for a pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15266)|
| 4:14:30| Now, if they're on Broadway or Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15270)|
| 4:14:34| and somebody wants to get a pole sign in their zoned office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15274)|
| 4:14:37| and they can't get one, if they haven't already asked for a rezoning, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15277)|
| 4:14:41| So, again, if we're talking about controlling sign clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15281)|
| 4:14:45| and we're facing up to the fact that under 13.7208,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15285)|
| 4:14:49| we can't get rid of what's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15289)|
| 4:14:51| please explain to me why we would introduce these at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15291)|
| 4:14:55| into a zone that has never had them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15295)|
| 4:14:57| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15297)|
| 4:14:58| Are you agreeing with his motion, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15298)|
| 4:15:00| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15300)|
| 4:15:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15301)|
| 4:15:02| I just want to make sure that's what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15302)|
| 4:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15304)|
| 4:15:05| So what's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15305)|
| 4:15:09| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15309)|
| 4:15:10| Motion to strike the pole sign section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15310)|
| 4:15:12| everything from the proviso to the end of that sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15312)|
| 4:15:15| in section 11.5.B.2.i.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15315)|
| 4:15:27| Striking it from this section has implications for the following sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15327)|
| 4:15:30| Oh, in three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15330)|
| 4:15:32| What happens to the rest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15332)|
| 4:15:34| It looks like three dies, too, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15334)|
| 4:15:36| Well, that's a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15336)|
| 4:15:37| Yeah, three would get eliminated, and so would four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15337)|
| 4:15:39| And I think we'd want to modify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15339)|
| 4:15:42| just removing the detached sign there to just say monument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15342)|
| 4:15:47| any signs, because now it would, if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15347)|
| 4:15:50| would be limited to the monument or column sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15350)|
| 4:15:52| I think we can combine Romanet 1 and 2 to just say monument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15352)|
| 4:15:59| or column signs limited to 36 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15359)|
| 4:16:02| So you'd simplify the whole sub 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15362)|
| 4:16:06| But, again, it would limit you to monument and column signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15366)|
| 4:16:08| and then it would give you the heights that were permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15368)|
| 4:16:11| And when you're talking about pole signs, it doesn't belong in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| so i drops out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15373)|
| 4:16:15| Excuse me, i, i, i drops out to number 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15375)|
| 4:16:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15378)|
| 4:16:19| And 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15379)|
| 4:16:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15380)|
| 4:16:21| 3 and 4 drops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15381)|
| 4:16:23| Combine 1 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15383)|
| 4:16:25| What's a detached sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15385)|
| 4:16:27| Is that different than?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15387)|
| 4:16:29| That's a ground or a pole sign, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15389)|
| 4:16:32| Isn't a monument sign detached or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15392)|
| 4:16:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15395)|
| 4:16:38| So it would have to deal with illuminating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15398)|
| 4:16:40| If it was illuminating, you wouldn't drop 4, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15400)|
| 4:16:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15402)|
| 4:16:43| So I think such detached signs is referring to the pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15403)|
| 4:16:48| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15408)|
| 4:16:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15410)|
| 4:16:51| Well, to keep it simple to my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15411)|
| 4:16:53| I move that we eliminate the pole signs from 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15413)|
| 4:16:57| excuse me, 11, 5, B, 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15417)|
| 4:17:00| and that may require some amending of supporting language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15420)|
| 4:17:04| but it would then give you monument and column signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15424)|
| 4:17:07| plus their sizes as set forth in 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15427)|
| 4:17:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15430)|
| 4:17:13| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15433)|
| 4:17:17| Well, I'm just confused then, Chairman Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15437)|
| 4:17:21| as to if it was, I'm just kind of curious as to why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15441)|
| 4:17:25| if it's never been in there and it was added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15445)|
| 4:17:29| and then you're seconding to take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15449)|
| 4:17:34| Mark explained to us that there were situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15454)|
| 4:17:37| that had office districts that were requesting larger signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15457)|
| 4:17:42| or requesting a pole sign that were on those particular roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15462)|
| 4:17:47| and that's what we've just recently gotten rid of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15467)|
| 4:17:49| so this needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15469)|
| 4:17:54| Mark Donaldson, by the way, MPC Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15474)|
| 4:17:57| Yes, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15477)|
| 4:18:00| You all know what you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15480)|
| 4:18:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15483)|
| 4:18:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15484)|
| 4:18:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15485)|
| 4:18:06| All right, that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15486)|
| 4:18:09| Now 12 is what you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15489)|
| 4:18:13| Okay, now are we on Section 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15493)|
| 4:18:15| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15495)|
| 4:18:17| Section 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15497)|
| 4:18:19| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15499)|
| 4:18:21| I want to make sure that folks understand that there was some concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15501)|
| 4:18:25| about scenic highways, and we're covering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15505)|
| 4:18:29| Are you on Section 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15509)|
| 4:18:31| Sorry, I'm still on Section 11 about scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15511)|
| 4:18:34| We have that covered in 116E2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15514)|
| 4:18:44| It's covered for our commercial and industrial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15524)|
| 4:18:50| And, Krista, would you address the fact that it's covered under office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15530)|
| 4:18:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15534)|
| 4:18:55| I think when we had spoken earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15535)|
| 4:18:57| we discussed that those same scenic highway provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15537)|
| 4:19:01| were not provided for in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15541)|
| 4:19:05| I think it's really moot at this point since there's not poll signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15545)|
| 4:19:09| But additionally, before we got to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15549)|
| 4:19:12| there were no signs that were allowed to be higher than 10 feet in the office district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15552)|
| 4:19:16| so there was no need to provide for lower signs pursuant to some scenic highway designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15556)|
| 4:19:22| You're saying it's moot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15562)|
| 4:19:24| Yes, since we eliminated the poll signs that are 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15564)|
| 4:19:27| I'll recognize Ms. Fels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15567)|
| 4:19:29| Ms. Fels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15569)|
| 4:19:31| Mr. Weigel first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15571)|
| 4:19:32| Can I make an apology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15572)|
| 4:19:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15574)|
| 4:19:35| I think what happened that night was that Duane asked this lady, who I didn't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15575)|
| 4:19:44| something about consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15584)|
| 4:19:46| Is that how this started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15586)|
| 4:19:48| And I misquoted by saying endorsement, can live with it, and widespread approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15588)|
| 4:19:56| I got them in reverse order, and she just said something nice to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15596)|
| 4:20:03| and I thought it concerned that particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15603)|
| 4:20:06| I don't think she teaches it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15606)|
| 4:20:08| I didn't really know who she was, and I want to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15608)|
| 4:20:12| I would never, ever try to misquote someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15612)|
| 4:20:16| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15616)|
| 4:20:17| Thank you, Mr. Weigel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15617)|
| 4:20:19| Ms. Fels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15619)|
| 4:20:21| I may be confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15621)|
| 4:20:22| Are we on scenic highways now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15622)|
| 4:20:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15625)|
| 4:20:26| We are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15626)|
| 4:20:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15627)|
| 4:20:29| I'm not sure why you would be confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15629)|
| 4:20:32| It's just my natural state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15632)|
| 4:20:37| What we're proposing is exactly what just, I believe, passed in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15637)|
| 4:20:44| In the office district, I think you all just passed six-foot monument signs, 36 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15644)|
| 4:20:50| and the wall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15650)|
| 4:20:52| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15652)|
| 4:20:54| Thirty-six square feet and a maximum height of six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15654)|
| 4:20:59| And then the wall sign section stays as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15659)|
| 4:21:04| Well, so what we're proposing is that the language that now applies to office districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15664)|
| 4:21:12| also applies to scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15672)|
| 4:21:16| I think it's criminal not to protect our scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15676)|
| 4:21:20| They're designated that way for a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15680)|
| 4:21:25| and we expect a lot of commercial activity to move into, for instance, Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15685)|
| 4:21:31| if Tenova builds there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15691)|
| 4:21:34| And I think it's really important that we don't allow that to turn into another Chapman Highway or Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15694)|
| 4:21:40| and that we protect it because it was designated a scenic highway for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15700)|
| 4:21:45| So the language that's in office districts is what we're supporting for scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15705)|
| 4:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15710)|
| 4:21:51| Is there a spot in this thing we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15711)|
| 4:21:53| I think what Joyce is referring to is if you go to 11-6C, no, E-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15713)|
| 4:22:05| we said on parcels and lots adjacent to any street or roads that are part of the state of Tennessee scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15725)|
| 4:22:10| the maximum sign height for a primary detached sign shall be ten feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15730)|
| 4:22:14| and the maximum sign area shall be 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15734)|
| 4:22:18| I believe in Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15738)|
| 4:22:19| Don't let me speak for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15739)|
| 4:22:20| but I think you're saying that you would like to see that the height be six feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15740)|
| 4:22:25| and the size of the sign 36 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15745)|
| 4:22:27| In other words, have the same exception for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15747)|
| 4:22:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15751)|
| 4:22:32| To keep our scenic highway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15752)|
| 4:22:35| Yes, six-foot monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15755)|
| 4:22:38| Well, it says monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15758)|
| 4:22:40| The office district says monument or column sign, so that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15760)|
| 4:22:47| What highways are scenic highways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15767)|
| 4:22:49| What are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15769)|
| 4:22:50| Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15770)|
| 4:22:51| Middlebrook is the only one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15771)|
| 4:22:53| Pike, Lyons View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15773)|
| 4:22:54| There's quite a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15774)|
| 4:22:57| We provided, well, we have on our website, if you enter our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15777)|
| 4:23:01| there is a list of all the scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15781)|
| 4:23:04| And I don't have, I don't think, I probably do have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15784)|
| 4:23:09| I mean, I can find it if you want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15789)|
| 4:23:12| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15792)|
| 4:23:13| Yes, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15793)|
| 4:23:15| Middlebrook Pike is the scenic highway only from Weisgarber West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15795)|
| 4:23:22| From Weisgarber East, it is not a designated scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15802)|
| 4:23:29| Well, as I recall, Jerry, you may know, part of that designation was removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15809)|
| 4:23:34| but I understand they were willing to have it reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15814)|
| 4:23:40| And the part east of Weisgarber has never been designated a scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15820)|
| 4:23:46| and the part west of Weisgarber, with the section that was removed for Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15826)|
| 4:23:51| I think has now been redesignated, if the governor signs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15831)|
| 4:23:58| And I believe that also has been extended even farther west than previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15838)|
| 4:24:09| What's wrong with a 10-foot sign, I guess, is what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15849)|
| 4:24:17| Well, let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15857)|
| 4:24:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15859)|
| 4:24:20| Yeah, Mike Campbell again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15860)|
| 4:24:21| And I agree exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15861)|
| 4:24:22| What's wrong with 10 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15862)|
| 4:24:23| At the end of the day, it goes back to your argument of traffic, speed, width of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15863)|
| 4:24:29| because some of these scenic highways, candidly, are five lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15869)|
| 4:24:32| They're two each direction and turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15872)|
| 4:24:34| So 10 feet is not unreasonable at all for a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15874)|
| 4:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15878)|
| 4:24:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15879)|
| 4:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15882)|
| 4:24:43| There was discussion but no motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15883)|
| 4:24:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15885)|
| 4:24:47| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15887)|
| 4:24:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15888)|
| 4:24:49| So is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15889)|
| 4:24:50| If not, we're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15890)|
| 4:24:51| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15891)|
| 4:24:56| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15896)|
| 4:24:57| Ask that question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15897)|
| 4:24:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15898)|
| 4:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15899)|
| 4:25:00| I believe it was on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15900)|
| 4:25:01| Oh, you're leaving it at 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15901)|
| 4:25:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15902)|
| 4:25:03| Are we leaving it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15903)|
| 4:25:04| Is anyone changing it from the 10 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15904)|
| 4:25:07| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15907)|
| 4:25:08| What was the height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15908)|
| 4:25:09| 6 feet and 36 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15909)|
| 4:25:13| Again, we're on the 11-6-E-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15913)|
| 4:25:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15921)|
| 4:25:22| Mayor, I have the list of the scenic highways, if you'd like to know where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15922)|
| 4:25:26| Yeah, let's hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15926)|
| 4:25:28| Well, I don't, but if council does, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15928)|
| 4:25:31| Do you want to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15931)|
| 4:25:33| Kingston Pike from Concord Street to Naland Drive to Lions View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15933)|
| 4:25:36| Lions View Drive from Kingston Pike to North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15936)|
| 4:25:39| Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15939)|

| 4:25:44| Middlebrook Road from Whitehall Road westward to city boundary except for any segment fronting on land that is on C3 or I3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15944)|
| 4:25:52| Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15952)|
| 4:25:53| Governor John Sevier Highway from Alcoa Highway to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15953)|
| 4:25:57| North Shore Drive from Lions View Road westward to the city boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15957)|
| 4:26:01| Westland Drive from North Shore Drive westward to the city boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15961)|
| 4:26:05| Alcoa Highway from Kingston Pike southward to the city boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15965)|
| 4:26:09| Those are our scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15969)|
| 4:26:12| Are you saying that the 10-foot pole sign is what is in there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15972)|
| 4:26:18| Because I thought that was taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15978)|
| 4:26:23| I mean, I know it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15983)|
| 4:26:24| In office, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15984)|
| 4:26:26| No, I'm talking about on scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15986)|
| 4:26:30| It says a detached sign, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15990)|
| 4:26:33| The maximum sign height for a primary detached sign shall be 10 feet and the maximum sign area shall be 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=15993)|
| 4:26:40| So we're back to the definition of what's a detached sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16000)|
| 4:26:42| And so what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16002)|
| 4:26:43| That's what's currently in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16003)|
| 4:26:45| And so my motion is to make the height 6 feet and the sign 36 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16005)|
| 4:26:50| In other words, corresponded to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16010)|
| 4:26:57| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16017)|
| 4:26:58| That's a motion. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16018)|
| 4:26:59| Did that disclude the pole sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16019)|
| 4:27:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16022)|
| 4:27:03| Yeah, you can't do a pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16023)|
| 4:27:05| I think as it's written here, E2, just as primary detached sign, would include a pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16025)|
| 4:27:11| So if you do want to make it the same as office sign, I think we need to specify monument or column only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16031)|
| 4:27:16| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16036)|
| 4:27:17| That'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16037)|
| 4:27:19| We don't want a pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16039)|
| 4:27:20| 6 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16040)|
| 4:27:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16041)|
| 4:27:22| It's a pretty short pole, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16042)|
| 4:27:24| 6 feet and then 36 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16044)|
| 4:27:27| We have a motion and a second on that. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16047)|
| 4:27:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16049)|
| 4:27:30| We're reducing it from 10 to 6 on a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16050)|
| 4:27:34| Could you repeat that motion, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16054)|
| 4:27:36| That was my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16056)|
| 4:27:38| Please repeat it, Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16058)|
| 4:27:41| My motion is, on parcels and lots adjacent to any street or roads that are part of the state of Tennessee scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16061)|
| 4:27:47| the maximum sign height for a primary detached monument sign...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16067)|
| 4:27:53| Or column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16073)|
| 4:27:54| ...monument or column sign shall be 6 feet and the maximum sign area shall be 36 square feet on the scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16074)|
| 4:28:05| And it's four lanes wide and you're going 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16085)|
| 4:28:08| You're all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16088)|
| 4:28:10| Vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16090)|
| 4:28:13| That is the motion. Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16093)|
| 4:28:15| Yes, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16095)|
| 4:28:16| You did second, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16096)|
| 4:28:18| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16098)|
| 4:28:20| Is this yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16100)|
| 4:28:21| Roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16101)|
| 4:28:23| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16103)|
| 4:28:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16104)|
| 4:28:25| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16105)|
| 4:28:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16106)|
| 4:28:27| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16107)|
| 4:28:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16108)|
| 4:28:29| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16109)|
| 4:28:31| Reluctantly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16111)|
| 4:28:33| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16113)|
| 4:28:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16114)|
| 4:28:35| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16115)|
| 4:28:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16116)|
| 4:28:37| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16117)|
| 4:28:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16118)|
| 4:28:39| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16119)|
| 4:28:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16120)|
| 4:28:41| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16121)|
| 4:28:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16122)|
| 4:28:43| That passes 7 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16123)|
| 4:28:45| Okay, now 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16125)|
| 4:28:48| Anything else on Section 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16128)|
| 4:28:54| Yes, with regard to the scenic highway stuff that you just dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16134)|
| 4:28:59| it talks about on parcels or lots adjacent to any street or road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16139)|
| 4:29:07| I read that to mean abutting the designated scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16147)|
| 4:29:15| In my recollection, the Scenic Highway Act would control sign heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16155)|
| 4:29:20| within 1,000 feet of a scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16160)|
| 4:29:26| and I don't know if it's your intent to only control the sign height of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16166)|
| 4:29:31| immediately adjacent to the road, then I believe you've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16171)|
| 4:29:35| If the intent is to control the sign height within the area that would be impacted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16175)|
| 4:29:41| or protected by the Scenic Highway Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16181)|
| 4:29:44| because you may have a parcel of property that is one lot removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16184)|
| 4:29:49| doesn't actually front on the road, but be one lot removed from the scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16189)|
| 4:29:55| and at this point they would either be permitted a 30 or 40 foot high sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16195)|
| 4:30:00| It's regulated under the Scenic Highway Act regardless of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16200)|
| 4:30:04| We're talking only about peripheral roads that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16204)|
| 4:30:07| The Scenic Highway Act will permit signs I believe as high as 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16207)|
| 4:30:12| You are passing a standard that is less than what is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16212)|
| 4:30:18| Can we even regulate what the state has already said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16218)|
| 4:30:22| You can be more restrictive, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16222)|
| 4:30:24| You can be more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16224)|
| 4:30:25| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16225)|
| 4:30:27| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16227)|
| 4:30:28| But your point is that the Scenic Highway Act covers more than what we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16228)|
| 4:30:34| the parcels adjacent to any street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16234)|
| 4:30:36| It opens up a larger area for regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16236)|
| 4:30:41| If that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16241)|
| 4:30:43| But we're lowering signs away from the scenic highway on the side streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16243)|
| 4:30:47| beyond that 1,000 foot margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16247)|
| 4:30:49| You have done that by previous action, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16249)|
| 4:30:54| But you haven't done that by this particular amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16254)|
| 4:30:59| Sorry I brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16259)|
| 4:31:00| Parsons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16260)|
| 4:31:02| Well, that's something MPC can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16262)|
| 4:31:04| If I can just clarify, because we discussed this extensively in the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16264)|
| 4:31:08| and Melissa McAdams, the city has, unintentionally I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16268)|
| 4:31:14| misinterpreted the scenic highway law as it applies to signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16274)|
| 4:31:20| and Melissa McAdams went back to the state law and ferreted out the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16280)|
| 4:31:25| The state law limits buildings to 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16285)|
| 4:31:32| and the city at some point interpreted that to mean structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16292)|
| 4:31:37| and so the city believed that you could allow up to 35 foot signs on scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16297)|
| 4:31:46| The fact of the matter is that the state allows local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16306)|
| 4:31:51| to regulate signage on scenic highways any way they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16311)|
| 4:31:56| So you can have no signs, you can have a 50 foot sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16316)|
| 4:32:00| it's just up to local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16320)|
| 4:32:04| So what you all, I hope, have decided is to put six foot monument signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16324)|
| 4:32:09| on scenic highways within the city limits, and that's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16329)|
| 4:32:14| I'm still troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16334)|
| 4:32:15| If I'm driving past the hospital with my heart attack in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16335)|
| 4:32:20| can I see it from a six foot sign as opposed to a ten foot sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16340)|
| 4:32:23| I'm worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16343)|
| 4:32:31| I'd like to call on Mr. Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16351)|
| 4:32:33| Mr. Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16353)|
| 4:32:35| Just for clarification, you may want to address the issue of how many of the scenic highways are arterials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16355)|
| 4:32:42| major collectors, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16362)|
| 4:32:52| Councilman Grave, is your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16372)|
| 4:32:56| Move that we pass out flagellation whips and start feeding ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16376)|
| 4:33:02| Okay, so right now there is no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16382)|
| 4:33:07| So is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16387)|
| 4:33:09| I didn't hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16389)|
| 4:33:10| What are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16390)|
| 4:33:13| I thought we were going to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16393)|
| 4:33:15| I'll make a motion that we recess for a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16395)|
| 4:33:21| We will be right back, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16401)|
| 4:33:31| At some point, can I just make a general statement that won't be controversial about residential regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16411)|
| 4:33:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16416)|
| 4:33:45| Why don't you just text it to everybody or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16425)|
| 4:33:48| Did you understand that, Carlene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16428)|
| 4:33:51| You've had all your victory tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16431)|
| 4:33:53| You've won everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16433)|
| 4:33:54| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16434)|
| 4:33:55| I understand my friend, Councilman, Vice Mayor Pavley said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16435)|
| 4:33:59| Yes, I did understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16439)|
| 4:34:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16442)|
| 4:34:04| Mayor, as a point of process, I mean, and if council agrees with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16444)|
| 4:34:09| I mean, we certainly want to hear from what's turned into, I guess, both sides of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16449)|
| 4:34:16| But, I mean, it's 10.39, and, you know, I would like to suggest that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16456)|
| 4:34:23| if there's an issue, say, 12.2a, that if somebody wants to talk from each side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16463)|
| 4:34:28| that we limit it to one person on each side, give it your best shot, and kind of cut off the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16468)|
| 4:34:34| It's kind of gotten into a floor debate, and that's generally not the way that we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16474)|
| 4:34:40| And if it pleases the council and the audience as well to move this along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16480)|
| 4:34:45| I would like to suggest that we use that process moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16485)|
| 4:34:50| I endorse that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16490)|
| 4:34:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16491)|
| 4:34:52| If there's no objection, that's what we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16492)|
| 4:34:55| Yeah, that's kind of what we had started doing, but I think we started that way, and then it kind of lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16495)|
| 4:35:01| I'll take responsibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16501)|
| 4:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16504)|
| 4:35:05| So Section 12, sign construction and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16505)|
| 4:35:11| Any issues there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16511)|
| 4:35:13| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16513)|
| 4:35:15| Chris, anything that needs to be noted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16515)|
| 4:35:17| I think the only thing that I see is 12.2b.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16517)|
| 4:35:22| It talks about rust and other decay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16522)|
| 4:35:26| Sign maintenance, structure maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16526)|
| 4:35:29| Yeah, the structure maintenance as opposed to the surface maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16529)|
| 4:35:32| And I don't know whether everything is steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16532)|
| 4:35:34| It acts like everything is steel, but could it be, I don't know, rusting, splintering, and other decay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16534)|
| 4:35:41| but maybe it's just covered by other decay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16541)|
| 4:35:44| In the other section under surface damage, you talk about peeling, flaking, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16544)|
| 4:35:50| Do you need any more language there, is my question, on what a failure mode might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16550)|
| 4:35:57| But you're just painting it, basically, so maybe that's all you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16557)|
| 4:36:02| We reviewed this with the Plans Review Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16562)|
| 4:36:04| I think we feel comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16564)|
| 4:36:06| Okay, those are the guys that reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16566)|
| 4:36:08| That's fine with me then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16568)|
| 4:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16569)|
| 4:36:10| Okay, anything else on Section 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16570)|
| 4:36:12| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16572)|
| 4:36:13| Let's move to Section 13, abandoned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16573)|
| 4:36:16| Madam Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16576)|
| 4:36:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16578)|
| 4:36:19| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16579)|
| 4:36:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16580)|
| 4:36:21| I've passed out a proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16581)|
| 4:36:25| I don't know if they can put it on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16585)|
| 4:36:30| It looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16590)|
| 4:36:31| It says, Proposed Amendment for Abandoned Signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16591)|
| 4:36:34| What this amendment does is it breaks it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16594)|
| 4:36:39| Abandoned signs, basically, in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16599)|
| 4:36:43| There's one for conforming signs, and then there's one for non-conforming signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16603)|
| 4:36:48| And the one for conforming signs is basically the one that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16608)|
| 4:36:53| It's basically they have 120 days and then 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16613)|
| 4:36:58| and then after that they would have to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16618)|
| 4:37:02| For non-conforming signs, it shortens that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16622)|
| 4:37:08| It's 60 days and then four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16628)|
| 4:37:10| And the reason why I propose this is the basic reason why we're doing all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16630)|
| 4:37:16| is to declutter our streets and try to get our streets looking better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16636)|
| 4:37:22| Obviously, the non-conforming signs are going to be a problem of getting our streets how we want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16642)|
| 4:37:28| I think this gives us a tool to remove the signs that don't conform to this new ordinance that we're passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16648)|
| 4:37:39| So it's a way to speed up the process to make the roads look like the ordinance we're passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16659)|
| 4:37:45| because we all know that the signs are going to be grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16665)|
| 4:37:49| That's the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16669)|
| 4:37:55| Basically, if it's a conforming sign, they get 120 days, and then after that they have 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16675)|
| 4:38:05| So it's a much longer timetable before it's declared abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16685)|
| 4:38:09| For a non-conforming sign, they have 60 days, and then there's all those things they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16689)|
| 4:38:16| And if they don't do any of those, then they're only allowed to another additional four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16696)|
| 4:38:21| So it's the same language in both parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16701)|
| 4:38:23| It's just a much shorter timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16703)|
| 4:38:26| And the effort is to try to, you know, if there's, I think everybody agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16706)|
| 4:38:31| everybody in this room has agreed that 50 feet is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16711)|
| 4:38:35| So if there's a 50-foot sign out there and, you know, it's abandoned, it would be a non-conforming sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16715)|
| 4:38:42| and it would speed up the process and potentially, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16722)|
| 4:38:46| remove that sign more quickly under this type of process rather than just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16726)|
| 4:38:53| So that's the point of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16733)|
| 4:38:55| I've also, if this passes, I've also got definitions for non-conforming sign and conforming sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16735)|
| 4:39:03| but I didn't think we needed to pass those if the amendment's not going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16743)|
| 4:39:07| But I think it makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16747)|
| 4:39:09| 50 feet is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16749)|
| 4:39:12| We've adopted 30 feet for most places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16752)|
| 4:39:16| This will help really get those big, tall, ugly signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16756)|
| 4:39:20| which everyone seems to agree are not what we want in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16760)|
| 4:39:25| and I think this helps us get rid of them sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16765)|
| 4:39:31| So what is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16771)|
| 4:39:34| It's the motion to adopt this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16774)|
| 4:39:37| I'm not going to read the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16777)|
| 4:39:38| 13.1 and 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16778)|
| 4:39:39| Does everybody have their copy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16779)|
| 4:39:42| Here's more copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16782)|
| 4:39:44| And the language is identical except for a conforming one has a different time frame than a non-conforming one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16784)|
| 4:39:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16790)|
| 4:39:51| A conforming one, so a conforming sign would conform with the ordinance after, you know, after we adopt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16791)|
| 4:40:01| then they get a much longer time to deal with the fact that it's abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16801)|
| 4:40:07| The non-conforming sign has a much tighter timetable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16807)|
| 4:40:11| and the reason to do this is to try to remove the non-conforming signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16811)|
| 4:40:16| because this body, this community feels that whatever the numbers reach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16816)|
| 4:40:21| 30 feet, 40 feet, 20 feet, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16821)|
| 4:40:24| that that's what we want for our streets and the other ones are too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16824)|
| 4:40:30| So your motion is incorporating both of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16830)|
| 4:40:33| Yes, to strike 13.1 and replace it with this 13.1 and 13.1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16833)|
| 4:40:41| Why don't you shorten 13.1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16841)|
| 4:40:45| Because those are signs that are conforming and like to give property owners the time to hopefully, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16845)|
| 4:40:54| those are signs that we think are appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16854)|
| 4:40:57| and I think the owners should be given time to find new tenants and should be able to use those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16857)|
| 4:41:04| The signs that are non-conforming, those are signs we all agree we don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16864)|
| 4:41:08| So ideally we can try to get rid of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16868)|
| 4:41:11| And one way, one tool to do that, because of the grandfather issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16871)|
| 4:41:14| is to designate them abandoned in a more timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16874)|
| 4:41:22| Does the 120 days, this was one thing that we want to just clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16882)|
| 4:41:25| the 120 days is included in the 18 months, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16885)|
| 4:41:32| It's an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16892)|
| 4:41:33| It's an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16893)|
| 4:41:34| So it's 120 days plus 18 months in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16894)|
| 4:41:36| So we're giving them 22 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16896)|
| 4:41:38| For conforming signs and six months for non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16898)|
| 4:41:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16903)|
| 4:41:44| So what do you say on the non-conforming signs at the end of six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16904)|
| 4:41:49| You're saying they have to take it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16909)|
| 4:41:51| The sign shall be presumed abandoned and shall be taken down and removed as provided here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16911)|
| 4:41:54| Even if they change the faces out to a blank face or put a sock on it, as you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16914)|
| 4:42:01| Well, that would give them the extra four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16921)|
| 4:42:08| I think 18 months is too long and I think four months is too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16928)|
| 4:42:11| So, I mean, you've got to give a reasonable period of time for the release of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16931)|
| 4:42:17| I mean, I know what your intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16937)|
| 4:42:19| Well, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16939)|
| 4:42:21| The intent is to try to get the sign down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16941)|
| 4:42:23| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16943)|
| 4:42:24| So, I mean, if that's obviously you could make it five years and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16944)|
| 4:42:32| if your goal is to accommodate the tall grandfathered sign, that's what you'd do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16952)|
| 4:42:36| But that's the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16956)|
| 4:42:39| I'm happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16959)|
| 4:42:41| I'm happy to vote on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16961)|
| 4:42:43| George, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16963)|
| 4:42:44| Mr. Ooten, would you like to call on him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16964)|
| 4:42:46| Why don't we hear from the industry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16966)|
| 4:42:48| I think we could get a better feel for what we're pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16968)|
| 4:42:52| Could I ask one quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16972)|
| 4:42:54| 120 days from what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16974)|
| 4:42:55| Do you get a notice or something from the sign inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16975)|
| 4:42:58| How do you know when the clock starts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16978)|
| 4:43:01| I mean, I don't see it in there, but maybe it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16981)|
| 4:43:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16988)|
| 4:43:09| I mean, it's from somebody's notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16989)|
| 4:43:12| 120 days from notice by the sign inspector or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16992)|
| 4:43:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16995)|
| 4:43:17| Let's hear from the industry on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16997)|
| 4:43:19| I think that will help clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=16999)|
| 4:43:20| Mr. Ooten, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17000)|
| 4:43:21| Chris Ooten, again, with the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17001)|
| 4:43:23| Make it good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17003)|
| 4:43:25| You got one shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17005)|
| 4:43:26| And Weigel Stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17006)|
| 4:43:28| I might drag George in on this one to help, as he did with the realtor group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17008)|
| 4:43:37| We talked a lot about this specific issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17017)|
| 4:43:42| We felt that maintenance of signs were very key to all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17022)|
| 4:43:48| If you're not maintaining your sign, we would understand that the time frame could be shortened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17028)|
| 4:43:53| If you're maintaining your sign, the value of that grandfathered sign is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17033)|
| 4:44:02| The business community has offered up some compromise to get these heights lowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17042)|
| 4:44:06| and square footage has changed and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17046)|
| 4:44:09| So it just makes these signs more valuable to the current property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17049)|
| 4:44:15| In my world and George's world and the real estate world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17055)|
| 4:44:19| you're really lucky to have a contract that might happen in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17059)|
| 4:44:27| You're really darn lucky if you get the first person that you've gone after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17067)|
| 4:44:32| I would respectfully submit to Mr. Steyer that that's a little bit too lenient or too short of a time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17072)|
| 4:44:39| As George stated, we don't think that as long as you maintain your signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17079)|
| 4:44:45| the values of those signs ought to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17085)|
| 4:44:47| It could be a 31-foot sign, not a 50-foot sign, as he suggested, and it would fall in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17087)|
| 4:44:55| So if you make it a year instead of 18 months, if it's that case, that might be something that we can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17095)|
| 4:45:04| But there's no difference in the values of those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17104)|
| 4:45:07| We would echo the comments about the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17107)|
| 4:45:12| We agree with that wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17112)|
| 4:45:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17114)|
| 4:45:19| The value is to the city that has to live with a blighted sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17119)|
| 4:45:22| But anyway, these lengths of time are not really representative of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17122)|
| 4:45:30| It's not like a sign gets abandoned on a Monday and it gets determined to be abandoned on a Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17130)|
| 4:45:35| What happens is they sit usually for months and months, sometimes a year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17135)|
| 4:45:40| and somebody says, you know, I think that sign's abandoned, and they call the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17140)|
| 4:45:44| and the city says, okay, well, we'll go out there and we'll inspect and we'll make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17144)|
| 4:45:49| So they get out there in a few weeks or a month, and then they make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17149)|
| 4:45:53| In the meantime, that sign has actually technically been abandoned for several months or a year or even two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17153)|
| 4:46:01| So these time frames are you have to add that on when you conceptualize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17161)|
| 4:46:08| I support, we support this amendment that Councilman Starr has raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17168)|
| 4:46:14| The 120 days and the 18 months, that's longer than any other ordinance I've looked at, and I've looked at many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17174)|
| 4:46:22| Those are really liberal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17182)|
| 4:46:25| And if you're serious about getting rid of sign clutter and expediting improvements in the appearance of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17185)|
| 4:46:36| this is a really good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17196)|
| 4:46:38| I mean, be liberal, if you want, with the conforming signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17198)|
| 4:46:43| but let's get those nonconforming signs taken down and taken down faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17203)|
| 4:46:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17208)|
| 4:46:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17209)|
| 4:46:51| Councilman Gallibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17211)|
| 4:46:52| I just, again, I suggest that we ought to have some date that becomes a formal trigger for when you have to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17212)|
| 4:47:01| Otherwise, we'll spend all of our time in court fighting when it was abandoned or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17221)|
| 4:47:06| So I don't know if there's something we can put in there that 120 days from notice for the sign inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17226)|
| 4:47:11| that it has been found to be abandoned out of X date or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17231)|
| 4:47:15| Just something that gives a clock that you can measure from would save a lot of fighting over nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17235)|
| 4:47:22| And everyone would know when the end of the 120 days is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17242)|
| 4:47:26| and when the end of four months, six months, or 18 months, whatever the heck it is, is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17246)|
| 4:47:31| I'd like to see some determination of the date of abandonment so that you know how to do, you know, when you do what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17251)|
| 4:47:43| May I add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17263)|
| 4:47:45| Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17265)|
| 4:47:46| 13.2 talks about notification to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17266)|
| 4:47:51| So right now we're talking about 13.1 only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17271)|
| 4:47:54| If you look at 13.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17274)|
| 4:47:55| So you looked ahead, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17275)|
| 4:47:56| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17276)|
| 4:47:59| And so that provides that basically the way that this process works is the use is abandoned, and that's the trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17279)|
| 4:48:10| From 120 days after that period, the building official gives notification to the property owner that their sign has been deemed abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17290)|
| 4:48:18| Then they have 30 days, and this is in 13.2, to take action, whether that action is inaction, not doing anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17298)|
| 4:48:28| or that that action is doing one of those A, B, or C items that provides them the additional time for which they can have their abandoned sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17308)|
| 4:48:39| So the outside date is measured from when you get the written notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17319)|
| 4:48:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17322)|
| 4:48:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17323)|
| 4:48:46| It might be abandoned for a period of time before that, but then you get the notice and you've got 30 days to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17326)|
| 4:48:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17332)|
| 4:48:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17333)|
| 4:48:54| I made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17334)|
| 4:48:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17335)|
| 4:48:56| So there's a motion, but no seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17336)|
| 4:49:00| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17340)|
| 4:49:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17342)|
| 4:49:03| And we've addressed Councilman Della's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17343)|
| 4:49:06| Except we didn't hear whether George thought four months was too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17346)|
| 4:49:09| Do you have a better date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17349)|
| 4:49:12| I think if you maintain it, and you maintain it, and you do what you're supposed to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17352)|
| 4:49:18| and keep it painted and put the sock on it and change out the cabinet face and all that, I think four months is too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17358)|
| 4:49:26| You're going to hear arguments that people have said you're chasing them on a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17366)|
| 4:49:33| I just think it's not enough time to lease a property, I can tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17373)|
| 4:49:37| That's no time at all to find a new tenant or sell it and allow the new tenant to put up a new sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17377)|
| 4:49:45| So, I mean, it's, I think 18 months plus four months is probably, that could be trimmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17385)|
| 4:49:51| But I think you need to, I think, I don't know, I'd say nine months on the, you know, if they're keeping it in condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17391)|
| 4:50:00| If it's truly abandoned and they're not doing the maintenance to it and they're leaving it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17400)|
| 4:50:05| and the thing's flapping in the wind, that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17405)|
| 4:50:09| But if they're maintaining it, I think four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17409)|
| 4:50:11| I'd be more comfortable with nine months plus 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17411)|
| 4:50:20| Is that a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17420)|
| 4:50:22| Is that an amendment to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17422)|
| 4:50:25| I'll make that amendment to the amendment that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17425)|
| 4:50:33| I'll make the amendment on stairs 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17433)|
| 4:50:36| It's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17436)|
| 4:50:38| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17438)|
| 4:50:39| You want to accept a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17439)|
| 4:50:41| No, I mean, no, I mean, I'll probably vote against it, but I like four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17441)|
| 4:50:46| I mean, if the goal is to get them down, my goal is to get the non-conforming signs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17446)|
| 4:50:53| This is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17453)|
| 4:50:54| This will be a substitute motion then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17454)|
| 4:50:56| Is that what you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17456)|
| 4:50:58| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17458)|
| 4:50:59| I'll make the substitute motion under his 13A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17459)|
| 4:51:03| I'll make that, I want to say nine months instead of four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17463)|
| 4:51:07| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17467)|
| 4:51:10| But we're only doing 13.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17470)|
| 4:51:11| You're not talking about the 18 months you thought was too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17471)|
| 4:51:16| Cindy, do you want to, Ms. Mitchell, do you want to clarify what you think needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17476)|
| 4:51:21| I mean, what do you, I mean, I think that could be trimmed to 14 months or 15 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17481)|
| 4:51:28| I mean, it's a little bit arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17488)|
| 4:51:34| Mr. Wallace, I think your motion would need to include what Marshall had said about adopting 13.1 as the new 13.1 with that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17494)|
| 4:51:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17506)|
| 4:51:47| 13.1A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17507)|
| 4:51:49| There's 13.1 and 13.1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17509)|
| 4:51:51| This is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17511)|
| 4:51:52| Would it make it easier if we adopted this and then he had his motion to amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17512)|
| 4:51:56| Would that work, make it easier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17516)|
| 4:51:58| Things were simpler before you got here, Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17518)|
| 4:52:03| You know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17523)|
| 4:52:04| Things were simpler before you got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17524)|
| 4:52:08| Don't tell him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17528)|
| 4:52:09| This is the motion on the floor, and he's, you know, which is an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17529)|
| 4:52:15| He's substituting, which means he has to make a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17535)|
| 4:52:17| He's not substituting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17537)|
| 4:52:18| He's amending this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17538)|
| 4:52:19| He can't amend an amendment under Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17539)|
| 4:52:21| I thought you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17541)|
| 4:52:22| I thought you couldn't amend an amendment of an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17542)|
| 4:52:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17544)|
| 4:52:25| I'll offer a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17545)|
| 4:52:26| I'll take, we eliminate what's currently written and substitute it with 13.1 and 13.1A and 13.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17546)|
| 4:52:35| I amend that 18 months, and I make it 14 months, and I amend 13.1A from four months to nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17555)|
| 4:52:46| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17566)|
| 4:52:48| Which will we rule on for Acton first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17568)|
| 4:52:51| So your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17571)|
| 4:52:52| His amendment or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17572)|
| 4:52:53| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17573)|
| 4:52:54| Substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17574)|
| 4:52:57| Don't follow me, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17577)|
| 4:52:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17578)|
| 4:52:59| So we all know what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17579)|
| 4:53:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17582)|
| 4:53:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17584)|
| 4:53:05| George or Marshalls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17585)|
| 4:53:06| Which one are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17586)|
| 4:53:07| I'll vote on George's, which is the one that Marshall had plus, but you've made changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17587)|
| 4:53:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17595)|
| 4:53:16| And those changes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17596)|
| 4:53:18| Those changes are under his 13.1 at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17598)|
| 4:53:22| if any activity on the property is not resumed within a period of 14 months from the abandonment of the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17602)|
| 4:53:30| and on 13.1A, the last sentence, if activity on the property is not resumed within a period of nine months from the abandonment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17610)|
| 4:53:40| Those are the two changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17620)|
| 4:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17622)|
| 4:53:44| And we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17624)|
| 4:53:45| Ben Bar did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17625)|
| 4:53:46| Ben Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17626)|
| 4:53:47| Ben Bar's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17627)|
| 4:53:48| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17628)|
| 4:53:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17629)|
| 4:53:50| I mean, I don't really want to go away from what was presented, but I can smell this one coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17630)|
| 4:53:56| and I would hope that we would trust Councilman Wallace's experience as a long-time realtor in this area here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17636)|
| 4:54:07| and he knows what he's talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17647)|
| 4:54:10| It's not exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17650)|
| 4:54:11| It's a good compromise, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17651)|
| 4:54:13| I mean, again, I'm happy with what was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17653)|
| 4:54:17| That's no secret, but I think that he makes a reasonable request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17657)|
| 4:54:21| and he comes with a lot of years of experience doing this, so I hope we can support him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17661)|
| 4:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17668)|
| 4:54:29| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17669)|
| 4:54:30| Can we hear from the lady from the real estate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17670)|
| 4:54:33| I would just ask that there be some clarification or the wording added for sale or lease signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17673)|
| 4:54:39| It's very unclear what we're able to do or where realtor signs would fall in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17679)|
| 4:54:44| George and I have had some discussion about this, if the property is abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17684)|
| 4:54:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17689)|
| 4:54:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17690)|
| 4:54:53| I think what Ms. Roach is asking is so if the sign that is placed, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17693)|
| 4:55:03| if what is placed over that sign where the use has been abandoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17703)|
| 4:55:07| the principal use that's on the property has been abandoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17707)|
| 4:55:10| is some type of sign that is advertising the availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17710)|
| 4:55:14| So instead of a blank sign face, we now have a sign that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17714)|
| 4:55:18| for lease, 3,200 square foot commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17718)|
| 4:55:23| Are we going to consider that abandoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17723)|
| 4:55:26| And I'm not sure that that's provided for here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17726)|
| 4:55:28| and so that may be an additional item for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17728)|
| 4:55:31| It's maintained and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17731)|
| 4:55:34| Well, the principal use that that sign was associated with, advertising Chili's, for example, has ceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17734)|
| 4:55:42| And so I think under our provisions here, that would be an abandoned sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17742)|
| 4:55:46| and it would have to be taken down after 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17746)|
| 4:55:50| You've got one like that right now on the corner of North Shore and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17750)|
| 4:55:54| Realtors put the sock on it, but it's got the new development that's coming and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17754)|
| 4:56:02| I mean, that's the sock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17762)|
| 4:56:03| I mean, I think it would fall under what you've allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17763)|
| 4:56:06| You maintained it, but it didn't preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17766)|
| 4:56:11| You didn't change the face or the sign or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17771)|
| 4:56:14| You just put the boot on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17774)|
| 4:56:16| I wouldn't think it would modify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17776)|
| 4:56:19| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17779)|
| 4:56:21| I just wanted to point out that many of these signs, as Joyce Feld said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17781)|
| 4:56:26| have been there for years and years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17786)|
| 4:56:30| And if the point is to get rid of these offending signs, some of them like the National Motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17790)|
| 4:56:37| which has been there for, you know, five years that I can think of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17797)|
| 4:56:41| then we really have to act and be a little bit aggressive about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17801)|
| 4:56:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17805)|
| 4:56:47| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17807)|
| 4:56:48| Mike Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17808)|
| 4:56:49| We were trying to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17809)|
| 4:56:50| I thought you all had moved on to 13-2, but since we're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17810)|
| 4:56:54| There are no rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17814)|
| 4:56:56| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17816)|
| 4:56:57| I would submit to you that a sign is part of the real property of a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17817)|
| 4:57:02| It's a real improvement, just as the building is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17822)|
| 4:57:05| And I have a feeling that short of the condemnation process that would need to be followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17825)|
| 4:57:10| this is going to end up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17830)|
| 4:57:12| Just cautioning you with that because I think you're going to have a real, real issue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17832)|
| 4:57:18| And I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17838)|
| 4:57:20| I do suspect I'll be spending the night at the Holiday Inn, but I think you're going to have a big problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17840)|
| 4:57:27| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17847)|
| 4:57:29| We're not just talking about real estate signs here, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17849)|
| 4:57:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17853)|
| 4:57:34| We're talking about different kinds of abandoned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17854)|
| 4:57:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17856)|
| 4:57:37| And a lot of them do need to come down pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17857)|
| 4:57:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17862)|
| 4:57:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17863)|
| 4:57:47| Okay, so we've got George's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17867)|
| 4:57:50| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17870)|
| 4:57:51| Before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17871)|
| 4:57:54| Are you all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17874)|
| 4:57:58| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17878)|
| 4:58:00| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17880)|
| 4:58:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17882)|
| 4:58:03| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17883)|
| 4:58:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17886)|
| 4:58:07| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17887)|
| 4:58:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17890)|
| 4:58:11| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17891)|
| 4:58:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17892)|
| 4:58:13| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17893)|
| 4:58:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17895)|
| 4:58:16| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17896)|
| 4:58:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17897)|
| 4:58:18| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17898)|
| 4:58:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17899)|
| 4:58:20| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17900)|
| 4:58:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17901)|
| 4:58:22| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17902)|
| 4:58:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17903)|
| 4:58:25| That passes six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17905)|
| 4:58:27| Now we get the definitions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17907)|
| 4:58:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17909)|
| 4:58:30| Then I've also, behind that, there's the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17910)|
| 4:58:34| Since we adopted this, I believe we need definitions for non-conforming sign and conforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17914)|
| 4:58:43| The one change I wanted to make to what I've given you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17923)|
| 4:58:47| I don't know if we're able to get it on the screen or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17927)|
| 4:58:50| is to strike the word existing from the definition of conforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17930)|
| 4:58:56| They're short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17936)|
| 4:58:57| Why don't you read them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17937)|
| 4:58:58| I'm going to read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17938)|
| 4:58:59| Non-conforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17939)|
| 4:59:00| Non-conforming sign or sign structure means any existing permanent sign or sign structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17940)|
| 4:59:02| which does not conform to the revisions of this article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17942)|
| 4:59:05| but was lawfully erected and complied with the sign regulations in effect at the time it was erected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17945)|
| 4:59:11| Conforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17951)|
| 4:59:12| Conforming sign or sign structure means any permanent sign or sign structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17952)|
| 4:59:16| which conforms to the revisions of this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17956)|
| 4:59:18| So those two definitions, just so we have it for the 13-1 and 13-A we just adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17958)|
| 4:59:27| Cindy, you crossed out the word existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17967)|
| 4:59:29| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17969)|
| 4:59:31| That goes back to our definition section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17971)|
| 4:59:35| Existing just comes out of the conforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17975)|
| 4:59:39| Existing stays in the non-conforming sign definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17979)|
| 4:59:45| So this just helps us understand what we just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17985)|
| 4:59:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17987)|
| 4:59:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17992)|
| 4:59:53| And we had a motion and a second on that, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17993)|
| 4:59:56| We didn't hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17996)|
| 4:59:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17998)|
| 5:00:02| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18002)|
| 5:00:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18005)|
| 5:00:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18006)|
| 5:00:07| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18007)|
| 5:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18008)|
| 5:00:10| Passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18010)|
| 5:00:19| Are we finished with 13 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18019)|
| 5:00:24| Well, I guess I'm confused on 13-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18024)|
| 5:00:27| If it's not removed at the end of 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18027)|
| 5:00:30| and we just passed something that gave you 120 days for one kind of sign and 60 for another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18030)|
| 5:00:35| how does that work, Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18035)|
| 5:00:38| You get the notice from the building official that it's abandoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18038)|
| 5:00:44| and you've got to do something in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18044)|
| 5:00:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18048)|
| 5:00:49| So in 30 days you have to decide what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18049)|
| 5:00:52| If you're going to do anything, if you're going to put this sock on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18052)|
| 5:00:57| which would give you the now 14 and nine-month kind of additional stall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18057)|
| 5:01:07| and then after that the sign has to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18067)|
| 5:01:10| So there's sort of an additional month of the 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18070)|
| 5:01:14| You get the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18074)|
| 5:01:16| You've got 30 more days, and then you've got the 14 months that we just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18076)|
| 5:01:20| Yes, so long as you take one of those actions provided for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18080)|
| 5:01:22| One of the remedial steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18082)|
| 5:01:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18084)|
| 5:01:26| That's all I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18086)|
| 5:01:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18087)|
| 5:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18088)|
| 5:01:30| Section 14, is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18090)|
| 5:01:33| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18093)|
| 5:01:34| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18094)|
| 5:01:36| This is another sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18096)|
| 5:01:38| It was included that I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18098)|
| 5:01:40| It's non-conforming signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18100)|
| 5:01:44| And what this does is it just sort of in the same vein as the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18104)|
| 5:01:52| It's about changes to non-conforming signs and trying to, as a tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18112)|
| 5:02:00| to try to replace them as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18120)|
| 5:02:03| So if they do things that they would then become illegal signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18123)|
| 5:02:13| What triggers this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18133)|
| 5:02:15| Any type of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18135)|
| 5:02:17| So it reads, the utilization of non-conforming sign and or sign structure may continue subject to the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18137)|
| 5:02:22| and requirements noted below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18142)|
| 5:02:24| When the use of a property changes, including but not limited to the redevelopment of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18144)|
| 5:02:28| or a change in the uses of business, the signs on that property must be brought into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18148)|
| 5:02:33| with the provisions of this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18153)|
| 5:02:35| Section two, with the exception of minor repairs and maintenance and alterations allowed pursuant to state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18155)|
| 5:02:40| no alterations to a non-conforming sign structure shall be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18160)|
| 5:02:44| Unless otherwise allowed by law, any structural or other substantial improvements to a non-conforming sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18164)|
| 5:02:50| except for printing or refurbishing the service of an existing sign or sign structure so as to maintain the appearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18170)|
| 5:02:55| shall be deemed an abandonment of the non-conforming status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18175)|
| 5:02:59| and shall result in the reclassification of such sign as an illegal sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18179)|
| 5:03:03| And I didn't draft this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18183)|
| 5:03:04| I pulled this directly from the Brentwood Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18184)|
| 5:03:10| So it's just another tool to help bring down these non-conforming signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18190)|
| 5:03:19| that seems like everyone agrees that we don't want on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18199)|
| 5:03:23| When you change the use under that subpart one, you've taken yourself out of any grandfather's statute, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18203)|
| 5:03:30| because you have to continue the use under 13-7-208, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18210)|
| 5:03:35| So that's what you're doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18215)|
| 5:03:36| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18216)|
| 5:03:37| And what are you doing in the second part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18217)|
| 5:03:39| You can make repairs and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18219)|
| 5:03:42| They have to be minor, and I don't know what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18222)|
| 5:03:46| No alteration shall be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18226)|
| 5:03:48| How does that fit in with the three things you can do in 13-1 and 2 or 1 and 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18228)|
| 5:03:54| Well, this is not dealing with abandonment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18234)|
| 5:03:56| This is just purely non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18236)|
| 5:03:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18238)|
| 5:03:59| So if you change the use, you're out, and you can make minor repairs and maintenance and alteration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18239)|
| 5:04:06| So state law is probably broader than that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18246)|
| 5:04:10| That's the intent of the amendment I'm proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18250)|
| 5:04:14| I'd make a motion that we add it to Section 14 where it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18254)|
| 5:04:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18261)|
| 5:04:22| Well, if I might, maybe I need to call to my lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18262)|
| 5:04:25| but I thought 13-7-208 says that you can build, rebuild, modify, expand, blah, blah, blah, of course, within the bounds of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18265)|
| 5:04:37| But aren't you allowed to change the sign, and not the use, but the sign, to upgrade it under 13-7-208?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18277)|
| 5:04:47| And so is subpart 2 lawful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18287)|
| 5:04:49| I know he has a caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18289)|
| 5:04:51| Yeah, allowed pursuant to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18291)|
| 5:04:53| It's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18293)|
| 5:04:54| You can make minor repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18294)|
| 5:04:55| You can rebuild the damn thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18295)|
| 5:04:56| You can tear it down and rebuild it under the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18296)|
| 5:05:01| Not Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18301)|
| 5:05:03| Not Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18303)|
| 5:05:05| You can't even build it in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18305)|
| 5:05:07| Farragut was non-conforming and changed the face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18307)|
| 5:05:10| They were like, no, you can't change the face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18310)|
| 5:05:12| You've got to take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18312)|
| 5:05:13| There's these type of clauses in Chattanooga, Sevierville, Brentwood, and these are just the ones that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18313)|
| 5:05:22| These are very common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18322)|
| 5:05:24| Obviously, we're trying to bring down signs, and this is a tool to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18324)|
| 5:05:33| Which means changing the face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18333)|
| 5:05:35| I mean, you change the logo on the deal, and you're just like, no, you can't change the face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18335)|
| 5:05:39| Chris Suiton again with the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18339)|
| 5:05:41| You know, we just went through a process of limiting the number of days that we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18341)|
| 5:05:47| I would sure hate to go even further and talk about uses and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18347)|
| 5:05:52| I mean, I'm going to pick on Mr. DellaVope in Easttown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18352)|
| 5:05:57| He's got buildings back behind Easttown Mall that, you know, have signage on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18357)|
| 5:06:01| or different places where, you know, if a church wanted to buy an old big box or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18361)|
| 5:06:06| presumably now you can't do that because the use has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18366)|
| 5:06:10| The days of the non-conforming and the conforming, we just went through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18370)|
| 5:06:16| I think that's more than enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18376)|
| 5:06:18| Not being able to maintain your sign, getting into the weeds of whether it's legal or not to touch it or rebuild it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18378)|
| 5:06:23| and then further challenging the use, I think that's just too restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18383)|
| 5:06:28| And we're trying to fill buildings, not to understand about the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18388)|
| 5:06:32| and that's what we're here to talk about, but we're also trying to fill buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18392)|
| 5:06:35| and get tax dollars to come in with old buildings, and it just makes it too difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18395)|
| 5:06:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18400)|
| 5:06:42| Ms. Fowle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18402)|
| 5:06:43| I think this is a very important amendment, and we support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18403)|
| 5:06:46| And, again, we're trying to improve the appearance of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18406)|
| 5:06:50| I think this is based on strong case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18410)|
| 5:06:52| Many ordinances in the state of Tennessee have similar language, as Councilman Steyer said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18412)|
| 5:06:59| If you, and I know I've sent this to some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18419)|
| 5:07:02| if you look at Chancellor Fantzler's ruling that came out in October of 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18422)|
| 5:07:10| Lamar Advertising versus the City of Knoxville, he's very clear in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18430)|
| 5:07:17| and mentions in several sections that governments have the right to regulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18437)|
| 5:07:24| make their own rules and regulations concerning legal, non-conforming signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18444)|
| 5:07:31| So I think this is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18451)|
| 5:07:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18454)|
| 5:07:35| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18455)|
| 5:07:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18456)|
| 5:07:37| Two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18457)|
| 5:07:38| First, to partially address Chancellor Fantzler's ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18458)|
| 5:07:41| That was a trial court decision, and the Law Department can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18461)|
| 5:07:46| but that is presently on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18466)|
| 5:07:48| I would never advise a client to rely on a trial court opinion that is presently on appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18468)|
| 5:07:57| because that's a great way to potentially get what you don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18477)|
| 5:08:03| Second, the Brentwood ordinance that Councilman Steyer has brought forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18483)|
| 5:08:14| Ms. Kucurow and I yesterday, we've met extensively on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18494)|
| 5:08:18| and we spoke with the Brentwood official who enforces this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18498)|
| 5:08:25| And they have not been challenged on this in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18505)|
| 5:08:31| So the best answer we can give you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18511)|
| 5:08:35| as she indicated in her memo that Mrs. Mitchell was kind enough to send out this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18515)|
| 5:08:42| is that it's a maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18522)|
| 5:08:44| You can pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18524)|
| 5:08:46| You cannot pass the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18526)|
| 5:08:48| You all are the policymakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18528)|
| 5:08:51| But is it an ironclad that it would be upheld in court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18531)|
| 5:08:57| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18537)|
| 5:08:58| Brentwood doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18538)|
| 5:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18540)|
| 5:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18541)|
| 5:09:02| Mayor, if I could, I don't have any problem with Subpart 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18542)|
| 5:09:05| which is if you change the use, you're outside the protection of that statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18545)|
| 5:09:09| and I think you can regulate it any way you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18549)|
| 5:09:12| With Subsection 2, limits you to minor repairs and maintenance for a nonconforming sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18552)|
| 5:09:20| I don't think you can do that in the face of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18560)|
| 5:09:24| I think the state law is pretty darn clear that as much as I dislike, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18564)|
| 5:09:29| the overprotectionism of that, I think you're asking for trouble on Subsection 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18569)|
| 5:09:36| I realize you've got caveats, unless otherwise allowed by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18576)|
| 5:09:40| but I think you've gone beyond the power that you have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18580)|
| 5:09:45| I guess we can pass it and let someone sever it out if it's challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18585)|
| 5:09:50| I mean, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18590)|
| 5:09:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18592)|
| 5:09:53| So we have a motion, and there's a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18593)|
| 5:09:55| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18595)|
| 5:09:56| And that's Councilman Steyer's amendment, which adds Section 14.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18596)|
| 5:10:03| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18603)|
| 5:10:04| Is Councilwoman Palmer ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18604)|
| 5:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18609)|
| 5:10:10| So let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18610)|
| 5:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18613)|
| 5:10:14| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18614)|
| 5:10:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18615)|
| 5:10:16| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18616)|
| 5:10:18| Yes as to Subsection 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18618)|
| 5:10:20| No, you're voting on the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18620)|
| 5:10:22| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18622)|
| 5:10:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18623)|
| 5:10:25| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18625)|
| 5:10:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18626)|
| 5:10:28| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18628)|
| 5:10:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18629)|
| 5:10:30| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18630)|
| 5:10:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18631)|
| 5:10:32| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18632)|
| 5:10:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18633)|
| 5:10:34| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18634)|
| 5:10:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18635)|
| 5:10:36| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18636)|
| 5:10:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18637)|
| 5:10:41| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18641)|
| 5:10:43| Was it 4-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18643)|
| 5:10:44| 4-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18644)|
| 5:10:47| Want to move for Subpart 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18647)|
| 5:10:50| Well, I'll move to pass Subpart 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18650)|
| 5:10:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18654)|
| 5:10:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18657)|
| 5:10:58| I'll vote yes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18658)|
| 5:10:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18659)|
| 5:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18661)|
| 5:11:02| Is there any discussion so you all know the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18662)|
| 5:11:05| Define use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18665)|
| 5:11:08| Does that mean the same type of business, different name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18668)|
| 5:11:13| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18673)|
| 5:11:14| I think use goes to the actual use of the sign on the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18674)|
| 5:11:19| and I think he has a right to rebuild it or repair it or do all kinds of things to it under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18679)|
| 5:11:26| But if for some reason, and maybe you get close to abandonment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18686)|
| 5:11:30| but if for some reason he's not actively using it as a sign or those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18690)|
| 5:11:35| or he changes the use to be an on-premise sign, for example, it was an off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18695)|
| 5:11:40| You're talking about changing the use of the sign, not the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18700)|
| 5:11:43| Property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18703)|
| 5:11:44| You're talking about use of property, aren't you, Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18704)|
| 5:11:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18706)|
| 5:11:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18707)|
| 5:11:48| That's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18708)|
| 5:11:49| I mean, you have properties out there that have the buildings been torn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18709)|
| 5:11:53| and the sign's still there, and you're changing the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18713)|
| 5:11:57| This is a sign on a now-abandoned site, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18717)|
| 5:11:59| Well, I mean, Wendy's on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18719)|
| 5:12:01| It went from a Wendy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18721)|
| 5:12:02| They tore the Wendy's down, and they put it at a Zaxby's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18722)|
| 5:12:05| Changed the sign face, and they're off and running at a Zaxby's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18725)|
| 5:12:07| You're talking about changing the use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18727)|
| 5:12:09| That didn't change the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18729)|
| 5:12:10| It's still a fast food, still a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18730)|
| 5:12:13| It didn't change the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18733)|
| 5:12:14| You're saying you've got to change the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18734)|
| 5:12:18| Went to a different use, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18738)|
| 5:12:20| So if it goes to a different use, if it goes to medical, now you've changed the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18740)|
| 5:12:26| Not the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18746)|
| 5:12:27| We've moved it away from the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18747)|
| 5:12:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18748)|
| 5:12:29| And the idea is this is a nonconforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18749)|
| 5:12:31| This is a sign that doesn't conform to the law that we want our signage on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18751)|
| 5:12:40| Just like billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18760)|
| 5:12:41| We don't want billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18761)|
| 5:12:44| But they're out there, you know, and there's rules about what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18764)|
| 5:12:48| They're not conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18768)|
| 5:12:53| You're saying if you go from Wendy's to Bojangles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18773)|
| 5:12:55| What is the goal of this whole process is to declutter our streets with these nonconforming signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18775)|
| 5:13:00| Apparently they put a big knot in front of my head where I banged it here on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18780)|
| 5:13:03| I think that's gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18783)|
| 5:13:05| That's the purpose, in my opinion, of why we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18785)|
| 5:13:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18789)|
| 5:13:11| So we want to just leave all the big ugly signs up, and amendments like this aren't important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18791)|
| 5:13:17| But if we want to start bringing them down, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18797)|
| 5:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18802)|
| 5:13:23| And this is Brentwood's approach to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18803)|
| 5:13:25| This is in Brentwood, Chattanooga, places like Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18805)|
| 5:13:28| I mean, this is very, very common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18808)|
| 5:13:31| We're way behind the curve on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18811)|
| 5:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18817)|
| 5:13:38| So the motion is on 14.41, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18818)|
| 5:13:43| Parentheses 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18823)|
| 5:13:44| That's what we're voting on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18824)|
| 5:13:45| And there was a second as well, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18825)|
| 5:13:47| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18827)|
| 5:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18828)|
| 5:13:49| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18829)|
| 5:13:50| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18830)|
| 5:13:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18831)|
| 5:13:52| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18832)|
| 5:13:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18833)|
| 5:13:54| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18834)|
| 5:13:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18835)|
| 5:13:56| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18836)|
| 5:13:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18837)|
| 5:13:58| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18838)|
| 5:13:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18839)|
| 5:14:00| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18840)|
| 5:14:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18841)|
| 5:14:02| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18842)|
| 5:14:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18843)|
| 5:14:04| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18844)|
| 5:14:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18845)|
| 5:14:06| Passes 6-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18846)|
| 5:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18851)|
| 5:14:13| Anything else on Section 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18853)|
| 5:14:18| We're now on Section 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18858)|
| 5:14:20| I'd like to recognize former Councilwoman Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18860)|
| 5:14:26| I think she had a non-controversial statement she wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18866)|
| 5:14:30| Go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18870)|
| 5:14:31| Go to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18871)|
| 5:14:32| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18872)|
| 5:14:33| And it was several sections back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18873)|
| 5:14:39| It was like Section 11 having to do with residential properties and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18879)|
| 5:14:47| And this is kind of a general thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18887)|
| 5:14:50| The words detached and attached have been heavily used and freely used in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18890)|
| 5:14:57| And unfortunately, sometimes you need to be more specific than attached and detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18897)|
| 5:15:03| In fact, the very nicely prepared thing that sets out all the signs and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18903)|
| 5:15:14| the last column over here says wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18914)|
| 5:15:17| And it should actually be attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18917)|
| 5:15:20| Okay, just as you have monument and column and pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18920)|
| 5:15:25| For detached, attached signs aren't just wall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18925)|
| 5:15:30| They can be all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18930)|
| 5:15:32| And this zoning ordinance can be amended and will be amended over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18932)|
| 5:15:37| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18937)|
| 5:15:38| So my request is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18938)|
| 5:15:42| As this goes back to MPC, that we ask MPC in areas where the law department, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18942)|
| 5:15:49| thinks we need specificity as to what kind of attached sign should be in that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18949)|
| 5:15:58| that we ask MPC to put in, select which kind of attached sign should be in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18958)|
| 5:16:04| So in other words, if it should be a wall sign as opposed to a projecting sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18964)|
| 5:16:10| or some other kind of attached sign, let MPC recommend those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18970)|
| 5:16:15| And also, when it comes to multifamily, if we would add back in the language that specifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18975)|
| 5:16:24| that on a building, not a structure, let's change it from structure to building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18984)|
| 5:16:28| that on a building where you're allowed nine square foot of signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18988)|
| 5:16:32| we include, we put back in the language that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18992)|
| 5:16:36| and those nine square foot per building wall signs shall be limited to the address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=18996)|
| 5:16:44| the identification, the management name of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19004)|
| 5:16:48| before we end up with nine square foot signs on apartment buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19008)|
| 5:16:52| or condo buildings or whatever that say, come here and enjoy the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19012)|
| 5:16:56| I don't think that's what we have in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19016)|
| 5:16:58| That's not what we have allowed in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19018)|
| 5:17:00| I think that was inadvertently left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19020)|
| 5:17:03| So those are my non-controversial requests, and thank you so much for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19023)|
| 5:17:07| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19027)|
| 5:17:09| Okay, was there anything on Section 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19029)|
| 5:17:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19031)|
| 5:17:12| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19032)|
| 5:17:13| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19033)|
| 5:17:14| One of the things that the sign task force wrestled with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19034)|
| 5:17:17| and looked into was the increase of sign permit fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19037)|
| 5:17:23| and Peter is here and would just like to verify the fact that we have raised the fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19043)|
| 5:17:31| and how this compares to other municipalities and whether or not it's raised enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19051)|
| 5:17:37| The $75 fee and the $5 extra per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19057)|
| 5:17:45| Peter, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19065)|
| 5:17:46| It's almost good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19066)|
| 5:17:47| Peter Arons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19067)|
| 5:17:48| Yes, almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19068)|
| 5:17:49| Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19069)|
| 5:17:50| Yeah, we provided some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19070)|
| 5:17:53| We can get that to you, but we're really not trying to get ahead of our regional neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19073)|
| 5:17:58| or even state neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19078)|
| 5:18:00| We're just bringing the fees up to be consistent with other jurisdictions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19080)|
| 5:18:07| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19087)|
| 5:18:08| The number is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19088)|
| 5:18:09| The number is $75 plus $5 per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19089)|
| 5:18:14| That's what's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19094)|
| 5:18:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19095)|
| 5:18:16| Right now it's $50 and $3 per thousand, so we increased it nominally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19096)|
| 5:18:24| I thought you were going to add more to this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19104)|
| 5:18:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19106)|
| 5:18:27| How do you know the value of the sign, commercial sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19107)|
| 5:18:32| We rely on the applicant to tell us the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19112)|
| 5:18:37| Sucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19117)|
| 5:18:38| They're all laughing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19118)|
| 5:18:41| I mean, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19121)|
| 5:18:42| That's consistent with how we price all of our permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19122)|
| 5:18:46| All of our building permits are based on a fee schedule that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19126)|
| 5:18:51| If we find something out of whack, we definitely ask the question, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19131)|
| 5:18:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19136)|
| 5:18:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19137)|
| 5:18:58| If we go too low, we can condemn the sign and give them the $10 back or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19138)|
| 5:19:03| Thank you, Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19143)|
| 5:19:04| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19144)|
| 5:19:07| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19147)|
| 5:19:10| It says up there, and I can't read it very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19150)|
| 5:19:12| but it says applications shall be processed within ten working days of receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19152)|
| 5:19:20| Or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19160)|
| 5:19:23| It's automatically approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19163)|
| 5:19:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19166)|
| 5:19:28| Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19168)|
| 5:19:29| No, it wouldn't be automatically approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19169)|
| 5:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19176)|
| 5:19:37| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19177)|
| 5:19:38| Margo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19178)|
| 5:19:39| I feel like I should just go down on a knee and, you know, may I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19179)|
| 5:19:42| I would just suggest that maybe you look at what the insured value is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19182)|
| 5:19:46| because those signs are insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19186)|
| 5:19:48| So if that's a possible way to arrive at the actual value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19188)|
| 5:19:53| the city could make a reasonable amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19193)|
| 5:19:55| and it would not just be based on what the person tells you it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19195)|
| 5:19:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19199)|
| 5:20:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19200)|
| 5:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19204)|
| 5:20:05| So we've just been discussing what's actually in here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19205)|
| 5:20:07| So there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19207)|
| 5:20:09| No change is our call for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19209)|
| 5:20:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19212)|
| 5:20:13| So that is the end, except we now need Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19213)|
| 5:20:18| I think we need a motion to send it on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19218)|
| 5:20:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19220)|
| 5:20:21| We need a motion to send this to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19221)|
| 5:20:24| But I want to say we don't have very many people left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19224)|
| 5:20:27| but I think the Council now kind of has a feeling of what we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19227)|
| 5:20:32| for the last three and a half years to get where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19232)|
| 5:20:35| And, again, I know that we have some people that are content about certain issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19235)|
| 5:20:39| and some that aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19239)|
| 5:20:41| And, again, I think that all of us need to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19241)|
| 5:20:43| and understand that what we were looking for is balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19243)|
| 5:20:47| We're looking forward to the future of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19247)|
| 5:20:50| and I think there are ways in which we can continue to make our city more beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19250)|
| 5:20:56| But, again, I want to thank the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19256)|
| 5:20:59| I want to thank all those folks that stuck it out with us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19259)|
| 5:21:02| and just remind you that there is a public meeting at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19262)|
| 5:21:06| and there will be two more public meetings here at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19266)|
| 5:21:10| So with that, I'd like to make a motion that we move to send what we've done tonight on to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19270)|
| 5:21:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19278)|
| 5:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19281)|
| 5:21:23| And I just want to say that I think you all have made a new record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19283)|
| 5:21:26| for Council meetings in my administration so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19286)|
| 5:21:29| So I'm not going to say thank you, but this was needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19289)|
| 5:21:33| So, okay, we have a motion and a second to send as amended to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19293)|
| 5:21:38| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19298)|
| 5:21:40| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19300)|
| 5:21:41| I'm sorry, Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19301)|
| 5:21:42| I wanted to add something, and I just consulted with Mr. Kelly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19302)|
| 5:21:46| I think it would be helpful for MPC to provide specific instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19306)|
| 5:21:52| on the issues that we identified during our discussion tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19312)|
| 5:21:56| that we wanted more consideration given to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19316)|
| 5:22:01| and kind of perhaps a specific recommendation from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19321)|
| 5:22:05| And I kept a list of that if you all would want to amend the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19325)|
| 5:22:10| However, we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19330)|
| 5:22:13| We did pay special attention to the items that we needed further guidance on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19333)|
| 5:22:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19338)|
| 5:22:19| So we have when to allow the banner type signs in Section 4.22 to go up preceding an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19339)|
| 5:22:29| How do we want to treat street sign banners, and do they need to be exempt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19349)|
| 5:22:36| There seemed to be discussion around window signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19356)|
| 5:22:39| although I don't know if council ultimately wants MPC to weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19359)|
| 5:22:45| Mark just shook his head no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19365)|
| 5:22:47| I think those were exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19367)|
| 5:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19369)|
| 5:22:50| And then Ms. Malone just mentioned several items for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19370)|
| 5:22:56| I don't know whether you all want to specify MPC to consider those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19376)|
| 5:23:00| The residential identifying the sort of unit location contact rather than come have fun here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19380)|
| 5:23:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19387)|
| 5:23:08| And then specificity to the type of attached signs in specific residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19388)|
| 5:23:15| Agreement on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19395)|
| 5:23:17| Well, I mean, I didn't mean to write it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19397)|
| 5:23:20| I mean, if there's something regarding window signs they need to look at, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19400)|
| 5:23:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19405)|
| 5:23:26| That's the list that we'll send with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19406)|
| 5:23:28| Mr. Kelly, is that fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19408)|
| 5:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19410)|
| 5:23:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19411)|
| 5:23:32| So I don't think we're going to need a roll call on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19412)|
| 5:23:35| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19415)|
| 5:23:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19417)|
| 5:23:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19418)|
| 5:23:39| I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19419)|
| 5:23:40| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19420)|
| 5:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19421)|
| 5:23:42| I thought you were joking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19422)|
| 5:23:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19424)|
| 5:23:45| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19425)|
| 5:23:46| It passes seven to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19426)|
| 5:23:50| Seven to zero to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19430)|
| 5:23:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19432)|
| 5:23:57| Adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=19437)|
