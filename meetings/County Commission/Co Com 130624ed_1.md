| 2:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| And that's my motion pending someone bringing something that would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9037)|
| 2:30:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| The developer is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| I think that was the question that was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9047)|
| 2:30:51| Is the developer here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9051)|
| 2:30:56| Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| Knoxville 325 Wooded Lane, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| As we recollected our discussions from 60 days ago, we had talked about finally the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9065)|
| 2:31:11| the owner had authorized us to go to one unit to the acre PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| So when we left the meeting, we were talking one unit to the acre agriculture or one unit to the acre PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| If the community wishes it to stay one unit to the acre agricultural, then that's not unacceptable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| Same number of units we were already expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9085)|
| 2:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| Paul, would you like to come back and state your opinion as to why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| And, Mr. Chairman, before getting his statement, let me ask MPC a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9095)|
| 2:31:44| So what is before us today, your recommendation, if it's denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9104)|
| 2:31:52| then as the applicant has just stated, it's acceptable to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9112)|
| 2:32:00| If what's before us is denied, the outcome is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9120)|
| 2:32:07| That's leave it agricultural, one to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| Actually, in the agricultural zone, it's not exactly the same thing as planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| And he's got 51 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| However he lays that out, it's probably going to be less than one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9141)|
| 2:32:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9146)|
| 2:32:27| Under agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| As I look at this, the request of the adjacent property owners is that it remain agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| And what I just heard from the developer property owner, leaving it agricultural is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9156)|
| 2:32:46| So to effect that, to bring that into effect, it would be our position to deny this request for rezoning that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9166)|
| 2:33:02| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9183)|
| 2:33:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| Paul, just give us your reason for basis of your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9185)|
| 2:33:10| Well, I think the major thing that has happened, we've had a couple of meetings, one with a number of the homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9190)|
| 2:33:22| and we had one with Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9202)|
| 2:33:26| We're very grateful for the opportunity to meet and discuss this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9206)|
| 2:33:32| And what we found out from Mr. Taylor and from Mr. Campbell was that the cost of bringing sewer into this area was going to be prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9212)|
| 2:33:49| With that in mind, the density is probably going to be something like 30 to 35 houses on this 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9229)|
| 2:33:59| And so whether it's planned residential or agriculture is not of particular concern to us at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9239)|
| 2:34:08| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9248)|
| 2:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9249)|
| 2:34:10| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| Yeah, I have a question, really, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| If it's zoned, and this is to be sure to protect the homeowners out there, if it's zoned agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9256)|
| 2:34:25| because it sounds like this road is pretty narrow, and even with 30 or 35 additional homes on there, it could cause some traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9265)|
| 2:34:32| If it's zoned agricultural, does the developer have to come back down with any plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9272)|
| 2:34:38| Does he even have to do anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| Or if you're not changing the zoning, can he go ahead and build as long as it fits the one acre, I mean, one house per acre criterion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9280)|
| 2:34:51| Or if it's zoned planned residential, would there be a stricter criteria that he has to do to meet that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9291)|
| 2:35:03| where maybe the humps in the road have to be taken out, the road has to be higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9303)|
| 2:35:08| So, I mean, does it make a difference how it's zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| If you approve it for one house per acre zoned planned residential versus one house per acre where you're not changing the zoning at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9312)|
| 2:35:25| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| With the property remaining agriculture and the next step in the development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9327)|
| 2:35:33| then would be to enter immediately into the subdivision regulation approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9333)|
| 2:35:40| with the first step being approval of a concept plan by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| the second step being the approval of a design plan by the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9346)|
| 2:35:51| and then lastly, final plats are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9351)|
| 2:35:56| With subdivision regulations, there is much less discretion by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9356)|
| 2:36:03| It's described as a ministerial act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| If an applicant meets all of the requirements of the subregs, the planning commission is compelled to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9365)|
| 2:36:14| With a planned residential zone district with the same yield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| the planning commission has some discretion about lot placement and tree protection and items such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9379)|
| 2:36:28| In both cases, you're probably going to get requirements to improve the condition of Shackleford Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9388)|
| 2:36:37| because it is immediately adjacent to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| In a planned zone district, you might get a requirement to go beyond that and improve Graves Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9399)|
| 2:36:46| which you would not get in a subdivision regulation situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9406)|
| 2:36:53| The other thing, I'm just posing this question maybe to the homeowners as we deliberate on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9413)|
| 2:37:00| If they use part of the property, let's say they put 30 units on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| you're still going to have 20 acres where nothing is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| And if it's zoned agriculture, there's a lot of things that can come in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9428)|
| 2:37:14| They can put in a hog farm, a chicken farm, some other things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9434)|
| 2:37:18| Whereas if this is zoned one unit per acre planned residential, then, you know, that may very well protect things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9438)|
| 2:37:30| I mean, if I'm saying something incorrect, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| But it seems like there's more protection in a planned residential than there would be in agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| And then if we approve one unit per acre planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| it might give you some other protections that you wouldn't have if it's left agricultural and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9463)|
| 2:37:48| they build on it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| I mean, I think that's something that we want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9471)|
| 2:37:54| Thank you, Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| because you point out some of the same things that I've done in the conversations I've had with the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9475)|
| 2:38:03| The one thing that I have not really impressed upon them is my credential in this is I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9483)|
| 2:38:11| And I am not trying to sell one plan over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9491)|
| 2:38:16| What I'm trying to do is to satisfy the request of those other people that live on either Graves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9496)|
| 2:38:26| or Shackleford or in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| And if they wanted to stay agricultural and the property owner is saying agricultural is okay, that's what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9510)|
| 2:38:39| And all we're doing today is just denying this request from MPC and leaving things as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9519)|
| 2:38:47| Now, if the adjacent property owners want to entertain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9527)|
| 2:38:53| and I thought that's what would take place during this two-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| that the developer would offer something other than what we have really before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9536)|
| 2:39:04| What we have before us is a two-to-the-acre planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9544)|
| 2:39:13| That's what we're voting on, yes or no on two-to-the-acre planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9553)|
| 2:39:19| If we vote no, then it stays as both parties facing us say is acceptable to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9559)|
| 2:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9567)|
| 2:39:28| And I'm not advising them one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9568)|
| 2:39:31| I'm asking both parties to come forward with what do they want in a single plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9571)|
| 2:39:38| And I think what we have before us is what they want in a single plan, which is leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9578)|
| 2:39:46| Do you want to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9587)|
| 2:39:48| I mean, if everybody's happy with what they've got, what's for me to change something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9588)|
| 2:39:54| I'm going to have to change my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| Would that be acceptable, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| You want to make a substitute motion on your own motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| I just want to change my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9605)|
| 2:40:08| I have moved that we deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9608)|
| 2:40:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| I need to move that we approve and everyone vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| That's what I just said a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| If I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9621)|
| 2:40:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9627)|
| 2:40:28| You need to deny it because if you make a motion to approve right now, it's two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| And then everyone should vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| Right now I have moved to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| I'll leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9642)|
| 2:40:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9643)|
| 2:40:44| I'll leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9644)|
| 2:40:45| I think we know what you mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| Everyone understand what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9646)|
| 2:40:49| To deny requires an affirmative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9649)|
| 2:40:56| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9656)|
| 2:40:57| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9659)|
| 2:41:00| I'm confused now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9660)|
| 2:41:01| So the motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| To deny, does it revert back to agriculture, which means one unit per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| It doesn't mean one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9672)|
| 2:41:13| It just means that the zoning will stay at agricultural status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9673)|
| 2:41:18| So it could be, like I've said, it could be 30 to 40 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| regardless of how the configuration works out and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9681)|
| 2:41:25| Going through the subdivision process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| Now, MPC, does this come back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9688)|
| 2:41:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9691)|
| 2:41:32| As a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| As a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| So once we approve this and we say, okay, it's back to agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| all the plans and everything comes right back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9700)|
| 2:41:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9701)|
| 2:41:42| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9702)|

| 2:43:33| I would prefer to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9815)|
| 2:43:36| You're going to need a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9816)|

| 2:43:45| I'm torn on this one, but just I need a motion to approve just to get it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9825)|
| 2:43:49| Here's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| Second, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I am Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9834)|
| 2:43:58| I'm here on behalf of Mr. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| The property, if you'll look at the zoning map in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| has been zoned Planned Commercial portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9845)|
| 2:44:11| and the other BP or business park for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9851)|
| 2:44:17| Mr. Garrett has lived on this property for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9857)|
| 2:44:24| He filed an application some time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| We've had six hearings on this matter so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9868)|
| 2:44:32| He filed a rezoning application to have all of the property zoned to OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9872)|
| 2:44:40| And let me mention that this property is covered by the Technology Overlay District also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9880)|
| 2:44:47| We've had four hearings at the Technology Overlay and two at the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9887)|
| 2:44:53| The property was originally zoned, or at least a portion of it, Planned Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9893)|
| 2:44:58| when it was thought that the beltway would be connecting into I-40 and Pellissippi Parkway in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9898)|
| 2:45:06| With the demise of the beltway, that area is probably not best suited for Planned Commercial anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9906)|
| 2:45:16| The reason Mr. Garrett asked for OB is that it allows residential usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9916)|
| 2:45:24| The property in the area has been zoned, some of it across Pellissippi Parkway, for residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9924)|
| 2:45:37| and a number of residences, including apartments, are being constructed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9937)|
| 2:45:44| When we first asked for OB, there was some discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9944)|
| 2:45:49| We went to the Tech Corridor Development Authority, and they approved it unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9949)|
| 2:45:55| When we went to MPC after one hearing and some opposition from Mr. McBride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9955)|
| 2:46:02| who is the only person who's appeared at hearings before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9962)|
| 2:46:06| suggesting that part of the property not be zoned OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9966)|
| 2:46:12| and that would be the property to the south adjacent to Harrison Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9972)|
| 2:46:18| So, after discussions with MPC, we went back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| and MPC recommended that that property be zoned Planned Residential at 8.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9981)|
| 2:46:29| Under the proposal before you, before anything can be developed on this property adjacent to Harrison Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9989)|
| 2:46:38| you would have to have two hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| You would have, one, a use-on-review hearing before the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10000)|
| 2:46:46| You would then have to go to the Technology Corridor Development Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10006)|
| 2:46:51| and they would review your site plan also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| So there are double protections for Harrison Springs in the zoning recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10015)|
| 2:47:01| which comes to you today from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10021)|
| 2:47:08| And I might mention that the technology overlay causes some changes in the underlying zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10028)|
| 2:47:16| For instance, there are 100-foot setbacks from adjoining residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10036)|
| 2:47:23| that would be required under the technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| So Harrison Springs has double protection under the recommendation of the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10046)|
| 2:47:33| which Mr. Garrett is asking you all to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10053)|
| 2:47:37| The present zoning would allow industrial uses on the BP portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10057)|
| 2:47:47| For instance, you can have the manufacturing, compounding, processing, packaging, treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10067)|
| 2:47:55| and fabrication of ceramics, instruments, optical goods, and pharmaceuticals under the existing BP zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10075)|
| 2:48:03| You can have manufacture of miscellaneous electrical parts, including automotive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10083)|
| 2:48:10| Manufacture of motor vehicle parts and accessories, including mechanical, electrical, and electronic parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10090)|
| 2:48:17| Manufacturing of electrical switchgear and switchboard apparatus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10097)|
| 2:48:22| Manufacturing relays and industrial controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| A wide array of industrial uses are allowed under the existing zoning that is adjacent to Harrison Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10105)|
| 2:48:37| What we're asking for is residential zoning adjacent to Harrison Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10117)|
| 2:48:44| which would be up to 8.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| That would be the maximum we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| That would be subject to a site plan submittal to the MPC and to the technology overlay zone, which reviews these also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10133)|
| 2:49:05| So as far as Harrison Springs goes, I am suggesting to you all that the proposed zoning would be far superior to the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10145)|
| 2:49:20| that they're asking actually to stay in place, the BP zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10160)|
| 2:49:24| because it has site plan review only by the Tech Carter Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10164)|
| 2:49:29| There is no MPC site plan review of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10169)|
| 2:49:35| So the recommendation that comes to you from the Metropolitan Planning Commission is the one we would ask you to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10175)|
| 2:49:43| which includes changing the PC portion of the property to OB with the technology overlay, of course, remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10183)|
| 2:49:53| That will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| And the present BP or industrial type zoning to plan residential up to 8.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10195)|
| 2:50:07| I assume Mr. McBride is going to ask again that this property, the zone on it, not be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10207)|
| 2:50:15| If it is not changed, it allows a wide array of manufacturing and office uses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10215)|
| 2:50:25| And so we're asking you all to approve the MPC staff and the MPC commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10225)|
| 2:50:36| I might mention I think the technology overlay board voted unanimously at their four meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10236)|
| 2:50:43| MPC voted at their first meeting to postpone and request that we look at plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10243)|
| 2:50:52| Staff came back with that plan residential at up to 8.5 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10252)|
| 2:50:58| and that carried the Metropolitan Planning Commission by 14 votes to one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10258)|
| 2:51:06| So this plan, the proposal we have before you, which is what MPC staff has recommended, has been looked at, I can assure you, long and hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10266)|
| 2:51:17| It's been going on since the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| We think it is best for the applicant, Mr. Garrett, who lives on the property, and for the neighbors in Harrison Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10280)|
| 2:51:33| Quick question I've got, Arthur, before you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| What will be the access to property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| It will probably – what's the name of that street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| Thompson Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10302)|
| 2:51:43| Iron Gate Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10303)|
| 2:51:44| It will not come off Harrison Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| There will be no access through Harrison Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| I should have mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10309)|
| 2:51:50| Or Schaefer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| Or maybe Thompson Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10312)|
| 2:51:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10315)|
| 2:51:56| He's thinking of Schaefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| Thompson doesn't come into play there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10321)|
| 2:52:02| Hardin Valley to Iron Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10322)|
| 2:52:03| There's going to be a new road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10323)|
| 2:52:04| It will come off Hardin Valley initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10324)|
| 2:52:09| There will be no entrance through the Harrison Springs subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10329)|
| 2:52:13| And one of the conditions I might mention, there are two conditions on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10333)|
| 2:52:18| One, that there be no grading or anything on the property until a site plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10338)|
| 2:52:26| And, second, that Schaefer Road be improved as part of the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10346)|
| 2:52:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10355)|
| 2:52:36| Real quick, opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10356)|
| 2:52:37| Nick, you had something you wanted to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10357)|
| 2:52:40| And, Nick, give you a little extra time if you need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| I appreciate that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| Nick McBride, 2032 Fallhaven Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10364)|
| 2:52:51| I want to acknowledge that some of the adjoining property owners that live in Harrison Springs are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10371)|
| 2:52:58| It has been six or seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| Mr. Seymour, I know we forget some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10380)|
| 2:53:02| I am not the only person that has talked to this TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10382)|
| 2:53:06| I know Ian from my subdivision was there once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| Originally, when this came before the TTCDA this year, it was a motion was made to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10389)|
| 2:53:16| and it sat on the table for about five minutes and nobody had seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| So they finally deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| And it has been a long six to seven months dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10401)|
| 2:53:26| But if you don't mind, I'd like to back you up to 2008, November of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10406)|
| 2:53:33| Mr. Garrett, through Continental 256 Fund, came in front of the TTCDA to do a major what's the zoning, what's above zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10413)|
| 2:53:49| Yeah, came to do a sector plan change and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10429)|
| 2:53:53| Harrison Springs, we didn't find out about it until the 12th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10433)|
| 2:53:57| And so I think in December of 2008, a sector plan was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| We fault what they were trying to do at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10441)|
| 2:54:04| In 2008, Continental Development was looking at putting in apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10444)|
| 2:54:09| They came in and said, we need to put one to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10449)|
| 2:54:15| And that was the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| And it went to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| They saw, I guess, layouts of all the buildings and parking and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10459)|
| 2:54:24| MPC staff said, no, that is not what is in the area, the zoning around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10464)|
| 2:54:32| MPC, at that time, in 2008, said it would be an additional almost 3,000 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| And at that time they said it would be 80 new students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10478)|
| 2:54:42| And so we went for a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| And the purchaser was working with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10485)|
| 2:54:50| And the best that MPC would come up to on what they would allow the density was one to six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10490)|
| 2:55:00| So then we've kind of sat around for four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10500)|
| 2:55:04| Eight or nine lots have sold that have joined this property based on MPC's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10504)|
| 2:55:10| what they were thinking with the traffic count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10510)|
| 2:55:13| At that time, traffic was still coming to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| It wasn't coming off of Schaefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| Still looking at the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10518)|
| 2:55:19| We all know that Hardin Valley High School is very overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10519)|
| 2:55:22| We know that the elementary is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| but I think maybe it's going to lose some to the new elementary school that's opening up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10524)|
| 2:55:28| So that's going to ease the crowding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| But, you know, if they had come in, you know, with the planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10531)|
| 2:55:35| I know Mr. Seymour is going to say, well, you know, we didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| And he testified at TTCDA five and six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10538)|
| 2:55:43| At that time they did not have a purchaser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10543)|
| 2:55:45| And now, apparently, they do have a purchaser who's wanting to put one to 12 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10545)|
| 2:55:50| is what they would be allowed to the north of our the northernmost track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10550)|
| 2:55:55| They'd be allowed to put one to 12 units per acre, which MPC four years ago said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10555)|
| 2:56:00| And they would be allowed to put one to eight and a half units up next to our subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10560)|
| 2:56:05| which is one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10565)|
| 2:56:06| All the property around, unless you go over the ridge, past the cell tower and the water tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10566)|
| 2:56:13| down on the eastern slope, there is a one to ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10573)|
| 2:56:19| But it's off of that screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10579)|
| 2:56:20| It's way to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10580)|
| 2:56:21| I don't want you to think that I'm standing up here saying that there's nothing close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| There's nothing close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10585)|
| 2:56:26| There is one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| But everything you can see is one to one and a half, one to five, one to three, one to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10587)|
| 2:56:35| And we feel that one to 12 units per acre is too much density in that area, and so is one to eight and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10595)|
| 2:56:43| Now, if they want to come back and go for a planned residential where it does have to go in front of the TTCDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10603)|
| 2:56:50| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10610)|
| 2:56:53| and maybe we can put some better restrictions to protect our home values in Harrison Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10613)|
| 2:56:59| and some of the other ones across the street on the other side of Thompson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10619)|
| 2:57:08| There has been some grading done on the property that has drastically affected the slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10628)|
| 2:57:13| since MPC looked at this four or five years ago in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| And there has been fines that have been levied against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10637)|
| 2:57:20| There was a 40 percent slope on part of this property that's now been kind of leveled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10640)|
| 2:57:26| So Mr. Garrett does have more usable land, I think, today than what he did have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10646)|
| 2:57:33| We just feel that an apartment complex in our back door is going to devalue our homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10653)|
| 2:57:41| especially those of us that live right up against the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10661)|
| 2:57:45| And that's mainly who you've heard from, and that's the people that are here today, because it directly affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10665)|
| 2:57:51| It's in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| And on the property to the north, the zoning can be, the density can be increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10672)|
| 2:57:58| All they have to do is go to the TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| It doesn't have to go back to MPC because that's the OB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| Right, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| So, you know, and I want to compliment Buzz because I made the comment in February or March that the TT, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10687)|
| 2:58:18| that the TTCDA was probably the most non-transparent arm of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10698)|
| 2:58:26| Now, they have come a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| They've updated the members that are on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10708)|
| 2:58:31| Buzz tells me that they're still working on fine-tuning some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10711)|
| 2:58:34| but the TTCDA is going to start notifying adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10714)|
| 2:58:39| That hadn't been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| So if somebody came in and wanted to increase the density, no one was found, no one knew about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10721)|
| 2:58:46| So they have come a long ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| But we feel that planned residential, one to five units per acre, is what needs to be in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10728)|
| 2:58:56| Because to the north of this area, you can kind of see the edge of an old roadbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10736)|
| 2:59:01| That's kind of right there at the top of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| So the property past that, the commercial, is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10744)|
| 2:59:08| But on this side, a low-density residential is what is all around this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10748)|
| 2:59:13| not 12 units or one to eight and a half units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10753)|
| 2:59:18| So we would ask that you vote this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10758)|
| 2:59:22| And I know on traffic studies, when Pellissippi State's in school, the traffic going in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10762)|
| 2:59:29| going for the six o'clock class is terrible and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10769)|
| 2:59:34| Dr. Briggs is out that way quite often, so is Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10774)|
| 2:59:38| We all know that cars are lined up at Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| Commissioner Anders did tell me today that the state is looking at some design study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10781)|
| 2:59:47| But that's going to be down the road, as we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| And, you know, Schaefer Road, there will be cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10790)|
| 2:59:54| There is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| We all know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10796)|
| 2:59:57| Everybody that lives in that area, Commissioner Anders, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| So we would ask that you deny this request because PR one to five is a much better zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10800)|
| 3:00:09| MPC staff said the exact same thing four and a half, five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| But now that they're going for the OB zoning, for some reason there are no traffic studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10815)|
| 3:00:19| There are no school studies like we see in all the other zonings that come before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10819)|
| 3:00:25| Even the new zoning, they've come up with the PR that's close to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10825)|
| 3:00:30| There's no traffic study information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10830)|
| 3:00:32| There's no school impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10832)|
| 3:00:34| And that's something that we feel is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10834)|
| 3:00:37| And I don't know if any of my other neighbors wanted to say anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| but it's not a one-man person against Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10840)|
| 3:00:47| So you're saying one to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10847)|
| 3:00:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10848)|
| 3:00:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10849)|
| 3:00:50| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10850)|
| 3:00:51| Yeah, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| Is there any concern about the present zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10853)|
| 3:00:56| You know, Mr. Seymour mentioned, you know, how they can put a lot of basically industrial in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10856)|
| 3:01:04| I mean, are you all worried about that or just take your chances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10864)|
| 3:01:07| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10867)|
| 3:01:08| We're not worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10868)|
| 3:01:09| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10869)|
| 3:01:10| It's like I just told Commissioner Anders in the back of the room a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| Yeah, with the zoning that's there now, it is kind of a crap roll as if you were in Vegas, someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10873)|
| 3:01:17| The zoning is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| But I think in reality, we all know the county's got lots of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10879)|
| 3:01:23| and there's lots of property out there for light industry where I'm sure if somebody's looking for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10883)|
| 3:01:30| this track with the location and the road access would probably be one of the last places they would look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10890)|
| 3:01:36| So that's where we're at on that, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10896)|
| 3:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10900)|
| 3:01:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10901)|
| 3:01:42| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10905)|
| 3:01:46| Arthur, rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10906)|
| 3:01:48| One, we're not asking for planned residential at 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| We're asking for the MPC recommendation on the existing BP zoning for planned residential at 8.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10912)|
| 3:02:04| We do not have a purchaser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| Mr. Garrett has owned this property for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| He thinks with the zoning that MPC has proposed, the property would be more merchantable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10929)|
| 3:02:15| We do not have to do traffic studies and issues like that until we come forward with a plan for development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10935)|
| 3:02:23| And then at that time, if appropriate, according to MPC standards, they ask us to do traffic studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10943)|
| 3:02:31| It may turn out to be a single-family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10951)|
| 3:02:35| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| We're just asking for flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| Right now, the access would be off Hardin Valley Road, which is a four-lane road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| via from Mr. Garrett's property to Hardin Valley would be by Iron Gate, which has a traffic light on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10966)|
| 3:02:55| So the access and traffic I do not see as an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10975)|
| 3:02:59| other than obviously there's more traffic out there on Hardin Valley than there was before they improved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10979)|
| 3:03:07| But that's just the nature of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10987)|
| 3:03:10| So we would ask that MPC staff be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10996)|
| 3:03:17| Hey, Arthur, is it part of the plan that or is it part of the requirements that the purchaser of the property has to redo that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=10997)|
| 3:03:26| the Iron Gate from Schaefer, the new alignment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| They have to pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| Is that part of the MPC process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11011)|
| 3:03:36| I'd better defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| They would have to get a good road into this property, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11019)|
| 3:03:44| That has to be redone before a development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11024)|
| 3:03:49| The road's existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| I'm talking about the new realignment of Schaefer Road over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11031)|
| 3:03:54| and to take it off the exit ramp and put it on Iron Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11034)|
| 3:03:58| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| We thought the state was going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| But Iron Gate exists now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| He would obviously have to make improvements to Iron Gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| and to the property when a development plan comes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11048)|
| 3:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11056)|
| 3:04:17| You know, I'll just kind of give you the other commissioner's word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| I'm on TTCDA, and it's been a difficult process for me because obviously the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11061)|
| 3:04:29| and the folks that own houses in Harrison Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11069)|
| 3:04:34| I've heard and spoke to several people in there, and some are firmly against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11074)|
| 3:04:39| and some are okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| And Mr. Garrett does have rights to his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11081)|
| 3:04:46| And, you know, the apartments out in Hardin Valley are almost virtually 100 percent rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11086)|
| 3:04:53| And so, I mean, there is a market for it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| And, you know, if you go out there and walk the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| you would think this is a perfect location for assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| or just that BP to TO there is just perfect for an assisted living type facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11103)|
| 3:05:11| And, you know, Arthur, if it goes through the TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11111)|
| 3:05:15| I'm not going to let you budge on the 100 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11115)|
| 3:05:18| I'm not going to let you budge on that's not going to be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11118)|
| 3:05:23| You know, most of the folks that are on TTCDA felt like that the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| if you're looking from moving from out of town, you're looking at Harrison Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11127)|
| 3:05:31| you look at the potential of industrial being behind you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| they think that's more of a detriment than it is a multifamily or OB or whatever we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11134)|
| 3:05:42| And so, I mean, there are a lot of things they can do with OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11142)|
| 3:05:46| But whoever buys this property, if it gets approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| there's not going to be any movement on that 100 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| And I'm going to ask for a large non-disturbance on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11152)|
| 3:05:56| because although Harrison Springs can't be guaranteed a view that they bought, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11156)|
| 3:06:04| with the fastest growing part of the county, they also don't need anything to their detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11164)|
| 3:06:09| So I'm still I think that industrial is not good for that plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11169)|
| 3:06:19| But, you know, not knowing, of course, being on TTCDA and you have a further review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11179)|
| 3:06:24| I feel a little bit better about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| But, I mean, there's still no matter what we do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| somebody appears that they think they're adversely affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11190)|
| 3:06:34| That's a difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11194)|
| 3:06:37| So I just kind of I guess Nick had something else he wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11197)|
| 3:06:41| Yeah, if you don't mind, just want to reiterate, you know, if this is rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11201)|
| 3:06:47| there really are no assurances for the property owners that are about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11207)|
| 3:06:53| Commissioner Anders and I have talked about a piece of property up at Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11213)|
| 3:06:58| TTCDA said you do this, this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| And that was to keep people from being able to view the building as they drove down Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11221)|
| 3:07:08| Well, they built the building and did not do this, this, and this if they were supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11228)|
| 3:07:13| The TTCDA asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| You know, luckily they had to come back a second time for approval on something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| and TTCDA was able to force them, well, hey, let's go back up here to this old issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11240)|
| 3:07:26| But in reality, you know, once the horse is out of the stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11246)|
| 3:07:30| there's no really authority for the TTCDA to come in and enforce anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11250)|
| 3:07:37| And so, you know, if a non-disturbance is possibly an option, but, you know, right here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11257)|
| 3:07:44| I just feel that this density with the property around it, it just doesn't mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11264)|
| 3:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11272)|
| 3:07:53| Thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11273)|
| 3:07:54| It is a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11274)|
| 3:07:55| Arthur, anything else for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| Then we'll wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11277)|
| 3:07:58| We'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11278)|
| 3:07:59| I would just point out this property lies between residential and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11279)|
| 3:08:05| There's commercial fronting Hardin Valley Road just to the north of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11285)|
| 3:08:10| This residential use, I think, provides protections for Harrison Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11290)|
| 3:08:18| And I understand that Tennessee Tech Carter Development Authority has already said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11298)|
| 3:08:23| you're not going to get around that 100-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| and we anticipate that there will be a no-disturb vegetation area around Harrison Springs also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11306)|
| 3:08:35| And we will advise potential purchasers of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11315)|
| 3:08:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11320)|
| 3:08:41| Brad, what was your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11321)|
| 3:08:42| Did we get it on the floor to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11322)|
| 3:08:45| You voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11325)|
| 3:08:46| Yeah, the motion was based on the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| You know, if we vote this in, this is not going to be something that the TTCDA just allows you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11329)|
| 3:08:56| whatever you carte blanche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| And if we have to, I'll follow suit against the new owner and the previous owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| to make sure that those TTCDAs are held to standard if they pass this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11342)|
| 3:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11348)|
| 3:09:09| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=11355)|
