| 0:11:40| So we are removing item 27 and item 34 from the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=700)|

| 0:12:45| Staff recommendation, approve the RN3 district because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| The hillside protection overlay would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=774)|

| 0:13:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Mr. Foster, if you'll approach the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=790)|
| 0:13:20| If you'd be so kind to state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| My name is Keith Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| My address is 2038 Eastfield Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Thanks for having me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| I appreciate the recommendation to RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| When we originally submitted to this, we wanted to go RN4 to be townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| So today I'm here to ask if you guys can approve RN4 for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| development of townhomes in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Was that a question or a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| I'm having trouble hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| It's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| I guess I'm here today to ask if my original application was for RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| and I want to build townhomes in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| So in order to do that, I need RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| RN3 is going to give me some limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| I think we'll be considering RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| I think we'll be considering that specific request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| Let's go to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| Mr. Chair, can we hear from staff as to the reason why they went with 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| instead of 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Ms. Hillman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| So most of the surrounding zoning here, as you can tell, is RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| This isn't really in a transitional area for more intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| However, there is recognition of some of the assets in the area that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| support more residential intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| RN3 would permit townhomes through special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| According to the minimum lot size standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| up to eight townhomes could be considered if the lots were merged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| And for these reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| we're recommending RN3 instead of RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| based on compatibility with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Thank you, Ms. Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| It seems like the case file indicates that RN4 being requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=936)|
| 0:15:46| the difference there is that it would include low-rise apartment buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| as opposed to just the townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| So if Hillman is correct in saying that we've got RN3 and it does allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| townhomes and the applicant is saying that they wish to build townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| it seems like RN3 would do that without expanding to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| low-rise apartment buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| which I'm assuming staff is assessing is really not congruent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| I agree with Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| and I also appreciate Jesse's analysis saying that it is more compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| with the surrounding RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| There is nothing that's surrounding that's in RN3 or RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| So I would like to make a motion to approve per staff recommendation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| zone RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| We have a motion by Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| seconded by Commissioner Adams to approve the RN3 per staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Seeing no other lights or questions, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Thank you, Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1039)|
| 0:17:35| Next we have agenda item number 12, subdivision Middlebrook Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| applicant developer Huber Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1061)|

| 0:18:36| Two variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1118)|

| 0:18:40| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| This is going to require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1121)|

| 0:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Motion, so do we only need two motions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1157)|

| 0:20:07| I live at 6316 Creekhead Drive, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| I have lived with my husband, Ron Ledbetter, for the better part of 49 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| I know this community quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| This piece of property has unusual topography with the hazards of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| railroad on the northeast side, heavy flooding and storm water runoff on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| northwest side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| There are sight distance issues surrounded by all narrow rural roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| One road in particular is Helmbolt Road where the proposed access site to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| development is planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| This area is known for flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| An existing detention pond exists right on the corner of Creekhead Drive and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| Helmbolt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| That's a part of Autumn Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| There are three residents designated within that subdivision to care for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| If it is not cared for, it is left alone, and we continually have flooding in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| The new subdivision pond is to be placed across the street from this existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| From this location, it's slightly north of it, and it's on a downslope, so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| continued flooding will be an issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| I can only assume that the new subdivision will further create flooding in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| The variances that are being requested for the development are excessive and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| will place a continued threat to public safety regardless which plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| approved by KPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| If I were a KPC commissioner, I would want to know the specific hardships of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| The explanations that are cited in the KPC staff recommendations are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| credible and valid explanations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Where is the evidence for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Existing issues with horizontal and vertical alignment along Helmbolt are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Why create a bad situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Why make it worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| These drastic reductions in variances that are being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| Item B on the staff recommendation list talks about existing unique road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| alignment on Helmbolt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Yeah, there is definitely unique alignment, and it would create a hazard with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| this new development, any new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| With item C as evidence that are cited, there will be significant financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| gain for the developer with the number of dwellings that are being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| In item D, it says, yes, there will be detrimental harm to public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| That's my yes, and the welfare and possible injuries of residents in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Helmbolt Road is known for the cars and trucks running off the road and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| ending up in a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| No shoulders exist and fatalities have occurred on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| The KP staff review meeting on 11-7 reference was made about the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| subdivision access road is the lesser of two evils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| If I were a KPC commissioner, I would not want to be approving this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| because it will be exposing City of Knoxville residents in this community in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Why not correct the situation and create a safer development by reducing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| number of dwellings permitted on this property, thereby helping eliminate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| need for excessive variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| This action would definitely protect and help existing residents who have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| ignored during decades of developments that have been added to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| We've been ignored without benefit of help with road safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| Therefore, I'm asking KPC commissioners to help the residents in the Amherst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| Helmbolt community and deny this applicant request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Thank you for your time and your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you for your comments, Ms. Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Again, Ben Mullins here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| I want to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| The applicant has looked at several different layouts for this property over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| the years, and every step of the way he has been engaging with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| They looked at some potential small form apartments, and the feedback was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| that the neighborhood wanted single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| Came back and looked at a potential proposal that had duplexes and town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| homes and single-family attached residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| And again, the feedback was that they wanted single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| So we've moved forward now with a single-family residential plan, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| Ms. Ledbetter is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| There are topographical issues with this property, which is the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| reason why hardships exist that create the need for the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| And there are only two variances that are being requested here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| There's the horizontal brokeback variance, which is related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| internal roads, and I think staff summed it up best in their explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| And also, to offset the issues with this variance, the speed for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| subdivision is going to be reduced from what normally was 30 miles per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| hour to 15 miles per hour to address the safety issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| Regarding the entrance, and Mr. Reynolds talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| significantly on Tuesday's meeting, really the location of the entrance on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| Hembel, which is a minor arterial street in the city, that's really the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| only place you can put the entrance to this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| You can't have realistic access, even though it does touch Francis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| you can't do access there, and there's right-of-way issues with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| railroad that terminate any potential access to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| So the only place that you could put it is at its location in Hembel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| Normally, what staff and city engineering want to see is it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| lined up with Creekhead, but that would create a whole host of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| issues because there's not adequate sight distance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| So in order to obtain the adequate sight distance, they moved it further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1606)|

| 0:26:52| Normally, you have the 400 feet of separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| The variance is to reduce it to 190 feet because that's the only place you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| can get the sight distance there on Hembel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Otherwise, this property wouldn't have any reasonable access for any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| reasonable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Mr. Reynolds explained that there's no queuing issues, and with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| traffic patterns for left turns for both of these entrances, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| shouldn't be any issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Now, I understand and I hear that there's existing flooding issues, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| there may be a detention pond at Autumn Place that hasn't been properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| maintained that's causing flooding to the north of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| This property is not going to cause or contribute to any additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| flooding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| We know the standards for stormwater, meeting Mr. Howley's stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| engineering, that the post flows off of this property have to be equal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| or less than what's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| That's why there's a very large detention pond right at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| because that's going to retain the water as it flows off of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| property so it doesn't cause any problems to the properties at Autumn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Place or on Creekhead Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| There may be existing traffic issues, but we have addressed the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| impact from this development as best it can be based upon the unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1683)|

| 0:28:11| I'd ask that you follow staff's recommendation and that you approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| for the 66 units subject to an additional unit, 67 units, if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| variance approved through the Knoxville Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you, Councilor Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1706)|

| 0:28:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Seeing that this is inside the city in an R2 zone with an overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| density of less than four per the acre, which is more than reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| with low-density residential that get developed these days and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| to work with the neighborhoods to not do multifamily, I think I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| to go ahead and make a motion that we approve the variances that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| requested, one and two, and the reasons given are the topography of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1764)|
| 0:29:33| existing property and the unique shape of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| Yeah, it is, but you also need to address C and D as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| On what's written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Read it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| We'll just need to make that as a basis of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Can I use this as an exhibit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1796)|

| 0:30:03| use this exhibit that was handed out as an attachment one as to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| reasons why the variances requested would be approved by those hardships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=1817)|

| 0:34:03| for the needs for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2045)|

| 0:34:36| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| We're reducing it to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| That's what the variance is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| The constraints that we've got, there's a lot of topography on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2082)|

| 0:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Mr. Howley, may I call upon you to get your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| Do you foresee any detriment to public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| health or welfare, or injuries to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| We don't see any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| We don't have an issue with that reduction from 75 to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| In this location, we believe that it will be safe and functional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| and in this location with the uses provided and the general residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2165)|

| 0:36:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| So we have a motion and we have a second, and I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| So all in favor on the variance request, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2190)|

| 0:38:02| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| We have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| If you'd like to approach the podium and state your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2289)|
| 0:38:18| My name is Ryan Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| I'm at 2704 Byington Beaver Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| The public comments I made already I don't want to repeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| I'm sorry for brevity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| but the public utilities there are not sufficient for the houses that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| The water service has been disrupted three times this year already with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| main breakage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| The water and sewer is not sufficient for the houses that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| Three different times we've been without it because it's not sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| So I don't want to keep repeating myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| But it's not within the interest of the public safety to think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| stacking 24 more houses in the backyard of that house is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| I'm sure you have the intention to approve whatever you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| but there's not sufficient room on the frontage of that lot to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| two-lane access road behind the house that they intend to keep and put 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| more houses in the backyard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| It doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| It's not reasonable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| So that's all I need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I'm sorry to take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2365)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you, commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| I do appreciate the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| We're at the zoning aspect of this development right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| If the zoning is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| whether it's the four units an acre that staff has recommended or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| five units an acre that the applicant is still requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| we'll have to come forward and PR zone with a full concept development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| plan that will have to address the issues with the utility capacity or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| access to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| And I think those are reasonable concerns and that will be addressed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| we move forward in this development, no matter what the vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| We are asking for the five units an acre that we originally requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| It's consistent with the growth policy plan in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| This is in the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| and it's also consistent with the low density residential sector plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| He is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| There is an intent to maintain the current home that's on the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| It's a fine home, nothing wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| We'd like to keep it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| but we would like then to have a small detached development on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| And the planned residential zone, as staff recommends and recognizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| is ideal for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| The RA zone would be you could develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| In fact, you could develop it at 4.35 units an acre technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| at least in theory, with the existing RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| But the PR zoning allows more flexibility and allows you to cluster the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| development away from the abutting industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| which is exactly how you'd want to do with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| But the difference between staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| and our request is four additional houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| And the concern about potential negative impacts from four houses is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| But the impact that that would have on the economies of scale moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| forward on a development of this small size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| less than five acres, is pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| And that's why we're asking for five units an acre to be permissioned to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| to develop this, try to design it in a way that would be compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| If you move the zoning map up so you're looking at the properties to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| south of the industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| you'll see that the properties that abut the industrial zone to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| are the first larger track is at one to five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| and there's one to nine dwelling units an acre below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| And we believe that that type of density is a better transition as you move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| from the more intense industrial zones to the lesser residential zones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| are there to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Byington Beaver Road is a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| It's 21 feet of pavement width, but there is 50 feet of right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| and it's a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| So whatever access we have to address at that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| we would have to work with TDOT to get that approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| And so there's likely to be some improvements to the frontage of that as we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| forward, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| is another reason why when you're looking at the economies of a development of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| this size, that additional density helps promote that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| This is in a desirable location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| It's in a growing location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| You're between, you see Carnes High School right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| It's actually in the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| But you also have Carnes Middle and elementary schools within one mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| So this is an area where you expect to be looking towards investing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| infrastructure and investing in affordable housing that would take advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| the community assets that are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| I'd be happy to answer any questions, but just looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| the difference between four and five are minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| Four is even less than what could conceivably done with the existing RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| And so we think that when you're looking for places to put homes in the kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| of market that we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| with the housing shortages that we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| with the influx of population that we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| this is a good place to take advantage of its location and its proximity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| the schools and have just a little bit more density here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| So I'd respectfully request that you would approve five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2638)|
| 0:44:07| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| Yeah, I've just been looking at the property on KGIS and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| I mean, it's bordered on two sides by industrial properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| zone properties, and of course, on the front side is a public right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| I definitely agree with staff's recommendation to provide a type A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| landscape buffer that will separate any type of residential from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| industrial side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| However, I do personally feel like the five units an acre would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| I mean, we always try to down step, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| between a heavier commercial area and two residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| and I think this is a perfect opportunity to do that at five units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| acre and not the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| You know, I feel like this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| I think staff's got it right at four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| I look at the property just south of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| and if this is to be rezoned to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| they're going to have industrial surrounding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| And this property actually, it does have industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| but it doesn't have any five dwelling units per acre or anywhere close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| On the other side of the tracks, there's some five DU, oh, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| there's some five DU on the other side of the tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| So I'm going to support staff on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| but I'll wait to hear other people's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Just had to think a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| There were two properties reference or two parcels referenced by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| That have a higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| And I apologize for asking this at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| but is it possible for staff to talk about those two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| if they were actually built out to what they were approved at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| Ms. Hanson, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| If you give me a moment, I can look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2777)|
| 0:46:36| Commissioner Adams, just for my own clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2796)|
| 0:46:48| are you referring to the two developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Actually, are they highlighted here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| The multifamily developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Is that what you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Yeah, I think these are the ones that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| Mullins was referring to as rationale for the five in the request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| Mr. Mullins, you want to comment on that to give us some clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| Yes, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Those were the two that I was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| And I don't know if they have been built out to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| They do look like they're multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| It's hard to tell looking at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| how many individual units are in each of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| But at this point, it looks pretty dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| And just looking at the aerials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| there's likely five to nine dwelling units an acre there from those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| And when you're just looking at the map and the zoning itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| sometimes they don't get built out to the actual density because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| issues that we often hear the neighbors say they're concerned about when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| you're in the design phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| You can't always do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| But it at least gives you permission to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| I think it's going to be difficult for us to give you an exact number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| what these are built out to because of the type of development that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Because they are multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| And I just did a quick search and the case files are old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| So I do know that the one that's the one to nine dwelling units breaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| has 324 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| I'm still trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| It's 76 for the one to the north for the one to three dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Or one to one to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| My,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| my point in asking is because while they may be approved for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| they may not be built out to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| And when we are at this point and looking for some type of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| Clue as to how is this area going to develop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| What makes the most sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| We look at, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| these other areas are approved for this particular density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| And if they're not really built out in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| then I think it may be a bit of a false reference point for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| And I think for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I do agree with commissioner Midas because staff is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| is including a good degree of density there with the four dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| I think it is correct that it's a transitional sort of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| Beside industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| That's the kind of thing that we, we want to see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| But if we go ahead and approve it for five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Then that becomes more rationale for the next development to say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| it's approved for five. And this is what we do in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| So I would feel more comfortable with four and would make a motion to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| to move ahead with staff's recommendation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| So commissioner Adams has made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Did I hear that correctly? You made a motion for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| We have a second by commissioner Midas and commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Thank you, chairman Hill. I just wanted to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| I think we've made this mistake in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| Knox county for many years, really, if you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| if you zoom in on the topography of this particular piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| I don't know if you can find that or not, or turn on the topo of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| It's it lays very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| We don't see a whole lot of property like that anymore in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| I mean, we've, we, we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Use lower densities and had larger lots and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| and haven't taken advantage of the parcels that are more conducive to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| to allow heavier density with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| And I'm just getting back to the five units maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| I mean, I feel like it's very appropriate for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| You know, if it was very steep, you know, if there was a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| there's a ridge or, or anything along that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| I wouldn't be as supportive of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| but I feel like the majority or all of this, none of it's in the HRPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| It all lays very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| So I think we should, as a body take advantage of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| of that situation personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Seeing no other lights, we have that motion on the table up to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| What do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3072)|

| 0:51:54| Applicant, John Severe Joint Venture and Red Door Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| Location, southeast side of East Governor John Severe Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| east of Conda Drive, 5.54 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| Present zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Zoning requested is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| Existing land use is agricultural, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3132)|

| 0:52:22| Staff recommendation is to approve the planned residential zone up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| five dwelling units per acre because it's consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3153)|

| 0:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| You'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| So let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Item 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| I don't see anyone signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| If the opposition would approach the podium and state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3180)|
| 0:53:11| My name is Caroline Dyer, and I live at 429 Carla Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| You may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| A little over 24 years ago, my parents, pregnant with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| bought a house on about an acre in Woodfield Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| Over the years, this property has proven itself nothing short of magical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| In the springtime, orb weaver spiders span their intricate webs between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| trees and across porches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| I don't know if everyone in this room sees spiders the way that I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| but their beauty is striking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| We always take orb weaver sightings as an omen of good luck, name them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| and watch them spin their unique combs within hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| But it's not just that they're pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| We have a symbiotic relationship with these spiders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| We allow them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| And in exchange, they eat bothersome mosquitoes, gnats, flies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| and other pests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| All we need to do for this gift is to give them a space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| They aren't the only creatures that do this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| East Tennessee is home to 19 species of bats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| And sure enough, they pay us visits on warm summer nights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| swooping across your entire field of vision in a split second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| each bat capable of eating half its body weight in mosquitoes every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| The pregnant and nursing moms can eat 100% of their body weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Mississippi State recently did a study to answer the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| do bats actually help reduce mosquito populations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| The answer was a resounding, unequivocal yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| In fact, scientists who study bats estimate these creatures may save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| farmers an estimated $23 billion a year by reducing the number of crop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| damaging insects and the need for pesticides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| All we need to do is give them a space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| The strip of woods between my home and the highway has not only acted as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| buffer between us and the cars, it gives us a space for the life cycles of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| these creatures and ensures that they continue to visit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| But it's not just mosquito prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| That's a drop in the bucket of what these woods give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| Woodfield Park is a neighborhood of gardeners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Not all of us but most of us have at least a little garden supplying our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| summer tomatoes or fall apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Many of us, however, use as much space as we can for the joy of growing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| and my family is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| Every summer on our little one acre, we grow enough veggies not only to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| our bellies but also to share with our neighbors and can some away for the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| I cannot put into words how much this practice has shaped me as a human and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| the way that I see the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| I see myself and my fellow humans in the dirt under my nails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| In a very real way, we are the land that feeds us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| For our way of life at Woodfield Park, for our way of life on planet Earth to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| continue with any shred of normalcy, we have to protect the pollinators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| To bulldoze these abundant woods in the name of overpriced module homes is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| only an insult to the land, but it will destroy the lives of countless species| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| of pollinators, rendering our tomato vines empty and our flowers dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| To bulldoze those woods is a death sentence to the creatures that keep our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| mosquitoes in check as well, meaning that more trucks will come to spread more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| pesticides and kill more pollinators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| This is a snowball effect that will not happen, that will not stop happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| until the greed stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| See, many of our native pollinators are cavity dwelling, meaning that they live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| in dead wood and hollow stems and brush piles in these little strips of woods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| between our developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| I've called this neighborhood home for 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| One of the most iconic images that comes to mind when I think of this place is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| the bunnies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| There are constant companions here, darting about, bringing smiles to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| faces of all who take their daily walks through our beloved streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| And there are always people out walking this neighborhood because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| It's a beautiful place to be, sheltered on all sides from the rest of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| an oasis amid a tangle of highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| The bunnies also play an important role in keeping weeds in check, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| weed whacking is still a task that must be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| Around our mailboxes and along the curb, the bunnies play their part in keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| the woods balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| In turn, the foxes play their part in keeping the bunnies in check so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| aren't the demise of our gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Yeah, we have a cabbage head or two gnawed on every year, but we abide by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| principle, if nothing is eating your garden, then your garden's not part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| an ecosystem, and our neighborhood is an ecosystem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| The beautifully long black rat snakes keep the mice away, and then they return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| to their brush piles and our precious strips of woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| All we need to do for this gift is to give them a space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| Seeing natural spaces in my hometown continue to shrink with frankly hideous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| eyesores of modular homes pop up in their stead is heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| I grew up playing in these woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| I retreated there in times of crisis when I needed solitude with the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| and the bird song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Ms. Dyer, if you could wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| I'm almost finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| A walk through my home sounds like the wind whispering through trees and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| songs of a dozen species of birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| I hope that today we make a choice to preserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| I want to advocate for the woods to be left standing, but I know that that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| battle already lost to your corporate greed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| Today I'm asking for the decision to be made that only two houses are built per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3508)|

| 0:59:10| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| My name is Adam Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| I also reside in our beautiful Woodfield Park at 443 Carla Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| Ms. Dyer has painted a beautiful picture of our subdivision, and she's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| We do have a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| I've called Woodfield Park home for over 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| I do have a contingency with us here today from our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| I would like to acknowledge them just with a quick hand raise, if you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Our neighborhood is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| We are a tight, very close-knit community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| We're not opposed to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| We realize that development is what perpetuates and builds our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| We have one simple request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| We do request that, as this development is proposed, that our neighborhood is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| considered, specifically with population density and also with character and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| style of that which is already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| We are a well-established neighborhood with stable and positively trending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| property values, and we have been so for the past 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| We acknowledge that the development will happen in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Our simple petition is that would you allow us to come alongside you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| provide input into the development process, specifically to the density itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| We'd also request that you allow us to speak into the design and character of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| the homes so that it is in alignment with that which is already established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you for hearing our petition this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| Could I get your address, please, Mr. Montgomery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| 443 Carla 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Is that it for opposition, I believe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Would the applicant like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| And if you need additional time, I'll give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| I was a bit generous with the time on the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| You'll get equal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| My name is Brad Ferber, and I'm speaking on behalf of Red Door Homes of East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3662)|

| 1:01:14| I would like to thank the commission and members of the community for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| opportunity to speak about our request for rezoning parcels 12420002 and 12420003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3676)|
| 1:01:26| from agricultural to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| I would also like to recognize the opposition presented by the members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| the Woodfield Park neighborhood, which adjoins the parcels on the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| and west boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| The oppositions from the residents from the Woodfield subdivision center on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| three main objectives, traffic, density, and architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| Traffic is an ever-growing concern for Knox County, and John Sevier Highway is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Turning left from Conda Drive onto John Sevier Highway is the main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| Our initial concept plan shows a new cul-de-sac street joining Conda Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| This would increase traffic volume at this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| The subject property has multiple options for access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| Conda Drive to the west, Arthur Harmon Drive to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| and John Sevier Highway to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| As opposed to a cul-de-sac, a new road could be designed to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| Arthur Harmon Road to Conda Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| This would minimize traffic at the intersection of Conda Drive and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| John Sevier Highway and provide a second outlet for neighborhood residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| Another option would be to create a cul-de-sac neighborhood with the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| from Arthur Harmon Road, eliminating all impacts to Conda Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| A third and less likely option would be to create a new access from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| I also believe that there may be an opportunity to work with Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Department of Transportation to potentially improve the intersection at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| Conda Drive and John Sevier Highway by creating an outgoing westbound turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| lane to help merge with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| I say all this to outline that the density should be approved per staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| recommendations, giving time to perform proper traffic studies and create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| plans to best accommodate the existing neighborhood as well as provide for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Density is a common concern for the members of the Woodfield Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| I feel like density relates to the traffic concerns but also to maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| the feel of the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| The population in Knox County has almost doubled from 263,000 in 1965 when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| Woodfield was developed to 494,574 in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| As the population increases, demand for housing rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| To meet the growing demand, few developments geared towards moderately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| priced housing offer half-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| The request for two dwelling units per acre is not consistent with what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| property will support or the need for housing in this planned growth sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| Architecture is the third main concern that has been expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| As mentioned in several of the public comments, Woodfield is a neighborhood of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| well-kept, architecturally pleasing homes with large yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| As builders, we must develop desirable homes with similar values to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| surrounding properties to be marketable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| The ability to attain home mortgage depends on the appraisal value of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| property driven by the surrounding market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| Our research indicates that the market needs homes in the price range of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| $375,000 to $425,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| New brick homes with 2,000-plus square feet on half-acre lots is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| marketable product in this area given today's development and building costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| Our new homes will carry a value of approximately $177 to $220 per square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| foot, which would increase nearby property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| The average sale price per square foot of the Woodfield Park subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| averages $134 a square foot based on the 10 homes that have sold since 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3874)|
| 1:04:41| In 2019, this property was reviewed for rezoning and the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| recommendation was to approve up to five dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| The commission made a motion to approve three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| which was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Since the desired density was not met at that time, the case was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| Today we come before you with a second staff recommendation to approve up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| to five dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| plan designation and would allow development compatible with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| surrounding land uses and zoning patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| The staff asked that three conditions be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| We are glad to oblige those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| I request that the commission consider the significant change in housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| demand since 2019 and recognize that the proposed rezoning from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| agricultural to PR5 presents an opportunity to meet the demand where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3920)|

| 1:05:27| We asked that the commission motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| The question of density should be carried to allow proper development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3930)|

| 1:06:34| a lot of similarity to me with the one that we just heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| as well as the one that we're about to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| I'm coming from the perspective of a density is being requested that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4001)|
| 1:06:49| not necessarily in alignment with what is in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| When you look at the properties right beside it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| thank you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| And then across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| those are not at five dwelling units per acre and the buffer zone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4023)|
| 1:07:13| John severe requires actually in my mind provides a buffer there that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| obviating the need for a transitional sort of space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| What I mean is we'll, the case, just a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| we were talking about transitions from industrial to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| And in this case, we have a highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| but there's a significant buffer there that the houses in that residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| the one that's being proposed, they would be protected by that buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| So you've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| a development that's right beside another one that's been there for quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| And the one that's been there for quite a while is somewhere around the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| The one across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| While approved for five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Boeing it's breaker is also actually built out at two dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| So I actually don't agree with staff on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| I don't agree with staff on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| So I actually don't agree with staff on this one and feel like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| While someone made the comment that we can build this out to this degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| it's actually not consistent with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| And we have a number of community members here who are saying they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| they are not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| They understand that there's a housing crisis and that there needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| And so I don't agree with staff on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| I don't agree with staff on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| And I'm just asking to be a part of the process and for it to be part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| the consistent development there to be two dwelling units breaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| which I think is incredibly reasonable and shows a good faith to try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4126)|
| 1:08:54| work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| So I do not support the motion that's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| And if it doesn't pass would make a motion to go with two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| I guess I'm just zooming out again and looking at the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| It looks like the, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| it's partial on John Spear highway, which is a heavily traveled highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| And, and, and you'll get its location from Chapman highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| which is most certainly a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| it's probably maybe a quarter mile off of a major thoroughfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| commercial thoroughfare, all of its commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| all the way around a quarter mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| You'd walk to, to me from a density perspective, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| where else do you want to put the density? I mean, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| it's close to commercial. It's on a busy street. I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| I respect the neighborhoods and, and in there, they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| they're actually zoned RV right now, which is general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| Somebody could come in to that existing neighborhood and build duplexes or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| you know, things like that. If, if, if they took the house out I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| I think planned residential at five allows more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| you know, ways to develop it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| And it doesn't necessarily mean they have to take all the trees down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| You know what I mean? You can still keep buffers in there and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| and you know, the, the, the wildlife as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| but just from a pure planning perspective where it's located on John Spear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| highway, as well as the, the, how close it is to Chapman highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| I feel like the vibe is probably appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you. Commissioner Huber. Okay. So commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| Just to respond to commissioner Huber's note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| I don't know where you would put the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| I think the answer has already in front of us in that sort of triangle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| shape in middle of the commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| which is zoned for up to nine dwelling units breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| So I think there is a recognition in that area of where the density needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| And then this is an opportunity for us to help support the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| that exist there and respond to community speaking out and saying that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| do want to work with development and have a voice in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| Thank you, commissioner Adams. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| So we have a motion and a second before us to approve a planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| zone up to five dwelling units breaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| because it's consistent with the sector plan designation and would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| development compatible with the surrounding land uses and zoning pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| subject to the denoted three conditions. All in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| say aye. Any opposed? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| We have two noes. Mr. D.R. Mund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| Motion carries. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4302)|
| 1:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| Agenda item 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4314)|

| 1:12:02| Location, northeast side of Gettysbue Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| northeast of Polo Club Lane, 5.05 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| Present plan designation and zoning is low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| open space and hillside protection and planned residential up to three dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| units per acre. Proposed plan designation and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| medium density residential slash office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| hillside protection and planned residential existing land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| private recreation, density proposed 18 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| Motion one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| staff recommendation is to deny the sector plan amendment to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| to the MDRO land use classification because it is inconsistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| surrounding development and does not meet the location criteria for MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Motion number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| staff recommendation deny the planned residential zone up to 18 dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| units per acre because it is inconsistent with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| and does not meet the location criteria for MDRO land use classification in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| the Southwest city sector plan. And before us is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for Ron Watkins and Synergy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| And do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| A little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| A bit of a silly question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| It was for the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| I'll defer. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| I need to mention I talked to legal the other day and I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| I need to disclose I'm a member of Getty Zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| but I have no financial gain or loss for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| I just wanted to state that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Thank you for that disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4441)|

| 1:14:12| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| I represent several residents within the Getty's view subdivision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| strongly oppose the requested sector plan amendment and the rezoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| increase the density up to 18 dwelling units per acre to avoid any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| confusion. It's the fine people in the yellow shirts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| We're able to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| But as you can see, there's strong support here opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| Most of you, I'm sure, if not all are familiar with the Getty's view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4478)|

| 1:17:26| be designated along major thoroughfares. These are collector arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| streets. Getty's View Drive, where this property is located, is neither| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4652)|

| 1:17:43| As you are familiar with the subdivision, you probably recognize or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| have known the steep topography and grade slopes that are in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| Getty's View subdivision. The property throughout has significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| hillsides. The property here in question has a significant slope or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| hillside, so the south of the property is where the tennis courts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| located. That is relatively flat, but as it goes to the north, north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| northwest, towards the cul-de-sac and the single family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| homes, it's a steep grade and drops off significantly. Based on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| significant slope, two of the buildings, what is on the screen is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| plan that was submitted in 2020 that was later withdrawn for 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| condominium units. My understanding is that the 90 condominium units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| will have the same layout, except that there will be a building where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| the tennis courts are. So you can see on the north side, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| steep grade of the property. Based on the steep grade, the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| would have to construct a significant foundation block wall. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| block wall would probably be about half the height of the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| structure. I mean, you'd be looking at 45, maybe 50 feet of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4744)|

| 1:19:12| family homes, and then we'll tower over them. This structure could end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| up being approximately, you know, total height of 100 feet in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| area. I'll wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| I'm sorry, can you wrap up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| Yes, sir. So, here on behalf of these residents, a lot of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| long-time residents of the Gettysburg community, and ask that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| follow staff's recommendation and deny the sector plan amendment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| the rezoning PR up to 18 dwelling units per acre. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4777)|

| 1:19:57| here today. I appreciate the opposition being here to speak. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| think coming forward to these public meetings and expressing your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| opinions is one of the most important things we do. We were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| almost prevented from doing that based upon a lawsuit trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| enjoin us from even going through the zoning process, and I'm glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| that that was not successful. We're able to have this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| The opposition focuses on a development and a site plan, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| isn't currently before this body for consideration. Now, it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| in the past. In fact, it was that type of layout with the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| condominium units on Mr. Watkins' property was considered for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| during Getty's View's inception in 1994. There was a site plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Watkins' property. There was a similar site plan that was proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| and then withdrawn in 2020. But we're not looking at the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| and looking at the retaining walls. We have to come back before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| body to do that, depending upon the results of today's meeting. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| talking about a site plan that was proposed and then withdrawn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| 2020. We're not looking at the site plan and looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4866)|

| 1:21:17| looking at the retaining walls. We have to come back before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| to do that, depending upon the results of today's meeting. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| talking about the density today, and I do appreciate Ms. Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| looking at the density of when a property has been built out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| comparing that. This property hasn't been built out yet. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| Getty's View as a community hasn't been built out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| I appreciate the public process. This has been an undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| parcel in Getty's View for quite some time, but from its beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| it was always earmarked to be some type of villa, some type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| attached housing. The 60 units has always been considered on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| But in the letter that I submitted, and I hope everybody did get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| chance to see it and all the comments that were placed on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| property, the overall density calculations for this, it's a high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| 125.8 acres that's currently in the PR zone. That's taking out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| part that was annexed by the city and the OS, which includes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| clubhouse and the golf course. So it's 125.8 units. Currently in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| Getty's View there's 250 units. Three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| which is what it's zoned now, would allow a total of 377 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| So there is still available density within the current existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| zoning at PR at three units an acre. And again, this piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| property is one of the last ones that could be developed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| community. Staff recognize, and I attached the e-mail, there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| some e-mails between Mr. Reynolds and Alan Grissom at Cannon &| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| Cannon, who was the engineer working on this project, that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| can't transfer the density to the tennis courts. And that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| reason why this zoning is necessary. Not for the Watkins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| property. We can turn around tomorrow and find a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| file an application for something on the Watkins property that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| close to 60 dwelling units an acre, and that would be accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| Now, we don't know if it would be improved, we don't know how it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| would be designed, but that is allowed to move forward with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| development plan on it. It was the inclusion of the tennis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| courts, which was requested by the golf club, the country club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| to allow them some additional units, because they saw a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| benefit to the health of the community itself and the health of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| the country club. They want to be able to move the tennis courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| relocate the tennis courts, do some changes to the golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| itself, and these types of units are intended to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| people that want to live within walking distance of a country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| club. That's the market for it. They want to be able to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| traffic coming into the communities, they want to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| reduce traffic coming into the communities, have people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| members that are coming to the country club, they can live closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| to it, a retirement type community. And all of this has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| talked about. The country club reached out, there's a letter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| Todd Froll, who's the CEO of the country club, outlining all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| the reasons why they wanted, they approached Mr. Watkins and wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| to add the tennis court property to that to give them additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| units potentially to help the country club. And that's why this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| is before you today. If this is approved, we'll come forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| a development plan, we'll look at what does that look like to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| community, and that will get fully vetted out, and I'm sure there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| will be lots of public input in that process. If it's denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| then we'll look at what other options we have. But we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| appreciate your consideration here today. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5099)|
| 1:25:06| The tennis court is currently zoned PR as well, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| Mr. Reynolds, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| That is correct. It's also zoned PR up to three dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| So the project could still be built on the tennis courts with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| existing density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| Correct, at three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| There was mention by the applicant about building out available to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| do 60 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| How is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| If you look at the email, there were 60 units that were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| on this parcel in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| In 2003, they came forward with a different proposal for, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| 19 attached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| And then in 2020, they went back with a similar proposal to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| was approved in 1999 for the 60 units, and that was always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| accepted by staff because from the plans from Gettysburg at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| beginning, the Watkins property was always earmarked to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| type of villa, kind of higher density next to the clubhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| development. Now, exactly what that looks like isn't before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| right now, but at one time, there was a plan very similar to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| designs that you saw up on the board, and that's what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| community is looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| But with the current density, you can't transfer, as I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| staff's opinion on this, even though if you included the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| tennis courts, you would still be within the existing three units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| an acre, even if we did 90 units on those two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| Because the Watkins property was always earmarked to be attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| to some type of villa unit, they will allow the density to still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| go at that location, but they won't let you transfer the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| density to a parcel that is not under Mr. Watkins, that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| didn't own, that wasn't considered for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| So that's kind of the unique quirk in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| The density we're talking about, if you look at just on this spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| that's highlighted here, is high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| But when you look at it spread over the entire development, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| still within the current three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| If staff, if they were to come back with an application for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| development plan with 60 units on the parcel, not counting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| tennis courts, would that be allowed or permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| We have allowed that consideration, and we continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| express that we feel that that's appropriate based on the earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| approvals on the property, that there is an intent for at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| 60 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| Okay, and if they were to combine with the tennis court, combine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| those properties, would that go away completely, or would they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| still just be limited to that 60 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| If they combined with the tennis property into the existing lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| I mean, they could definitely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| I would probably have to discuss how it gets, how units could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| allocated in that way, because it is on plan residential at three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| drawings per acre, so there can be residential construction on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| that site. We just have to probably talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| through what exactly could happen on that part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| versus the larger parcel itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| So would it be appropriate to, looking at the parcel that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| eligible for 60 units an acre, would it be appropriate to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| that have a zoning that matches the 60 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| Well, we've already determined they don't really need to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| based on the previous approvals. It would be better to maintain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| low-density residential land use that's over the entire property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| and just recognize that there was the intent to at least have 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| units there at one point in time and allow that consideration under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| Okay, that's all for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| You know, I guess I look at this right now and our decision is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| And, you know, regardless of whether the 60 units, if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| continue with their plan for 60 units, this would have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| through a process again, is that correct, Mike, to change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| zoning from low-density residential to medium-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| For the, well, they would not need to go to medium-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| residential to propose the 60 units that were previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| approved on the site. We felt that a new development plan would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| be required regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| What would come through the Planning Commission would be an open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| public review and an approval process, but a new or a change to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| the sector plan would not be required in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| It would still be low-density residential because the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| site is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| Okay, so explain it to me again. That's because it was previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| approved under low-density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| Yeah, it was previously approved under the low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| land use classification and under the current plan residential at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| There's been an approval that says there was a transfer of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| density, which the plan residential zone does allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| The current request, where they're expanding that area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| wanting to expand the number of units, it's the rub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| From a staff perspective, we feel the most appropriate thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| to request the density that would allow the units that they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| to move up and subsequently they would have to amend the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| plan to get that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| Okay, all right. Thank you for that clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| Commissioner Barger. Mike, I should know this, but is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| a height restriction in plan residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| Let me look, just verify real fast, but my question is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| Well, for houses, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| From what they've asked before, I think it's up to this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| Commissioner Schelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| I'll move to deny the request for staff recommendation for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| I don't see how it meets any of the criteria for a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| Okay, so we have a motion by Commissioner Schelson to deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| sector plan amendment per staff recommendation, seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| I still see no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| All in favor say aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion to deny the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| Just real quick, I'd like to clarify, I accidentally put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| southwest city sector plan and the staff recommendation should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| be southwest county sector plan. I just want to clarify that real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Southwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| And do we have a corrected motion and a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| So we have a motion by Vice Chair Uten to deny the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| residential zone per staff recommendation, seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5606)|

| 1:35:27| a shod road, a large development going through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5727)|

| 1:35:35| At the end of my road, when it rains hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| when I leave my house the next morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5739)|

| 1:35:58| Let's take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5758)|

| 1:36:21| and that's under process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5781)|

| 1:36:29| I don't think it's fair to some of us in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| without you guys looking outside where this water is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| Let's take a look and see if we can do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| to improve the discharge of the water in the creeks around us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| so that the surrounding neighbors don't have to drive through the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| is what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231109?start=5808)|
