| 0:01:35| I got a text from Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| She'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| She's just running just a little bit late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| I want to turn this over to Councilman McGreeve for opening remarks and take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| One of the things that we plan to do tonight is we have the opportunity to discuss the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| And I want to say to all of you that I know you've received a lot of information in the last couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| And I wanted to be sure that as information comes in to us that you receive those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| that have to do with the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| A couple of things I'd like to do before we get started, and we have put together an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| And one of the things is that we'd like to discuss the major items that have to do with the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| And these are really major items that both the chamber, Scenic Knoxville, and a number of neighbor folks have put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| But I think there's some things that we need to do before that to sort of set the groundwork for why we are where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| and how we got to this after two years, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| Not too bad, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| I tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| But in order to get started, we've had an awful lot of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| But before we get started, some of the signed task force members are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| And I just want to run through very quickly who those folks are that were on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| or are still on the committee, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| George Wallace is vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Joyce Feld, I don't know if she's made it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Gary Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Gary's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Thank you, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Melissa McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Jim Nixon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Don Parnell is in the back of the room there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Bill Weigel is recovering quite well and is out of the country at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| The staff members that helped us, Mark Donaldson, Ann Wallace, Cindy Mitchell, Anita Cash, and Angela Ruber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=199)|
| 0:03:27| So those were the folks that were on our task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Very quickly, it's amazing how time does go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| But to let you know that, of course, one of the major issues that we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| both in terms of neighborhoods, scenic Knoxville, and the chamber, has to do with the height of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| And I wanted to just fill everybody in that actually on November 15, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| City Council approved on its first reading heights of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| That was actually the charge at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| And actually on first reading, what was agreed to, there were four categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| and there was a sign height that was agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| At that particular meeting and subsequent meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| it was decided to really take a look at the sign ordinance, not only in terms of sign heights, but signs in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| And so that's how this thing grew from where it was to where it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| The one thing that I'd like for council to think about as we begin the discussions on sign heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| and a few other items is that one of the things that we need to do is we all need to be in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| in terms of what we feel the character of our city needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| What is it that we want it to look like and how do signs play a role in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| So one of the things that I think was that we had to charge very early on was how do we protect the beauty of our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| And one of the ways is that we look at the signage that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| But at the same time, when we do this, when we think about the beauty of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| we also want to really take into consideration a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| When I talk about balance, what I'm talking about is that definitely we have the public interest at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| We're concerned about what the general population thinks about their city and what they think about signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| But at the same time, we need to also think about sign owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| We need to think about the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| We need to think about the manufacturers of the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| We need to think about folks that install the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| We need to think about the whole business of signs as well as what we want our environment to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| At the same time, we need to be able to give the ability to create signs to the designers of those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| So it's not just a matter of looking and saying, gee, we don't like a certain size and a certain height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| And I think over the last two years, the sign task force has definitely been trying to look into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| and trying to come up with a balance that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| And I'll get into that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| When we talk about balance, as I mentioned, and I want to reiterate again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| we're talking about the balance between the business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| and the public interest in protecting the character of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| So we want to regulate our signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| We want to have a community where we do have regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| But at the same time, one of the things that the task force really looked at was how do we enforce it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| which is something, again, that I want to talk to council about this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| The agenda that I've put together is one that really has to do with a number of issues that came from both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=396)|
| 0:06:45| in terms of where we are in the sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| And so one of the things that I'd like to do is, if you all will take a look at your signed ordinance that you gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=408)|
| 0:06:56| is that I think that we want to be sure that we have an agreement on what the purpose of our signed ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| And let me just go through that very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| Under the purpose, the purpose of this section is to create a legal framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| for a comprehensive and balanced system of signed regulations that will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| and this is one of the things that we need to listen to and all come to some kind of an agreement on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| implement the plans, policy, goals, and objectives of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and the business of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| preserve the right of free speech and expression, provide for effective communication between people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| within the context of their environment, avoid visual clutter that may be harmful to traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| and pedestrian safety, property values, business opportunities, and community appearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| facilitate effective wayfinding throughout the city, provide a clear and objective signed standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| provide an efficient and effective review procedure for signed applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| and enable consistent and equitable enforcement of the regulations set forth in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| With these purposes in mind, it is the intent of this ordinance to authorize the use of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| that are effective in communicating with the public, compatible with their surroundings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| legible in the circumstance in which they are seen, appropriate to the activity that displays them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| and expressive of the identity of individual activities in the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| The signed task force worked several meetings on coming up with the purpose of what this ordinance is all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| and where we are with signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| So with that in mind, and if you folks have some comments that you want to make or add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=515)|
| 0:08:43| what I'd like to do is, on your agenda, you'll see B, which has to do with signed heights by districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| One of the things that we needed to do before we determined signed heights is we wanted to make sure that the ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| and you should have a copy of the chart ñ that we wanted to make sure that we were talking about where signs were located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| And we came to an agreement that what we were really talking about were signs within 500 feet of the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| interchange, signs adjacent to federal highways, all eligible, all other eligible roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=550)|
| 0:09:19| and then signs adjacent to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Let me repeat that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Signs within 500 feet of the interstate, interchange, signs adjacent to an interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| adjacent to a federal highway, and all eligible roadways on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| Now, when city council met in November of 2011, what was agreed to in terms of the heights of signs at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=574)|
| 0:09:43| were within 500 feet of an interstate exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| It was 25 feet was what they were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Adjacent to an interstate would be 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| Adjacent to a federal highway was 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| All other eligible roadways were 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| Now, this was for ground or pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| That was what city council approved on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| After extensive use or extensive discussions, and it was not a unanimous agreement with the signed task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| but they came up with a recommendation, and it's in the sign ordinance draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| that those signs within 500 feet of the interstate would be 40 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| Adjacent to the interstate would be 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Adjacent to federal highways would be 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Adjacent to all other eligible roadways would be 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| That was the last thing that was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| It was a vote of six to two that came up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| So I think that if council is interested, that that's where we're on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=640)|
| 0:10:49| And, George, would you like to add something to that in terms of what we talked about in terms of heights of signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=649)|
| 0:10:59| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Anybody want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| Just open comment about sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Yeah, sign heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Not so much sign height as I remember some brief discussion about this at the last workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=673)|
| 0:11:22| and that is billboards, which are not addressed anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| Bring me up to date on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Billboards are not allowed in the city, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| No additional billboards, but as we heard last time, apparently there's been some tweaking of that, in my words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=690)|
| 0:11:38| Well, and, Mark, you might jump in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| It's my understanding that, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| there was a billboard adjacent to the interstate there at Kingston Pike and Winston Road that was moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| It was on the same piece of property on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Is that the one you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| I was actually listening to Joyce Feld and what she had indicated last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| and it sounded like there were greater violations than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| And I'm not sure that's a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Well, we looked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| We looked into that a lot, which is a totally separate issue than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| But we looked into that, and they're still looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| And, you know, whether you want to close the loophole that you can move a billboard on existing property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| you know, move it within the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| And I think, you know, you run into state law and run into a lot of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| but we're still looking into that, whether we can close that loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| But I'll say this, Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| I mean, we did spend a lot of time, and I think these four classifications are really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| And this is a big change from the current sign ordinance that you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| What you have now is you have an ordinance that is dovetailed into your zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=764)|
| 0:12:52| So you can have a C2 zoning right next to an O1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| and you've got different signs on the same highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| So it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| So this is looking at, and Mark gave at the time a very eloquent description of why this made sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=780)|
| 0:13:07| because it was based on the speed of the vehicle that's reading that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| It's faster on against the interstate, and it's slower on your roads and then everywhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| So it made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| And that's how, logically, we got to this four areas, which I think it's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| I'm not afraid to say that I was not in favor of one of those two non-votes on the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=805)|
| 0:13:34| because it makes no sense to me that if you have a higher sign at the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| you would have a slightly less height to sign on a second tertiary road, you know, within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=820)|
| 0:13:49| So that doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| I think the way it's laid out here makes sense that it steps down as you go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| So, I mean, I think that's one of the first things we ought to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| But I think when you look at signs, you've got to realize that today's signs, the way buildings face it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| the building becomes the sign in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| The architectural design of a building becomes, in essence, their brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| The color of it, the architectural style of it, the way it's shaped, the way it looks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| the way it fits on their site becomes their brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| And the color of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| And so you've got to realize that even you can look at fast food companies that incorporated their whole brand into their sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=864)|
| 0:14:33| I mean, into their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| But signs today are less important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| So why regulate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Well, you have to regulate it because people are always going to use the most sign that they can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| I, as a business owner, have looked at and built signs, and I look first at the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| and I say, what's the maximum width and height that I can have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| And I come down from there to maybe to fit my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| But I could do, you know, do better with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Successful businesses aren't tied to having the largest sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| The well placement of those signs in the branding of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and the colors is probably more important than the tall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| If it were true that all businesses would have the largest sign possible and all would be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| So, I mean, it's not always tied to the largest sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| You've got to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| With the stated purpose that you read so eloquently that, you know, it's the visual clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| And that's really what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| You know, can we improve the visual clutter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| And this is a long-term, this is not going to have an immediate impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| You're not going to see immediate impact on sign change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| This is something that will happen slowly over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| And I would say that it's not something that you say, well, I want to tweak it every 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| I think you want to get it right once and look at long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| You can't make people take down signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| You can't make people reduce their signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| You have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| They're grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| They're protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| They're protected by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| So they're not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| They're not going to change overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| But it's something that's long-term as you go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| And I think you just have to look at that and think a lot longer and broader scale than immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| So, you know, I think these categories are well stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| You know, you can be argued, and I think that's really what we want to kind of get into tonight is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| does the rest of this council think that these four categories make sense or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| I believe they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Mr. Chair, Mark, do you want to go ahead and just briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Let me recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Yeah, I'm a little confused now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| You said the original council listing had four categories and four different sign heights permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| Now you say the task force wrestled six to two and came up with four categories with these sign heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| But you only have two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Either you're at the interchange or you're anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| I mean, one's 40 foot and the rest of the three are 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| So what's all this fancy distinction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| You don't have any distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| I thought the original concept was that, and you actually alluded to it from Mark's group, was, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| if you're going 35 miles an hour, you don't need as much of a sign as if you're going 50 or 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| And, you know, maybe the speed limit is 55 or 60, but people probably do more than that on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| It's just the reality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| So what's different from interchange and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| So I have that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| It's like we really only have two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| If you're near a road, if it's a road-based system, it's not really a district thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| It's either on the interstate and then adjacent to an interstate, a federal highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| and I assume some major local road that's almost as big and fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| But I don't know what you have for slower areas that have more just, you know, collector road status or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1076)|
| 0:18:04| There's no coverage on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| So I've got that level of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Secondly, something George alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| It makes sense that if you have a little checkerboard of zone classifications, that it's kind of crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1092)|
| 0:18:20| One guy gets a big sign, the other guy gets a little sign, the third guy gets no sign or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| But on the other hand, we're now introducing, and I saw someone's comments in the pile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| we're now introducing poll signs to office districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| And that seems to be pro-clutter rather than anti-clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| So I guess I'm trying to decide if the world should be ruled by four categories where three of them are identical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| or whether we need some other aspect to break signs into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| And I'll grant you that if you're going, like I said, 60 or 70 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| you've not got much time to absorb the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| So maybe a bigger sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| And this is talking about height and not the sign face, so I don't know whether that varies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| and that's why you have four districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| But there's some confusion there, Dwayne, so maybe you've got an answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| But I didn't get how we ended up with four districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| We ended up with two on the interchange or anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| I always want to make sure he's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| I think I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| So the four categories had to do with the, again, Mark can explain how those four categories were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| But the one thing that we haven't discussed is monument signs, that each one of these districts also have monument signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| And there are different heights for the monument signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| And what we're talking about right now are ground or pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| And that's how that developed into that, those heights on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Remember that right now what we have in all districts are signs of 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| All signs can be 50 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| And so the compromise from the 50 feet down to the 30 feet is where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| But the four categories, again, we still have monument signs which have a certain maximum height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| which has to be determined also on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| There's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| And I add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| Well, it's even more complicated than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| Keep in mind that the latest draft of the task force version of the code is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1232)|
| 0:20:42| It's the latest draft coming from one of the groups that will have input into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| The four categories first appeared through a recommendation from the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| to consider the functional classification of the adjacent roadway when you draft regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| with regard to sign height and sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| That held up through the first reading of the ordinance with different dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| than the planning commission recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| And, frankly, the reversion to simply two categories was, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| observing the task force simply because they couldn't agree on any numbers to fill in the blanks on four categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1289)|
| 0:21:37| And it was, in fact, very much a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| But you really have two, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| I mean, you have two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| As recommended by the task force at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Now, you will also receive a recommendation from the planning commission, finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| and ultimately it will be up to the city council to decide what direction they really want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| So right now, well, right now the current code is a monoculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| One size fits all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| The maximum height of all detached signs is 50 feet, whether it's a monument sign or a pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| The recommendation from the planning commission was to tie those dimensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| to the functional classification of the roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| and to create a different standard for monument signs much smaller in scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| than would be applied to pole signs and other ground signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1349)|
| 0:22:37| That held up through several months, if not quarters, of discussion with the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| But in the end, they ended up voting on the two different heights for all signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1363)|
| 0:22:53| And no monument sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| No differentiation between the maximum height of a monument versus any other detached sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| So the two categories that are left coming out of the task force are within 500 feet of an interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| with 40 feet and then everything else is 30 feet for all detached signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| And then there's an associated sign area with those two heights of 220 feet and 195 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| The Washington one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| So you've got many points of reference when it comes to decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| Ultimately, the planning commission will prepare a draft that may be different than what the task force has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1415)|
| 0:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| And that's something yet to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Yeah, what we're trying to do right now is to really get the input from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Let me recognize Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| This light's on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| I just wanted to follow up with Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| So the process you're going through with MPC will go through the commission and then come to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| Yes, because the zoning ordinance is a part of or the sign code is a part of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| and before city council can amend any portion of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| they need a recommendation from the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| So we'll start with what the task force has prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| The planning commission will look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| And perhaps propose alternatives in several areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| And you will be presented with all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Well, then, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Will it be presented in this same format?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| We can continue, yeah, both the side-by-side and the clean copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| Well, I like side-by-side so I can see where we are moving from and what we're moving to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| or at least what the proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| And when might that be available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| Depending on direction received this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| And certainly in my mind, I would like to see the task force come together at least one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| We can shake them into a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| There have been, well, this is the second workshop that we've had since the last meeting of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| There have been several worthy changes that I've taken note of that I'd like to get in front of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1518)|
| 0:25:27| So it might be a couple of months before it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| Well, just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| When we are given copies of this, it sure would be nice to have a date on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| so I would know kind of the sequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| Nothing I have has dates on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| The side-by-side probably doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| It was December, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| I think it was December 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| So this is the most recent one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Thanks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Yeah, one of the things that we hope comes out of this evening's discussion is that some of the ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| and concerns that Council has, and this is an opportunity for us to discuss it openly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| whereas we can't do it privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| So Sign Heights, of course, is one of the things that has been of great interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| This is what started the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| So we really would like, the signed task force would really like to hear what Council has to say based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| where we are at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| As Mark says, there's still going to be plenty of time for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| there will be at least three opportunities for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| The signed task force may also have another as we get the next draft done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| So, again, we're interested to hear what Council has to say, what some of your concerns are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| what some of your constituents may have had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| After listening to that and to what Mark said, Mark, what are other eligible roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| either by example or by type, what's in that category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| Well, that would be anything that's not a federal highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| So we've got several commercial streets that aren't federally designated when you get out to Peter's Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| and Parkside, Cedar Bluff for a while when it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1643)|
| 0:27:34| And what are those, 45 mile an hour roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| Typically the speed is less and they vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| I mean, you can drive as fast as you can, but, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Well, that's the reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| I'm talking about the posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Generally they are posted at a lower speed limit than our main thoroughfares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Yeah, the Kingston Pikes and all those, the Clinton Highways, the ones that are main thoroughfares, some of them U.S. highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| Speed is one of the factors that you want to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| That's where you started, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| And also volume, volume of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Volume of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| On roads that aren't the federally designated highways, the volumes generally are less, so, and the speeds are less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| So you can get by with a smaller sign and still have it readable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| What is the height of a standard telephone pole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| I realize they're not all the same, but, in other words, do you have to be over it, under it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| Does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| I mean, in terms of on the local roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| We had someone that I remember spoke to us at the last workshop about that being a worse obstruction than signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| But in terms of what you see as a planner, I mean, is that a 30-foot sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| What is a pole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| The utility poles are kind of all over the place, and they vary according to their function as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| Some of them are transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Some of them are simply utility lines that are parallel to our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| So there's no real standard there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| I'm sure there is, but I don't know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| About 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| It's between 30 and 35 feet, I think, for utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| And in terms of your original recommendation, am I correct that you were down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| I don't know whether that was council's decision or yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| You were down closer to 15 feet for the local roads, the non-U.S. or federal highway times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| I remember right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| That's where we ended up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| We recommended that we keep the 50 feet at the interchanges of the interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Now we have 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| And then we ratchet down from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| And I think it was something like 30, 20, 15, but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| It might have been 35, 20, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| I'm looking at 50, 35, 20, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| 35, 20, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| So there's that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| But the task force decided they would go 40 as the max, cutting the highest one down, and then 30 for everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| And is that only places where pole signs can be or any place along a road that's within that description can have those signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| In other words, can an office district, an office district that happens to be sitting on whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| Cedar Bluff or one of those roads he mentioned, can they have a 30-foot sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| Well, there's a provision as currently drafted, no, and as currently adopted, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1818)|
| 0:30:27| How about as proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| The task force proposed in office districts that signs be limited to a six-foot monument sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1828)|
| 0:30:43| with 36 square feet of area except for properties that are adjacent to major arterial highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1843)|
| 0:30:52| in which case they could have a 15-foot pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| But we're not there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| We've dropped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Is that another provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| That is a provision that's been proposed by the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| Currently, there is no provision for a 15-foot pole sign in the office zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| But are there monument signs as the limit for those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| In other words, I'm going down a row of, I don't know, doctor's offices and accountants and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| Are they monument signs rather than pole signs, or is there no specific requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| Well, a doctor's office in a commercial zone district could have a 50-foot sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| whereas a doctor's office in an office zone district can only have a six-foot monument sign right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| As of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| As of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| Mr. McGreeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Well, you brought up a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Yeah, I was trying to understand that last piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| So we're not restricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| If it's an extended office area, we're not saying only monument signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| We're not saying that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| We're saying look at the character of the road, and that governs whether you can have a pole sign in probably 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| The proposal from the task force was to allow for a 15-foot pole sign in the office zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| if the property is adjacent to a major arterial highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| But there's no 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| They're all 30s, the way he described it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| That's in the commercial and industrial zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Only in the commercial and industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Well, I didn't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| Mr. McGreeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Well, what I was going to say is that some of us have a concern about the 15-foot high signs in the office area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| in terms of the fact that we don't have that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| We just have monument signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| So on the one hand, we're trying to get some kind of balance, but on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| we have to watch how it works because it ends up that we have the potential of getting some sign clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| in some areas whereas it's not in others like what you brought up, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| And so we have to watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| So the height, the whole height situation with signs is not really just sort of cut and dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1978)|
| 0:33:07| I mean, you have to look at not only are we looking at the roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| but then you get into each one of the zones and take a look also in terms of what's allowed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| So it does become complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| But we're talking commercial and industrial when we look at that Section B that you just went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| B in the agenda, the different roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Yes, sign heights by districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| Those districts are only commercial and industrial, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| No, when we talk about sign heights by districts there, what we're calling those are district roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| You don't care what the zone is then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| You're saying the zone is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| That's the way it is, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| I'm sorry, Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| I don't like it, but I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Yes, I guess I'm confused with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| I mean, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I don't know the groundswell of support for all of a sudden in the office zoning for the signage when we have monuments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| I mean, what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Is there a compromise there that I don't see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| I mean, just walk me through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| I'm just confused with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| I can give you some history on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Currently in the office zone districts, signs that are attached to the building are limited to two square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2068)|
| 0:34:39| The one just screwed to the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Or on a canopy or projecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| And detached signs are limited to six feet in height and 36 square feet in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2086)|
| 0:34:54| It is the most varied dimensional requirement in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| And we quite often, well, we have on occasion rezoned property for the sole purpose of allowing a bigger sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2102)|
| 0:35:15| And I have had people who have business operations in an office zoning on a major arterial ask if they could have a taller sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2115)|
| 0:35:25| We did that on Magnolia just a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| For the dialysis clinic, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Dialysis clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| They put it on the wall, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| They mounted it on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| If you'll recall when Fort Sanders Hospital did a major remodeling, closed the street, added square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2133)|
| 0:35:42| they redid their sign package on the whole complex at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| They had to get a variance for every sign that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| Because the current office dimensional standards are so small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| Two square feet for wall signs and, you know, a six-foot monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| They just felt that it couldn't, those dimensions did not meet the needs that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| So it is the most varied set of sign regulations that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| So I think it warrants a re-look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| So we have, we've recommended through the task force that wall sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| attached signs be limited to five percent of the wall area that's facing roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| And that the detached signs be the same with the exception of this one provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| that in the event that the office district is on a major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| they would be allowed what I would call a small pole sign as a detached sign up to 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2204)|
| 0:36:54| It just seems like that's the exception rather than the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| I remember my time on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| I don't remember a whole lot of that ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| I know it comes about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| But generally, I mean, I'm trying to visualize what's in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| And, you know, I visualize my dentist's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| I mean, I don't, you know, generally go out looking for those type of businesses just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| and the sign grabs you and pulls you in, lures you in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| I mean, generally those businesses are insurance companies, attorneys, dentists, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| a whole array of people like that that you're --it's a whole other marketing aspect of it in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| It just seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| You're just not passers-by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| You're going to the dentist or the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I mean, that's just my, you know, you're asking for opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Yeah, that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| We want you all to chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| That's real confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Not confusing, but I mean, I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| So we have a lot of banks in the 01 zone district as well as medical facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| In the 02 district, it's labeled the civic and institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| We are sitting in an 02 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Every sign on the city county building violated the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| Leading by example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| It was us, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| It was not the Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| Just one dovetail in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| I think that's what we're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| You know, I think that's an oversight to say you can have a 15-foot pole sign in an 01 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| I mean, I think that's something that needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| So we're giving him this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| He goes back to MPC with that, you know, and then come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| So that's something that hopefully he would correct there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| But I think there could be a distinction, certainly, if that 01 or if that office existed on a major arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| In my mind, that's a little different than on Sutherland Avenue, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| or in an office zone in an office park or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| So there's where it gets a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| The 5 percent, I don't know how to translate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| Do any of the signs on the city county building meet the 5 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| Well, they'd be considerably less than 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Oh, they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| It's peaceful signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| I can't visualize 5 percent of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| The old test was two square feet, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| So 5 percent would be if you had a 20-foot tall building and the top one foot was a continuous sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| That would be 5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| So if I could then, do you care if I maybe jump ahead just a little bit in the agenda here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2372)|
| 0:39:42| I mean, while we're on that, it just seems like to me if we're going to do it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| you've got zoning and you've got exceptions to zoning, and then you've got enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| and then you've got confusion, and then you've got people calling us with e-mails and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| And I feel like one of them don't buy cable commercials right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| But it just seems like that we're creating a nightmare for our codes enforcement people to be able to go out and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2403)|
| 0:40:15| And maybe I'm, you know, not giving them enough credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| but it just seems like that it would be very confusing to the business community, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| and I think it will be very confusing to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| You're talking about the 01 situation, not the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| That's what we want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| I mean, just more, I guess I'm pleading the case here, but it just kind of how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| And we will be getting input from codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| We've already been getting input from codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| We'll also be getting input from the legal department in terms of what's going to be allowed also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| Can you share that with us, or is it premature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Premature on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| But you did bring up one point that we do have on the agenda here, and that does have to do with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| And part of that enforcement has to do with not only the signs that are being requested and the new signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| but this could also dovetail into we had quite a lengthy discussion on abandoned signs and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| And that's been, it was interesting, probably, it was about our second or third meeting, I guess, when it was at Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| We did the tour around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| And I would say that everybody, all members of the committee of the task force, that when we got back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| that was one thing that we all kind of said, hey, wait a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| we really do have a lot of abandoned signs and a lot of signs that are just sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| And, you know, what should we do about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| And so that's been an issue that's been brought up by both business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| as well as neighborhoods in scenic Knoxville on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| And the question there is that if there is a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| and the tenants leave, to what extent or to how long do you allow that sign to remain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| That's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| The other issue that I see is if you go down, if you go down any of our major streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| and I'm thinking of Broadway in particular, there are a lot of, I shouldn't say a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| there are some areas where there's just a pole sticking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| Are there some areas where there's a double pole with a box that the fluorescent lights are showing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| You know, in other words, it's not, there's even some signs, poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| Yeah, there's even poles, pole signs on vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| I mean, where there is no building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| So I think there's two distinctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| George, you and I talked about this a little bit, too, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| in terms of it's one thing to have a building and have a sign and the person leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| How long should that, you know, be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| Or how long should the sign stay up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Or where you have what I was talking about just earlier in terms of the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| and sign posts and bases that are sitting there that are really, really eyesores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| You might want to jump in on that, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Well, if I understand it right, the pole and the footer is the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| And the box up top, you know, is easily removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| I think, Mark, we've got it where they have to, if the owner of the business leaves the premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| they have 60 days to take that down, 60 days, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| Or to encase it in some sort of sheathing that presents a better-looking structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2593)|
| 0:43:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| So recently you've had, on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| he had Applebee's close right there at Wesley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| When they closed that, they immediately took their box off their pole sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| because they don't want their name affiliated with a vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| And it came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| The sign, the sign structure is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| But the box is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| And I've talked to a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| We had someone come last time to the public forum and express a concern over 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| It's too tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| And maybe it should be longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| You know, make it longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| What should it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| It should be 90 days or 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| But there should be a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| There's no time limit now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| I mean, it's better if it's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Well, is that a issue comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Well, what's the burden on the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| Well, you know, some people want it down, and you need to make an ordinance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| Some people will never take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| We've got signs on that business hasn't been there for, you know, for a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| I mean, there's some ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| But you've got to have some standard, and you have to be able to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| It's not a major cost to have that sign taken down or a blank sign, you know, put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| But, you know, again, you're back to what was our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| And our goal was to create less clutter, less site clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| And that's, you know, bring an ordinance that would do that and fit the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| So I don't think it's unrealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| We looked at other cities that have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| And other cities, it's reasonable to ask them when you vacate the building, you take the sign down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| And I don't think it's a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Now, what happens is the tenant, here's the downside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| The tenant goes out of business, has no money, and leaves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| And now it's the expense of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| But so is cutting the grass and trimming the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| I mean, you know, it's just another expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| You put the burden on the owner to take that sign down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| And there's some, you know, there's some complaint about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| But the sign itself and the pole and all that's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| We're talking about taking the box down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Is the pole itself generally owned by the person who owns the property, not the business leasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| So, Councilman Sommers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| This does bring up the question that I don't recall seeing being discussed anywhere, and that is fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| On the front end, especially when we start talking about enforcement there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| there's obviously a cost to the city involved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| Did you all discuss fees and perhaps changing them, maybe even making them bigger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| Well, you're still in a complaint-driven world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| And it's still going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| I don't think anybody's envisioned that we're going to hire a bunch of sign cops out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| and run up and down and, you know, start looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I mean, it's still a complaint-driven world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Somebody calls in and says, hey, that sign's been up for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| and it's got graffiti on it, you know, make the move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| And right now, your language is, according to the legal department, is very vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| It's too vague to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| So we tried to come up with language that was enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| but not with the intention of sending out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| But fees and stuff, I mean, I think that's back to the department, not the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| I don't have a light, so I'm at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| We'll call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| You've got the conch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Mr. Donaldson, so under the scenario of Applebee's that closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| and so if you take down the box, but the pole stays there, that where you can come back and put what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2815)|
| 0:47:06| Is that grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| The proposed language would require that the owner of the property either paint the sign area over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2833)|
| 0:47:23| or reverse the sign face if it has a cabinet or put a temporary covering over the cabinet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2843)|
| 0:47:35| I understand that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| But the new business that comes in there, George's and Dwayne's Hamburger Shack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| they can go right back with the same sign that was there prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Yeah, I was just wondering, is there any reason why we couldn't do this like we do all of the neighborhood codes violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2870)|
| 0:47:59| In other words, George said it's complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| Someone says there's an abandoned sign on X road at the old building 1221 something or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| And our codes people then send them that certified letter saying you've got 30 days from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| or 60 days from now to take it down or we'll have it done and put a lien on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| That seems cleaner than what George was worried about, that we start getting pools of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| and this, that, and the other and permissions to put up a sign so we can take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| I would think the landlord could have that as part of his, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| first month or two month hold back or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| You must remove sign he puts in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| If the guy doesn't, he takes that part of the deposit and takes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| calls some poll company to come take the box off it and haul it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| So is there any reason why we couldn't do the first part, which is just if the complaint is in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| we go out and inspect, we write the guy a certified letter from, I guess, Tom Reynolds' department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| Scott Elder, somebody, and they turn around and give him enough time to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| But if he doesn't, they do it and they lay a lien on the property or somehow, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| get the tax guy to enforce it downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| Is that open to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| I just don't think you have the language now to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| That's what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| But we could get we have enough lawyers to certainly someone can conjure those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| Lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| I think that's, you know, part of what you're telling Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| We want that new kind of stuff included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| But you've got to have the clear language to say what is an abandoned sign and blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| And that's what we heard from the legal department was you've got to have clear language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| And they prepared that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| So, yeah, the legal department has prepared this section, including a definition for an abandoned sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2983)|
| 0:49:52| So once we get to that point, we inspect it and convince ourselves we're on safe ground as the codes people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| we then give them the formal due process notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| And if they don't do it, we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| And tough nookies, we file a lien, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| Krista, would you, I mean, do you want to weigh in on any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| Or you just, is it premature, you think, for you to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| I don't want to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| I mean, if you want to, you know, if it's premature, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| You need to get your sea legs sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| Mr. Cooker, our law department, I'm relatively new to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| As you all know, Angela left and she was involved in the task force and I think participated in a lot of the drafting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| that you all have been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| I haven't had much of an opportunity to have that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| So I think that it is a bit premature from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3046)|
| 0:50:54| but I definitely would be willing to look at it and review it with Mark and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| if the task force meets again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| I assume since you're here that you'll be kind of spearheading this for the duration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| Councilwoman Palmer, you're done with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| I think we've beat this horse enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| We need to move on to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Yes, another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Another issue that came up with both parties, you might say, are window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| To what degree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| How many window signs and whether or not you begin to regulate window signs and what percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| I believe we said, what, 20 percent, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| Or 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| You want to tell us what a window sign is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| What is or isn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| A window sign is where, in your storefront, you, on the inside, you put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| Talk into the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| A Marlboro sign or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| You know, suits, two for $99.99 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| It's on the inside of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Oh, yes, facing out is what they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| Anything, any type of advertisement hanging on the inside of the building facing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| And you don't care whether it's neon, a TV set, paper sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| It's a sign in the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Facing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| We had definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| And so you said 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| You want to elaborate on the 20 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Let me try to fill you in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| Currently, we really don't regulate window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| People put them up without getting permits, and they go unchecked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| Except in two of the relatively new zone districts, the town center one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| and the traditional neighborhood development one, window signs aren't addressed at all in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3173)|
| 0:53:02| In the T&D one and TC one, I think it calls out allowing window signs up to 30 percent of the window area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3182)|
| 0:53:12| The task force recommended that we exempt window signs from permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| if they do not exceed 25 percent of the area of the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| If they exceeded that, then they would be included in the area determination for attached signs and would need a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3205)|
| 0:53:36| So we're tepidly putting our foot in the water of regulating window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| And we do say a window sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Let me give you the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| A type of attached sign placed within a window facing the street or thoroughfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| including a television or monitor placed in a window to the purpose of advertising product, services, or business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| It may be composed of applied letters, symbols, neon, or similar lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| but may not obscure the view of the interior of the building is the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| Then, presumably, they could have some window signs of whatever percentage of the window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| and a sign on the side of their building of five percent or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| So, I mean, would that count as part of the five percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| If it exceeded 25 percent of the area of the window, it would then become part of the calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3263)|
| 0:54:31| But, I mean, is that the five percent plus the 25 percent of the window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Well, in a commercial district, it's actually 10 percent of the wall area facing a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| If they kept all of their window signs at less than 25 percent, they would not require a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| and it would not be a part of the calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| So, right now, all of them are not a part of the calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3293)|
| 0:55:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| I don't know if we have Mr. Brennahan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| I see Tom here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Can someone tell us if they have enforcement issues with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| This must be a million windows you've got to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| That sounds like a lot of windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Again, it would be complaint driven, I guess, but I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| Well, he just said we don't have a provision for it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| No, but I'm saying, if we make one, are we still making a nightmare for them is my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| or is that something they can deal with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| And I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Someone sent me a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| It might have been Ms. Feld or something of some store on Cedar Bluff or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| Where was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| I'm thinking, gosh, there could be a hundred of those stores out there or more that are going to call for attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Tom, do you know if you could enforce that in terms of manpower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Let me connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| No, let me expand on that, too, while Tom makes his way down here, I assume, if he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| But, I mean, there's going to have to be a time to where, I mean, I keep hearing complaint driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| but we're creating a whole new world right here with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| And, you know, where is the administration on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| Are we willing to budget for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| Because it's going to be more than complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| Once this becomes gospel, then, you know, I see a kaboom coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| And then I'm not willing to pass something that we can't enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| I'm just going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Well, that's why I'm asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Is it we're making a nightmare or can we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Let me say before Tom speaks is one of the things that we have been doing is talking to the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| and seeing whether or not the administration is going to back what this is also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| which means to be able to enforce it, which means if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| are they going to be able to hire people in order to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| So they're in the loop in terms of discussions about this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| And I understand what you're saying, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| So when will they be, you know, at what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| I'd like to know his name, rank, and serial number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| At what point then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| I mean, we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| I mean, I need some type of verification from the administration that they're behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| and that they're willing to have, you know, put in the budget the enforcement portion of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| because I understand it's complaint driven now, but it's what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| and particularly this one in particular really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| You know, how are you going to measure a building, you know, five percent of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| You've got awnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| I mean, I can just see a lot of enforcement problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| Again, that's why we're having these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| So let's hear from Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Tom Reynolds, deputy director, bill inspection plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| Well, of course, I always have concerns about staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| and being able to respond to complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| And our department is complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| I think that adding to we as you all know we have one sign inspector to cover the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3478)|
| 0:58:08| And I think it's a daunting task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| We try to sometimes spread that responsibility across to some of our other inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| But it's a hard goal to achieve, not only with signs, but in other areas of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3500)|
| 0:58:32| So, yes, I'm concerned with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| I would like to have more staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| but that decision would come from the administration different, you know, higher up than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| If it's appropriate, I wanted to call on Ms. Joyce Feld about the window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| If you want to come and address us about the window signs and your perspective on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3533)|
| 0:59:02| I just think it's important to regulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| I think that it, you know, as I said in my e-mail today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| and I don't know how many of you got a chance to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| but window signs are taking advantage of the public right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| And, you know, they're not facing inward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| They're facing outward so that they're visible from the public right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| and they mar the aesthetics of the public right away, or they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| And I think the photograph I sent you today was a good example of that, of not having any regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| So since they take advantage of the public realm, we, you know, we have a right to regulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| And it's a way to sort of cheat the system, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| You know, we have regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| We limit signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| We limit size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| We limit height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| But then it's not fair for somebody to be able to cheat the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| and go and exceed the limits by putting up a bunch of window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| So I don't think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| And, you know, it doesn't look very good a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| You know, that picture I sent you today, I don't think anybody can justify it and say that it looks very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| So I think they need to be regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| I think it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| We're not saying eliminate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| We're saying regulate them and minimize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| Thank you for your perspective on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| I want to dovetail on to Vice Mayor Pavlis' concern about enforcement and cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| There's no doubt that the work of the task force in addressing the signs is a really needed thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| and I'm very supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| At the same time, I'm concerned about the cost of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| And I don't want this body, I don't want MPC to put in months of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| and the task force has put in months, and then it comes to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| and we pass something that can't be enforced because we don't have the staff or the personnel or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| So I would like to suggest, and I will be asking for a cost analysis when we get the draft from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3657)|
| 1:01:06| that council will be looking at so that we have some idea if there are additional costs to enforcing whatever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| ordinance is that we are finally ready to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| Right now, we're tossing these in the air like balls in a circus or something as we try things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| But when we get down to the nitty-grit before council passes anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| I'm going to be asking for a cost analysis specifically on the enforcement piece so that we don't pass something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| that we can't enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| To me, it's ridiculous to have laws on the books that we can't enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| And I think we need to look at that carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| You're talking about the fiscal note attached to the legislation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| They do it nationally every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| I would ask that, and I don't have a problem with that, Councilman Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| but I would ask that there are pieces and parts of the existing ordinance that we're trying to look at to modify that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3719)|
| 1:02:11| already on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| So what you're asking then is, like, for instance, the window signs, which is not on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| In other words, what that would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| In other words, you're not saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| I mean, right now, we already know that Tom and his staff are short staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Even to take care of the existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| So what I'm asking is that you're not saying that what we already have, if we modify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| you're not concerned about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| You're concerned about that if window signs, for instance, what that's going to cost to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| Well, I'm concerned about what we have now that we can't enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Because we don't have the staff or whatever it takes to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| So we already have things on the books that are not enforced or not equitably enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| That's another piece, too, that as we bring forth a new ordinance that's clean, crisp, everyone understands it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| I think we need to be very clear that it's going to be equitably enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| that pieces of it will be enforced for some and not for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| And I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| Tom's department does a great job with the resources they have in sign enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| There's simply not enough for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| One of the suggestions we got was to use 311 more as if we're going to stay on a complaint-driven path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3808)|
| 1:03:37| 311 could obviously be a vehicle to receive the complaints about the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| and then pass those along and maybe prioritize or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| But I'm just concerned that we have laws on the books now regarding signs that we don't enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| or don't enforce consistently because we just don't have the staff to do that, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| A perfect example is something that we all see as we're driving down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| and in the median is a sign for roof repair, daycare, some other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3845)|
| 1:04:13| Buy houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| We buy houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| A furniture company was going out of business for about five months every weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| And those signs would show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| And they would wait until Friday afternoon until the enforcement folks were gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| They put the signs out, and then they would pick them up Sunday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| Well, this is as much clutter as anything else we have in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| So I'm just really concerned that we not as we move forward and adopt the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| and I think there's some healthy ideas here, that we don't find ourselves a year or two, three from now saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3884)|
| 1:04:53| gosh, you know, we can't really enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| Well, but I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Well, I just want to make sure as far as the task force is concerned is that we have an existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3900)|
| 1:05:07| And some of it is enforced and some of it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| It's complaint driven the way a number of things in the city are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| And so what I'm saying is that the task force is making some recommendations that there's modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| to the existing, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| And so what I want to be sure is that we're not saying that because we may not have the enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3926)|
| 1:05:33| we won't do anything, we'll just keep what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| That's not what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| What you're saying is that if it's a brand-new issue that you'd like to know what the cost would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| and whether or not we have the support of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| I just want to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| And as the ordinance comes out of MPC and comes to us, and we get this cost analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| we may decide that there are parts that we don't include at this time or we come out with some other strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3950)|
| 1:05:59| rather than have it on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| And, you know, Dwayne's Liquor Store has 500 signs for different kinds of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| Mark Donaldson's Wine Store has 500 signs for different kinds of wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| And, you know, but we can't we don't include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| So I just want to be sure we are real clear of where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| Well, it also brings up the fact that when this goes into effect, which is another issue to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| Let me move on here with Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| I need to correct a statement that I made previously about window signs is that so right now as proposed by the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3989)|
| 1:06:37| window signs are prohibited unless they are less than 25 percent of the window area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| in which case they don't require a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| So under that scenario, you could argue that there would be less enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| and it's much clearer than the current not addressing it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| No window signs unless it's bigger than?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Unless it's smaller than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| So if you have a window with 100 square feet, you can have up to 25 square feet of that window without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4024)|
| 1:07:12| If you go, you can't have anything beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| It's an absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Let me recognize Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| He has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Well, I'm going to also say that even though we have language in there now about abandoned signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| but we don't have language in there that's enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| And so what we're trying to do is we're not changing the category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| We're just saying we're trying to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| This is we spent meeting after meeting on the intricacies of that language to say we want language that says all we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4060)|
| 1:07:48| is enforce what they know that we can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| You know, we can move as Councilman Delvaux offered to say we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| That's what we're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| So it's not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| It's just that we can't enforce it now because it's we don't have the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| We don't feel like we have enough clear language, you know, to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| The other thing is the temporary signs that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Those are illegal now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| They're illegal and they're proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| They'll always be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| The removal then, you know, becomes either the public can remove it, anyone can remove those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| It's not, you know, they don't have to call Tom Reynolds and say, hey, these signs out here are illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| But there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| But as we spent hours talking about, they're hanging on a utility pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| We don't necessarily have the authority to go take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Nor do we have the authority to cite those, even the phone numbers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| I mean, we spent a lot of time talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| It's not worth repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| But the problem is a lot of that stuff, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| And it's really almost unless somebody just takes it down, it's really not much more you can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| But anyway, they're illegal now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| They'll be illegal in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| But that doesn't keep people from putting them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| I don't want to belabor a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| I'm going to a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| I still think there's a big issue about funding here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| And I want everybody to understand this because I just got through hearing from Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| They're understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| They don't have the ability to go out and enforce what is already on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| So, I mean, it was kind of jumped over that, well, that really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| Well, it does matter because we've all had those emails and calls from people like, it's on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| Why don't you enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| In the public, the taxpayers don't want to hear, well, we don't have the money or, you know, we just can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| That's not an acceptable answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| So I very strongly suggest that that is bundled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| You know, this is the time, then, to bundle that into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| You know, if we're going to enforce it, then let's get the tools out there to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| So just because it's a preexisting problem doesn't mean that it should be overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4196)|
| 1:10:03| And there again, you know, you're talking about expanding a lot of budgets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| So, I mean, that's going to be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Councilman Wallace, you mentioned utility poles and signs that are illegally placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| Both state law and city ordinance prohibit anything being attached to utility poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| That includes city street signs, bus stop signs, and other kinds of traffic monitoring signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| because that becomes a hazard when the utility company needs to get up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| The past few days, as cold as it's been, I'm sure most of us are quite pleased that we've had power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| and that we've not had an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| But I think that we need to remember that that's a pretty simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| And I know that, you know, you say that, well, it's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| At one time, there was a person who was in the codes enforcement on the weekends who would go around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| and he would take down the yard sale signs, the other things that were attached to poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| And he had a long rake in the back of his pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| And he removed all those, and he cleaned different sections of the city every week or every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| And, you know, that obviously was a visual improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| But as you say, it's not always easy to break old habits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4281)|
| 1:11:21| And I think do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| I mean, I've got a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| I think we could put a bounty on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| and then these guys could collect five bucks for every sign they bring in or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| But Councilman Grieve, let's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Well, I just want to say that the task force also wrestled with the whole idea of enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| and the conversations that I've had with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| And I think it's imperative if this council really believes in what we're trying to do with the signed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4304)|
| 1:11:52| and coming up with regulations that we feel are important to have a clutter-free city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4312)|
| 1:12:01| to have a more beautiful city, if we actually believe in these purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| it's really up to this council to let the mayor know and the administration know that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| this is an important item and that, therefore, you know, it does need to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| It is going to cost some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Maybe we do want to step aside from being, instead of complaint-driven, that we want some enforcement done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| And so it's going to be the responsibility if each of us believe in what has been put together over the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| and believe in this signed ordinance and the changes that are most likely going to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| that we need to address the mayor and the administration and let them know that we do need more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| So I'll put that out to my fellow colleagues on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| I think the last thing that we have here is landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| Let me ask you, are we going to talk about sign area as opposed to height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| In other words, how big can the face of a sign be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Are we going to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4378)|
| 1:13:07| Well, currently, within the ordinance, there are a variety of maximum allowed sign areas for detached signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4387)|
| 1:13:17| ranging from 195 square feet in the neighborhood commercial district to upwards to 400 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4397)|
| 1:13:28| under certain circumstances for a directory sign in a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| Generally, the task force ratcheted down the sign area in the same percentages that the sign heights were diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4416)|
| 1:13:47| Portionally, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| Right, so that basically the old commercial maximum was about 275 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4428)|
| 1:13:56| so the base then was reduced to 195 square feet with signs near the interchanges allowed to be up to 220 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4436)|
| 1:14:07| Generally, that's a scheme that most cities have, that there is a relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4447)|
| 1:14:16| The sign area follows the same relationship that the sign height does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| and some cities go as far as requiring that sign texts, the size of individual letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4460)|
| 1:14:28| be proportional to the sign height and the sign area as well for readability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| We haven't gone that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| So it's the simple answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| We have a reduction, but it's proportional to the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| Yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| Thank you, Mr. Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| I mean, I just, I mean, I was just, I guess, just moving into open discussion in terms of trying to get feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4491)|
| 1:14:58| I think, you know, to me this sort of comes back to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| the experience I've had with it was the whole Chick-fil-A episode in Bearden and in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4502)|
| 1:15:10| and I think the result of that experience has made me that we need, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| we need to take a look at our sign ordinance because I think we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| at least I personally think that the community is happier with signs more like the Chick-fil-A sign in Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| versus the Chick-fil-A sign in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| I think the Fountain City is 40 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| And so in terms of, you know, my look at what's come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| I think we can do much better than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| I think we can go much lower than the recommendations in the sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| You know, I think, again, you know, my opinion, and, again, it's, you know, to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| talked about amongst the nine of us more like the scenic Knoxville or at least what was passed in November of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4553)|
| 1:16:01| I think those are the big, I think that's probably the biggest issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| and I think that's also where this change of this ordinance will have the biggest impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| And I think I certainly feel, I think we all feel frustrated about the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| But on that issue, you know, I think most business owners, you know, follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| And so when they go to apply for a permit, you know, they ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| And so I think there won't be too much of an enforcement issue with that part of the change we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4583)|
| 1:16:31| So those are my comments on those factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| I haven't really sunk my teeth into the challenge of the window signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| but I think, you know, it does add a challenge to enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| But, again, having that tool in your toolbox for a place that is really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| detracts from our community and the way it looks, I think it's a plus to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| and at least you have the potential to change that behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| But those are my thoughts, and I just wanted to share them with the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Yeah, I would second what Marshall said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| I do really appreciate the work the task force has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| It's really incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| If we, I think you've heard some of our concerns, our questions, our curiosity, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| And if you're going to meet again, I assume some of this will be incorporated into actions that you propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| But I think this is a task well worth doing, and I have to applaud the task force for the work they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| I know it hasn't been easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| I went to several of the meetings and listened to some of the discussion and kept up with it, but I applaud you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4661)|
| 1:17:48| Will we get it all done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| And that's okay with me, but I think we will make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| Chairman Greene, can we get a summary, you think, of what the next steps would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| Did you want to talk about landscaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| Oh, well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| I guess we better, hadn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| You want to discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| What we were basically talking about in terms of what we were looking at is to have some type of requirement for landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4691)|
| 1:18:18| around the signs on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| And there's been some discussion about what that is and to what extent there is for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| We also talked about, as far as the pole signs go, in terms of having some kind of either rectangular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| or square enclosure instead of just a round pole on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| We refer to the pole signs as popsicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| But the landscaping was not really, I don't think it was really a contentious type of thing that talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4723)|
| 1:18:50| but it was brought up by both groups in terms of the importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| So I would recommend that council take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| Where this goes is that the assigned task force has the opportunity to meet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| and review not only what council has said, but also some of the issues that we really didn't get fully aired with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4742)|
| 1:19:10| And from there, whether or not we have a public forum or not, it does go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| MPC staff puts it together and makes their recommendation to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| At MPC, that will be another time for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| They just review it once, right, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| Well, we'll review it as many times as it takes to get a recommendation, but usually that's only once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| The MPC will then recommend it to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Council will have two readings of which, again, at that particular time, there will be a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| Let me kind of close with an --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| So let me kind of give you the history of what happened on the poll signs in terms of the heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4790)|
| 1:19:58| And basically what we have on what the task force finally voted on, which was at the 6-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| as compared to what city council voted two years ago on first reading, is that it was really a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4804)|
| 1:20:12| There were folks on the task force who didn't really want to reduce the sign height at all from 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| There were also folks that would like to keep it at 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| There were folks that wanted to keep it at 35 feet, and some wanted to keep it at 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| And so basically what happened after really some dialogue going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| it was a compromise that was reached at the 30 feet for the signs except for the ones right at the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| which was reduced to 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| I think I brought this up the last time, and am I happy with 30 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| Not particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Are the people that wanted 35 feet, are they happy with 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| But I think that, again, it goes back to what I was saying in the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| that one of the things that I personally was looking for is a balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| and looking for a balance of something that all of us could live with at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| Also, I think that it was interesting in looking at sign permits for the last 12 years or 13 years that 70% no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4868)|
| 1:21:19| it was 77% of the sign permits were for signs 25 feet and less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| It was really kind of amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| In fact, I'll get for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| I'm now going through the 2013 signs, and I'll have that information for council to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| I also think it's kind of interesting that the folks that I've dealt with, Chick-fil-A, Kroger's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4894)|
| 1:21:43| other businesses where they knew that they could come in and get a 50-foot sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| but they were willing to talk to us, and they have much lower signs, 25 feet less signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4908)|
| 1:21:57| It's also been proven that when you're driving down the road that a sign ought to be a certain height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| if you really want to see it from a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| So there's a lot of give and takes, and it also has to do with the cost of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| So, again, the sign task force with what we've come up with is a real compromise between really the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| and well, it's really a compromise for the business community more so than it is for the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| or scenic Knoxville, which would like to have it even less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| So that's where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| It was an actual compromise on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| I think that one of the things that I also am concerned about is that I don't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| I personally do not want to see two years' worth of work go down the drain because of a five-foot difference in a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| Now, some people will argue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| And having been president of scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| I know how important it is to do away with the clutter and do away with abandoned signs and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| And I think we have an opportunity with the ordinance that we're trying to put together now that's far better than what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| Is it the best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| Not necessarily, but at least it's, again, I go back to the word, it's a balance of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| I do think, Vice Mayor, that we do have to get the administration on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| As far as what Council Lady Palmer was talking about in terms of new issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| we do need to look at those and see what we're talking about in terms of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| It goes back, again, to what I said earlier, that if we really believe in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| and if we really want this to happen and if we really want our city to look better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| then we've got to have the enforcement to go along with it and we've got to be able to invest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| And I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| So that's a little bit of the history in terms of how we got to the size of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| I think we're going to take into consideration what Council has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| I know Mark is going to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| And the signed task force will meet again and we'll see what we come up with on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| So thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| I just wanted to thank the signed task force for all this time and effort they put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| and the chairman and the vice chairman for all the work that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| And hopefully, as we move forward, we can do some out-of-the-box thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| to try to come up with a policy that will be equitable to businesses and the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5051)|
| 1:24:19| that we'll have a kind of city that we'll be proud of as we go into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| But mainly, I just want to thank the signed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| They've really been working on this for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Yeah, of course, I think everyone here would second what Dan just said about thanking you for putting in the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| and effort and hearing all the disparate views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| A thought hit me, and that was when Dwayne was saying that when you did a ten-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| or a seven-year, I forget the number of year, review of sign permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| that 75 or 70 percent were 25 feet in height or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| Is it possible for us to have a two-tier provision that says pick a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| and I don't care whether it's 30 feet, 20 feet, 25 feet, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| let's say that signs shall ordinarily be X height or limited to X height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| and then the stop gap, the safety valve is if you can show special conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| about landscape speed, this, that, or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| you can ask for permission to have a sign up to the next tier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| In other words, let's say everyone gets maximum of 20 or 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| If you need 30 or 35, some other number, if you can show these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| you can ask for it, and it will be reviewed independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| You make it easy to get the lower sign, and you make a process for getting a higher sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| I don't know if you can do that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| but maybe that would make the enforcement guys just crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| But it would deal for the special situations where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| one rule is not fair for everyone kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Maybe we already have that in terms of a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| Maybe that's all we have is you apply for a bigger sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| and if you can show you have a variance need, you get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| But that thought of lowering the bar a tad, then making it a fair channel if you want to go for extra height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5166)|
| 1:26:16| because you've got a special situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| We'll let you chair that panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| It will be a busy panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Only 30 percent of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Let's conclude with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| Well, I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| There was discussion about if you kind of what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| If you will reduce the sign height, we'll give you a bonus on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| So there was some discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| And some of it does have merit that instead of if it's maximum of 30, you take it at 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5202)|
| 1:26:50| but you get more sign on the base of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| I see a tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| And that didn't make it in this proposal, but it does have merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| I just want to say one more thing is that if any of the council members have additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| that you want to share with us, you know, please, you know, go ahead and send it to Cindy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| and she'll send it to the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| And the other question is that we can continue once we get feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| If you folks are interested, we'll send you that information like we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| I don't know how much you're interested in, but we can do that because we're still getting feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| from different individuals, and we'll be glad to share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| No further laps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| If there's no further business, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140130?start=5253)|
