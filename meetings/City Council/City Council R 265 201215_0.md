| 0:03:53| Any items to be added by motion. Okay. Are there items on consent? And if so, are there any items on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=233)|
| 0:04:02| I don't think no, ma'am. I need a motion on that. We can move back to the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| Okay, it's good to see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| 1st, the statement I've been sharing the last few months as allowed by governor executive orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| In response to the pandemic, unless I hear objection, I'm going to rule that by acclamation. Council agrees that this meeting is being conducted electronically in order to protect the public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=260)|
| 0:04:33| All right, seeing no objections, let's move forward to the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| So, believe it or not tonight is our last city council meeting of 2020 and what a year it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=276)|
| 0:04:45| I just want to say in public and in front of all of you, even though it's not in person, I'm really, really grateful for all of council's hard work this year. Your perseverance, your commitment to serving the people of Knoxville, especially during this exceptionally challenging year has been tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=285)|
| 0:05:02| And I really appreciate your partnership and hard work and adaptability. So, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| As, you know, part of this difficult year has been our pandemic that we've been experiencing along with people around the globe right here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=309)|
| 0:05:20| Over 24,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus. As of today, 223 residents of our county have died of this disease. And there are another 122 residents in the hospital right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=320)|
| 0:05:34| We've had a record number of cases in recent weeks and a record number just in the last few days. And these are somber reminders of the toll the pandemic is having in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=334)|
| 0:05:45| We're experiencing a surge right now to post Thanksgiving surge, and so I encourage you all to use your platforms to continue to encourage people to avoid crowded places and practice the five core actions and all the things that we've been encouraging all along, but now more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=345)|
| 0:06:02| So, let's keep all those battling this ugly virus in our thoughts, and let's remember that we can all play a role in slowing this current spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| So, I'm also on a happier note, really proud of how resilient Knoxville has been in this last year across our community leaders have risen to the challenges in front of them. And Knoxville is no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=369)|
| 0:06:24| The city of Knoxville has been able to keep all of our services intact. We avoided furloughs and layoffs, and we kept our doors open to serve our residents and local businesses. At the same time, we've been responding to people in need in our community, and we collectively face this pandemic by helping families make rent and mortgage payments, providing shelter and services to those experiencing homelessness, investing in job training, supporting local nonprofits, and so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=384)|
| 0:06:53| We also managed to accomplish a lot to advance our priorities that are our priorities pre-pandemic and still continue to be our priorities even in the middle of the pandemic, and those are public safety, healthy and connected neighborhoods, a clean and resilient future, thriving businesses and good jobs, and good governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=413)|
| 0:07:11| I want to share a few of the highlights because sometimes it's easy to focus on some of the challenges we face, but I want to highlight at the end of this year some of the many good things that we've accomplished together. We've invested another $7.5 million in affordable housing. We started an HR department. We funded and are starting to put in the field body cameras for our Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=431)|
| 0:07:37| We are committed to rethinking public safety. We revised the Code of Conduct for KPD and the use of force policy, and we launched a new co-response team pilot. We launched and have attended and participated in the Mayor's Climate Council to chart a path toward achieving our sustainability goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=457)|
| 0:07:55| We're moving forward on the Urban Wilderness Plan and exciting new amenities. We made improvements on a number of parks across our city, Count Johnson, Danny Mayfield, Paul Hogue, and many more. We repaved almost 40 miles of roads in the city of Knoxville, completed multiple traffic calming upgrades to keep neighborhoods safe, improved how residents can request city services, launched the chat bot, and we are soon to launch a new 311 online tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=475)|
| 0:08:21| So I could go on, and I'm really proud of the team that's been working on this, but we also have a long agenda, so I just want to thank you all for pushing through and working hard during possibly the most difficult year in modern history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=501)|
| 0:08:35| So just on that note, one thing I'm also proud of is this Council has always been able to have healthy dialogue, and I want to just encourage that to continue tonight. I think it's vital that we do have a lot more common ground than not, both as a Council and as a city and as a broader community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=515)|
| 0:08:53| So before we move on to the rest of our agenda, I want to encourage everyone, we have a lot of people signed up to speak both during public forum and to particular agenda items. So I want to encourage everyone to maintain civility in the quorum throughout the meeting. We have a long agenda, and everyone deserves equal respect. Personal attacks and profanity will not be allowed. So that's it for my mayor's report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=533)|
| 0:09:15| And without further ado, we'll go on to reports of Councilmembers to our committee. Any reports from Councilmembers? Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| Yes, thanks largely to the efforts of Legacy Parks. The city residents of Knoxville have 42 more acres of green space and wilderness to enjoy. This is up in North Knoxville. It's on the north side of Sharks Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=563)|
| 0:09:39| It includes about two miles of trails, playground equipment, and also it's configured in such a way that it's suitable for people of all abilities and all ages. We had a nice ribbon cutting about two weeks ago. The mayor was there. Several of my colleagues were able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=579)|
| 0:09:59| And so I just would invite everyone to enjoy this. And the address is at 3750 Tiberias Road. And it's a blessing in one way that we have so much outdoors during this time because it is a way that we can remain healthy and stay safe at the same time during this tough period we're going through. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=599)|
| 0:10:29| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas. Councilmember Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| Yeah, just to clarify, because at the last meeting I had a different date. The Audit Committee has changed its meeting date due to the increase of COVID and the Board of Health's order to have meetings no more of 10 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=633)|
| 0:10:48| The Audit Committee is going to meet on Tuesday, December 22nd at 2.45 p.m. It will be airing on CTV and it will be a Zoom meeting following the same orders that allow us to meet here via Zoom. This is a meeting that we have to have prior to the end of the fiscal year, or sorry, the calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=648)|
| 0:11:09| So again, that's Tuesday, December 22nd, 2.45 p.m. One other thing I wanted to highlight, I know there are a lot of nonprofits that are hurting due to COVID. And so number one, I'd just like to encourage everyone to donate to those and maybe consider that in lieu of other things you might give or in honor of family members or in honor of friends or family that are no longer with you to kind of highlight some of the things that are hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=669)|
| 0:11:39| There are a lot of nonprofits that might be missing funds at this time in 2020, as challenging as it's been. And specifically, I want to point out one successful initiative that got started that's on the Office of Neighborhoods website. A member of the Neighborhood Advisory Council, Morgan Wilson, initiated the idea to have a virtual food drive and it's been incredibly successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=699)|
| 0:12:04| So if you want to contribute, it's virtual. So you just go to the website, and you can find that on the Office of Neighborhoods website for the city of Knoxville and contribute to that. And I just appreciate everyone doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=724)|
| 0:12:24| I just want to make a quick announcement that tomorrow at 3.30, streaming on the Knox County's website will be live streamed. So if you want to participate, you can go to the Office of Neighborhoods website for the city of Knoxville and contribute to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=744)|
| 0:12:48| So tomorrow at 3.30, streaming on the Knox County's website will be a legislative joint meeting hosted by Senator Briggs, Knox County Commissioner Chair, Larson Jane Farragut, Vice Mayor Pavlin, and myself, along with Knoxville Hospital Partners from Children's Hospital to NOVA, Covenant, and UT Hospital to discuss COVID impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=768)|
| 0:13:12| They'll be giving updates on where we are with hospital capacity, what we can expect in the future, vaccines and next steps, and there'll also be a Q&A session. So I would encourage anyone that has an interest in hearing from these hospital officials to please join in. I think all of my colleagues have received an invite as well. And so I just want to encourage everyone to please continue to practice the five core safety actions and to be safe. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=792)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie. So that's tomorrow at 3.30, and it's also going to be streamed for members of the public to watch as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=823)|
| 0:13:51| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Okay, moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| Mr. Johnson, would you please read 8A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| 8A is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville expressing support for the Mayor's appointment of Elena McCasick, Brent Wall, Phillip Hips, Brianna Holloway, and the reappointment of Emma Ellis-Cosigua, thank you, to the Neighborhood Advisory Council, and expressing appreciation to Jennifer Reynolds, Matt McMillan, and the Mayor of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=845)|
| 0:14:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=870)|

| 0:20:10| I had Ryder. Was it Ryder? Sorry. Councilmember Ryder, we need to approve. Who seconds it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| Anyone? Councilmember Smith and Roberto raised their hand. Any discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| I had a question. Okay. Councilmember Parker. There was an email that we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| with some updated numbers, and I was wondering if we could share that information on this call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1233)|
| 0:20:41| It came from David Brace, if David Brace is available. Yeah. David Brace, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1241)|
| 0:20:52| I see his name. I am. Okay. I've seen a lot of emails this last few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| so remind me if you can update Council and the public on this email, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| Councilmember Parker, remind me. I send a lot of emails. Which email was this that you're referring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| to? This was giving updated numbers on the unassigned fund balance and reserve. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1269)|
| 0:21:19| Yes, that was a lengthy email. So I do not have it pulled up, but the synopsis is, per code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| we keep a certain percentage of our bank account filled with dollars that we can cash flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1287)|
| 0:21:36| and it's about $46 million, and Ms. Juneau can jump in. That is what the 20% by code that we keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1296)|
| 0:21:44| in reserves in fund balance, which really helps us cash flow. It gives us protection because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1304)|
| 0:21:56| we have revenues that come in annually, tax revenues that come in throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| and our property taxes. So we keep that 20% in the bank. Then we have some dollars above and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| beyond that, and I believe the number right now is about $19 million as of June 30th, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| Ms. Juneau can jump in, of unassigned fund balance. That is correct, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you, of unassigned fund balance. And so when rating agencies look at us for our debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| and for bonding, they like to see, obviously, policies in place, the 20%. And then they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1346)|
| 0:22:34| like to see a certain number above the unassigned fund, excuse me, the assigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| And so right now, that number is about $15 million. So we've got 19, they like to see about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| $15 million. Again, so you're not constantly tapping into your reserves. There's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| cushion there. And so, again, I can pull the email up directly, but that's the summary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| municipal budgeting, which is the 20% by code that we have in the bank that helps us cash flow. We do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| have some above that called unassigned, but a portion of that our rating agencies like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| that as well. And so does that answer your question? Yes. And one other thing I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| to clarify is that the budget we passed anticipated that we would have to use around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1398)|
| 0:23:26| $11 million in our fund balance, and we expected to have $6 million at the end of this budget year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| in our unassigned fund balance. So we have projections, obviously, and that number that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| we talked about is as of June 30. I think what's important to know is, yes, at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| we could come out higher than anticipated based on one-time COVID dollars and based on tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1426)|
| 0:23:55| to date have been a little better. We don't know what January, February, and March are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| look like if we move into this dark winter. So, yes, we'll see where those numbers come in. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| think it is very important to note that we, and this was in the budget presentation, our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| revenues are now being outpaced by our expenses. And so if we went another budget year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1451)|
| 0:24:20| with our current operating budget and our current capital, we would draw down that unassigned fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| balance very, very quickly and start getting to a point where things would be concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| from a bond rating agency perspective. But, yes, you're right, because of those COVID dollars at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| this point and our projections are better than anticipated, we would hope that that fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| balance, the unassigned fund balance, would be a bit higher than anticipated. And so just the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| thing I wanted to clarify is in the email, you know, it was written in a way that you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1492)|
| 0:25:02| to prevent any misinformation. So I wanted to make sure that I was clear on all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| information because, you know, with anticipating using so much of the fund balance potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| based on our original projections and ending the year with 6 million in unassigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| 46 million around in the reserve, it seems like we would be underneath that 25% threshold that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1524)|
| 0:25:36| you discussed. And the reason I bring this up is just because I do not feel like we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| come up with a plan for how we're going to spend down our reserve because we're going through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| pandemic. But I do think it's important that we are clear that we have a policy in place, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1548)|
| 0:25:56| policy allows us to use those funds to respond to natural disasters like a global pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1556)|
| 0:26:06| That was one thing I wanted to clarify. Can you help me clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| I think that you have reserves for a number of reasons. Like anyone's budget, you want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1571)|
| 0:26:19| dollars in your savings to handle operating should you have zero revenue. And so just like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| you know, any financial advisor would say 3 to 6 months, some people even say 12 months now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| if you're operating in the bank so that you can continue to cash flow and not have to take out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| debt to cover operating. That's just good budgeting across the board, municipal, private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| family budgeting. So that 46 million is there to essentially help us not pay interest to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| the city. We're going to have a balanced budget. And then we have some unassigned, again, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| available to respond to needs so you're not tapping into your reserves all the time. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| say that the global pandemic, if we had had our revenues slashed by 50 or 60 percent, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| agree with your statement that it is time to tap into that. Because our revenues have continued to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| flow in at rates that we believe are higher than anticipated, and we've not seen that huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| shortfall, I would disagree with you that it is time to tap into that during the pandemic. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| think that it is there for very, very serious emergency situations. You tap into that 46| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| million, it would be, you know, something catastrophic like a major event in Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1651)|
| 0:27:39| where there was huge outages and major issues with revenue. So, and so, but I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| it is good to have, to always be aware that it's there should we need those and have no revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| coming in or have catastrophic needs to meet the safety and health of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you. And just to clarify, I'm not saying it's time to tap into it, but I think in moments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| like these it's important that City Council understand the policies that we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| and that policy does not prevent us from considering that money. But I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| your assessment that it's not time to tap into it, but it's important that we understand the policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1695)|

| 0:29:57| impressed that the Knox County Schools and Knox Education has navigators there to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| happen, because otherwise I'm not finding it's not easy to do. It's not easy. We may have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| services available, but to connect to them can be very, very difficult. And I still think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| this is kind of patching resources together. I hope in the future that we figure out some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1815)|

| 0:32:04| body. And so, for that reason alone, I'll be abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Okay. Councilmember Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| Councilmember Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1931)|

| 0:32:43| Thank you. Councilmember Singh, Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Yeah. Mayor and, I guess, Law Director, please correct me if I'm wrong, but there is nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| in this resolution that states anything about a political party, because that is not the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| of this resolution whatsoever. It is celebrating the fact that, historically, we are now in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| country, we now have the first female vice president and the first female vice president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| of color. And that's what this celebration is about. So, please correct me if somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| anything about a political party was listed in this resolution. Could you please point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| a clarification? No, Vice Mayor, there is no designation of any political party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2004)|
| 0:33:33| Thank you. Councilmember Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| I just want to state, I understand that this might be viewed as partisan by some, but I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| had friends of all political parties that have celebrated this and then, of course, be challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| by people because of the partisan affiliation with the particular candidate. But what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| conversation ended up, and that wasn't here among our group, it was amongst friends of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| is that we've had many women, not many women, actually run for these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| You know, Geraldine Ferrara, Sarah Palin, and Hillary Clinton are some of the women that tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| to attain these offices and were not able to be there and paved the way for Kamala Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| And one comment that was made is that it shouldn't be a discussion of whether someone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| female or male. And I think we can say now that that glass ceiling is shattered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| it is not a conversation point anymore. It's achieved. And now it doesn't have to be the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| because the first has been achieved and the glass ceiling is shattered. And so, I appreciate Kamala| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| Harris for achieving that for all of those women who ran before her and didn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| And I look forward to more women doing that. I know as a little girl, many of us women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| and of course, women older than me, that wasn't something you attained, you know, you worked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| We're only on our second woman mayor. Knox County's never had a female leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| We've never had a female governor in the state of Tennessee, as well as other states. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| this is shattering a glass ceiling. And I think that that's the way we look at it. And that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| I supported it. And I look forward to many, many more women running for these offices and winning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| them. Because I don't think that that should be an issue of whether you get there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| And I'm glad we finally gotten there. And I'll just tack on, I feel pretty impassioned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| this because when I ran, I had people who actually told me they would not vote for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| because I was female. I'm sorry they feel that way. And in the future, I hope that's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| discussion point. And I feel in future generations, it won't be. So, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| Let's say quickly for me, when I received the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| it gave me pause because I thought, would I be able to support a similar resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| for Marsha Blackburn? And my honest answer was, absolutely, in no way, absolutely, in no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| could I do it. I do think that representation is important, but I don't think it's all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| matters. I do think politics matter. And I think some people, well, anyway, I don't need to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2185)|
| 0:36:34| any further. But that's the reason why I did not request to be a cosponsor. I'm okay with supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2194)|
| 0:36:45| it. But in future, you know, if future individuals were put forth, it might not be someone I felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| comfortable supporting and someone I felt might do more harm than good. So, that was my reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2213)|
| 0:37:03| Thank you, Council Member Parker. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Yeah. Very quickly, Mayor, I just want to state to my colleagues that I think that that is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| is so unique about this collective governing body, that we are nonpartisan, and we absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2230)|
| 0:37:18| have a right to our own opinions and to be able to feel free to either support or not support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| anything that's on our agenda. And I do appreciate my colleagues sharing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| personal perspectives on why they feel they will support versus they will not. So, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| Thank you. Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2255)|
| 0:37:44| By the way, I think I just have to say with six members of Council being female and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| mayor being female, we're walking the walk as the City of Knoxville in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| making sure people vote for just the candidate they prefer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| not based on the sex of the candidates. Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| Okay. I had to get to my unmute. I wasn't going to say anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| but now I'm going to. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| I think this discussion we're having is exactly one of the reasons I'm not really wild about us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| presenting resolutions that don't have anything to do with the City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| because it unfortunately divides us when it doesn't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2305)|
| 0:38:33| I agree it's a woman. I will vote for it. I'm happy it's a woman, but I really do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| whether we intended to do it or not, it does make people choose sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| And that's one of the reasons I often abstain or vote no on resolutions that are not directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| related to City business. So that's just why I have voted against other resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| for this same reason, but I will support this one, but I understand the concern it causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2340)|
| 0:39:09| Thank you, Council Member Fugate. Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2349)|

| 0:41:39| Seconded by Council Member Testerman. Council Members, I just want to preface our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| discussion on this. Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| Sorry. I just know that many of you are excited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| as am I, about the many discussions that have been happening out in the community about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| prospect of baseball returning to Knoxville. We are still very early in our discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| but forming a sports authority is a step that we can take now to open options that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| potentially help us finance a sports stadium. I just want to be really clear, though, to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| and to members of the public. Establishing a sports authority does not commit the city or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| county to building a sports stadium. It simply provides us a tool, and I look forward to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| public discussions about how we can make baseball make sense for our community. We have several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| people. I'm going to ask my Deputy Stephanie Welch to share a bit more information, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| we have a few people sign up to speak. Ms. Welch, could you address the Council, please? There you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| are. Yes, thank you, Mayor, and good evening, Council. It's great to see everyone here this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| evening. I know there are probably questions about this resolution, and I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| maybe reiterate a little bit of what you heard from the Mayor in that establishing a sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| authority does not commit the city to anything, any financing or to building a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| A little bit of background, and I know that this isn't news to those of you who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| on Council, but we have been in preliminary discussions with the Tennessee Smokies baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| about the potential of the team moving to Knoxville, and we're really excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| those conversations and excited about the potential that they present, but we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| very early in the process, and the conversations are very preliminary. In order to continue those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| conversations forward, establishing a sports authority is a necessary step, and so I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| to sound a little bit like a broken record, and I apologize, but I just want to make sure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| reiterate that establishing a sports authority does not commit us to building a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| However, if we were to get to the point of building a baseball stadium or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| discussing, you know, furthering those discussions, we would need to establish a sports authority, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2645)|
| 0:44:14| it's a body that would not necessarily, it wouldn't have any function at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| and wouldn't be able to obligate the city or the county to any debt or any other type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| commitment without explicit direction and a vote by this body and also the way that we're configuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2667)|
| 0:44:36| this by county commission, so this is really intended to be a partnership with county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| commission and with the county government, and so we're, again, in the very preliminary stages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| looking forward to public discussion as we move the conversation forward, and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2689)|
| 0:44:59| multiple opportunities if the conversation proceeds, which we hope that it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| multiple opportunities for this body and for county commission as well to weigh in on decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2705)|
| 0:45:14| before any commitments can be made, so just wanted to provide some of that background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| I'm really excited also to be joined by someone who many of us know, Mr. Mark Mamentoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| who we're fortunate to have in Knoxville as Tennessee's really expert from a legal perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| on sports authorities. He's been very involved in establishing them in other parts of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| so I will stop there. Thank you, Ms. Welch. Council members, we usually would go to public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2741)|
| 0:45:50| you know, the speaker sign up before you all have your discussion and ask more questions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| comments, so without, if that's okay with you all, I'll go ahead and move to the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| signed up to speak to this. There's four people who signed up to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| Your rules state three for, three against, so we'll start with three against, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2766)|
| 0:46:13| if you all decide you want to hear from additional speakers, you can have that conversation at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| time. Does that sound good? Okay. The first person is Mr. Charles Albawi. Mr. Albawi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| uh, you, please, uh, if you're on the call, please start by saying your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes, and Mr. Johnson's going to keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| time for us. Mr. Albawi, can you speak up? I don't know if it's been unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2801)|
| 0:46:51| Okay, yes. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. This is Charles Albawi. My address is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| 1111 Texas Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee. So, there's a lot to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2818)|
| 0:47:09| First, I am against this sports authority being created. As the previous speaker just noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| it is a step towards continuing those preliminary conversations. Last year, we ran for city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2837)|
| 0:47:26| There was a clear commitment that we were not going to bring this stadium to Knoxville anytime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| soon. How quick things have changed. Second, these, there is already talks about a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2854)|
| 0:47:45| commitment of, I believe, somewhere between $40 and $60 million towards this baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| in the form of public financing, public debt. But when we're about to talk about this urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| renewal apology, we do not receive the same commitment. We talk, we'll look into grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2878)|
| 0:48:06| We'll see what's available, and we'll apply for it, but we're not going to go into public debt for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| it. However, it is one man who profits from the baseball stadium. It is an entire community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| that would benefit from the $100 million in urban renewal. This is a flagrant injustice. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2899)|
| 0:48:29| upsetting to me that you all would propose this literally on the same day. I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| whether you see the irony in proposing the sports authority, knowing you're in conversations to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| public debt towards the stadium, committing tens of millions of dollars towards this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| but you will not commit tens of millions of dollars towards the Black community who owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| the land before it was taken in the process of urban renewal. This is the very land that used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| to be known as the bottoms. We have to see that. I pray that that is not missed on you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2944)|
| 0:49:15| Look, Mr. Randy Boyd has done a lot of good. Pond Gap, his service learning program, I did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| when I was at the University of Tennessee my junior year. I have no doubt Mr. Boyd has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| best intentions, but there are higher priorities in the community of Knoxville at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| Whether it is the homeless, whether it is the devastating poverty rate for the Black community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2975)|
| 0:49:44| whether it is COVID, we have more urgent matters to attend to than this baseball stadium. Even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2984)|
| 0:49:53| the proposal, the fact that you want to spend time on this conversation instead of the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| about the homeless, about COVID, about the Black community, is frustrating. It is frustrating for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| all those who are working towards establishing a fair and just community. We want the best for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| everyone, not the best for one individual. Let me just say this. I would like to invite Mr. Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3015)|
| 0:50:29| to a meeting to discuss a possible community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| My phone number is public. We will set up that meeting with the necessary organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| so we can discuss it. But even that, that is still with absolutely a no to this right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| and a no, no matter what, to any public funds being spent on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| But we already know that he has asked for public funds to be spent on his project. So what we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| like to do in our urgent time of need is to request him to commit the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3065)|
| 0:51:13| We will say no to his offer, but we will make an offer. Will he commit to $60 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3073)|
| 0:51:22| towards the apology for the Black community? Then we will not have to look for where those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| grants will come from. We will know. 30 seconds left. Mr. Boyd, will you commit $60 million over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| a span of 10 years to invest in the Black community as an apology for urban renewal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3095)|
| 0:51:43| Thank you, Council. We appreciate your time and all the hard work that you have put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| Peace and blessings. Thank you, Mr. Albaugh. The next person signed up to speak on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3109)|

| 0:52:21| you'll make, a possible $65 million expenditure in county and city funds for a new stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3141)|
| 0:52:29| The decision whether or not to make this expenditure must come as a result of careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| and inclusive community outreach. If formed, the most important functions of this authority will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| not be financial. They will come from meeting Knoxville residents where they are comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3160)|

| 0:52:52| any proposal that fails to gain broad community approval. If this council founds the sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3172)|

| 0:53:12| and which of our neighbors may be impacted positively or negatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| in ways not reflected by the bottom line. Author and economist Pat Garofalo wrote a book called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3196)|

| 0:54:33| while resulting in increased local rent. Given this body of research, a sports authority must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| be empowered and encouraged to reject any proposal that cannot demonstrate significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| community support and establish substantial and diverse community benefits. We can look to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3285)|

| 0:55:58| neighborhoods. Later tonight, the council will consider how irresponsible development that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| ignored community has created inequity that resounds through the decades. Your job now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3364)|
| 0:56:12| is to make sure the echoes of your decisions won't require similar measures in the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hughes. The next person signed up to speak on this is Michael O'Malley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| signed up also to speak against it. Mr. O'Malley, are you on the call? Yes, can you hear me? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| you can please start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| five minutes. Okay, my name is Michael O'Malley, and I live at 2744 Woodbine Avenue. I'm also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3393)|
| 0:56:42| calling in to oppose this, not because I'm inherently opposed to the idea of a stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3402)|
| 0:56:51| downtown or even, like Ms. Welch mentioned, just the sports authority as just a step toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3411)|
| 0:57:00| However, I do feel, as the other speakers have, that this seems to be rushing into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3420)|
| 0:57:09| even preliminary talks before the community groundwork has been done to justify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3429)|
| 0:57:18| As others have mentioned, there's a lot of public money being thrown around. I know not by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| specific resolution, but this resolution pushes us a little bit closer to some of those public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| funds. And I guess my biggest question and reservation here and why I think that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| have more community involvement before even taking this preliminary step is how will the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| public have input on this sports authority, and how will the community be represented in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| that will benefit the public, and especially East Knoxville, which, if the stadium project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| eventually goes forward, is one of the neighborhoods that is adjacent. I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3475)|
| 0:58:03| as others have mentioned, I would like to see, before feeling comfortable with even creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| the sports authority, a real dedicated position by the city that this project will be leveraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| for public good in addition to just private investment, especially considering the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| dollars that potentially are on the table by taking this preliminary step. And specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| as others have mentioned, it would be good and comforting to me if there were a commitment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3510)|
| 0:58:38| some sort of community benefits agreement or something similar that would address ways in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| which a huge development like this could tangibly benefit the local community rather than simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3525)|
| 0:58:53| changing or making the local community more expensive and less livable. So, things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| that might include might be leveraging, you know, the ability for a sports authority to leverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| for funds being used to create affordable housing out of this project or using revenue to house the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3546)|
| 0:59:13| homeless or, as the previous speaker mentioned, using the sports authority to leverage the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| a commitment that locals would be employed working and at a high wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| commitments that this project would not accelerate gentrification but commit to things that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| slow it, such as investing in, again, affordable housing and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| a commitment that this, you know, moving forward with the sports authority would prioritize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| empowering the black community in East Knoxville rather than becoming another milestone in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| history of displacement in the east end of downtown for black residents and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3595)|
| 1:00:04| you know, a commitment to expanding Knoxville's social safety net in some way, a commitment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3604)|
| 1:00:13| helping to expand or improve public transit in the surrounding communities. I think all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| these would be good ways to show the communities that the creation of a sports authority is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3618)|
| 1:00:26| yet another step in, you know, private funds being ‑‑ or, sorry, public funds being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| to enrich private interests. I think there needs to be a real message from the city that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| public good that is being ‑‑ One minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| Um, rather than just simply a blanket like we would like to commit as ‑‑ we would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| create a sports authority. So until there's something like that, I am very uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| with even taking the small ‑‑ the small step forward and I would like to see the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| members, you know, create that face forward rather than simply rushing into this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| Thank you, Mr. O'Malley. Just a brief technical matter before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| The stream is down apparently. So Mr. Johnson, if you could contact CTV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| and tell them that some members of the public are not able to watch this because the stream is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| Yes, mayor, I just emailed CTV. Okay. We'll go ahead and proceed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| and I'm sure they'll fix it before ‑‑ And it looks like it's back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| Is it? Okay. TV was working. It was streaming that was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3700)|

| 1:01:52| This can be posted if we need to pause or anything. Council members, there's a fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3712)|

| 1:02:14| I'm just following your own rules. Your rules say three, four, three against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| There's nobody signed up to speak for it. There's one additional person to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| Otherwise we'll move along. I would like to hear the added person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3743)|

| 1:02:33| Is there a second? I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| Seconded by Ms. Parker. Any further discussion or questions on this motion to allow an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3756)|

| 1:03:53| throughout this meeting. So let's just get right to it. So this resolution to create a sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| authority will have impacts of speeding up modern day urban renewal in Knoxville. This resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| places the wants of a multimillionaire, Randy Boyd, over the needs of the community. To quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| this resolution, it says, this is an important early step in the process of negotiating a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| potential relocation of the Tennessee Smokies baseball team to Knoxville's old city. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| why we have this in front of us. So this land that was taken from Black communities decades ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3864)|

| 1:04:37| class and surrounding poor communities with new, richer, and more well-off residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| Zero tax dollars should be going to this project that could decimate East Knoxville. The so-called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| economic activity that will be brought will not largely benefit the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| Increasing temporary low-wage service industry jobs is not helping our economic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| Spending money on this means less money towards other resources our communities need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| I am against the stadium and this authority, but if you must move forward, use this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| please, to work with the community to create a community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| a contract between the community and the developer so we can make sure the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| especially Black community, benefits from this development. And this has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| I believe, by every single speaker before me. And I think it was mentioned again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| I think it was what was also mentioned out in Nashville. They got a CBA, a community benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| agreement with their soccer stadium and had new affordable housing, a child care facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| rental spaces for local businesses, small local businesses at reduced rates, stronger labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| practices and living wages, inclusion of Black minority contractors. You know, if we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| to have anything happening in this area, we need to have that agreement. We need to. So we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| need another stadium and we don't need a new authority, but we do need investment in housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| and social and health services. So if you must move forward, I think me and many others think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| the correct move would be to cease the work on this authority and work with the community for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| a community benefits agreement so we can actually be proud of what's happening. And I will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| extending the legacy of urban renewal at the same time of apologizing for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| is an interesting move. I just wanted to bring that up. But I hope you all listened to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3986)|
| 1:06:33| speakers who spoke with me today and I hope you all vote against this and work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| to build it. Thank you. Okay, thank you, Mr. Hayes. Council, that concludes all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| signed up to speak to this. A motion's been made and seconded. So now it's your opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| discuss and ask questions. Vice Mayor McKenzie. Thank you, Mayor. And I appreciate all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| speakers that have signed up to speak. And I'm in agreement that, you know, if the stadium were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4016)|
| 1:07:04| move forward, that absolutely there would need to be some agreements that would be our commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| to the community. I am acutely aware of that and have been looking at what those potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| could be. So a lot of things that were stated that have already been topics that are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| important and I'm keenly aware again of what this community needs as it relates to investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| And I don't believe that there's anything that should be put in close proximity to a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| especially one that has a history such as East Knoxville in that vicinity and area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| that we would not look to negotiate in working on some community benefit agreements. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| wanted to, again, thank the speakers for your comments and your concerns as well. And there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| will be more information as we get to that space in time. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4072)|
| 1:08:01| Hunter and Council Member Stang. I'm really disappointed to see this on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4081)|
| 1:08:10| our last agenda of 2020 in the midst of a pandemic. I met briefly with Randy Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4090)|
| 1:08:20| several months ago, as I know many of you have as well, maybe all of you. Our meeting was short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| because it was during a pandemic and I did not want to do an indoor meeting for longer than an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| hour. So it could not be as long as I'd want it to be. I know that there were other meetings in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| the community that community members told me about that I wasn't invited to or aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4119)|
| 1:08:47| And when I tried to invite other community members to the meeting, I was told that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| were space restrictions because of COVID. So any sort of outreach this year has been limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4133)|
| 1:09:01| understandably, because of COVID. But that certainly means that we have not done the outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| to get the public input on this project. Secondly, or thirdly, that we have had no discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4148)|
| 1:09:17| as a City Council about whether this is a viable economic development model that we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4157)|
| 1:09:27| invest in, invest our energy in, invest our resources in. It has been brought to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4167)|
| 1:09:36| for limited discussion tonight and then a vote. We've had workshops on much simpler topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4176)|
| 1:09:45| than such a major economic development initiative as this. So I'm quite surprised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| quite disappointed that this is even on our agenda tonight. I have at least an hour's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4193)|
| 1:10:01| worth of questions. So I can start. I can, you know, pass it over if anybody else has any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| introductory questions. Yeah, I think, I think some other Council members have their hands up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| so maybe you can rotate around and take turns. And I'd also, you know, after we have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4215)|
| 1:10:22| my intention is to make a motion to postpone. Because it's absolutely ridiculous that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4222)|
| 1:10:31| being asked to vote on this tonight. It's absolutely disingenuous for you to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| there's no intention for public dollars to be committed to this, when the only details any of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| have been given is the proposal put forward by Randy Boyd, which is clear. When I spoke to Randy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| Boyd, he was clear that this project could not move forward without public funding. It is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| disingenuous for you to put this on our agenda and try to make the statement to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| that this does not commit us to the stadium. I will pause there. I have more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4265)|
| 1:11:13| Thank you, Ms. Parker. I'll just reiterate, this does not commit us to anything. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| the beginning of the discussion. Yes, disingenuous. Ms. Singh. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4277)|
| 1:11:26| This is for Stephanie Welch. Could you tell me how this sports authority got started? Who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| the applicants for it? And the models that were followed from other cities? Is that what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| following to create this? Sure. Thank you so much, Councilwoman Singh. I appreciate all the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| I've heard so far. I think this is, again, just to reiterate, the beginning of public dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| about baseball and the potential of a baseball stadium. We're getting great feedback just from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| this meeting and the public speakers. So, I really appreciate people taking the time to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| in tonight's meeting. So, yes, I can give you an answer to that question. How did the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| about a sports authority start? So, we have been, as you know, because many of you have also been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| in communication with Mr. Boyd and his team about the potential of baseball moving back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4341)|
| 1:12:29| And in the course of those discussions, we also have had some preliminary conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4349)|
| 1:12:37| the county administration about their interest in participating in this process as well. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4357)|
| 1:12:46| as we began those discussions, both with the administration and members of Mr. Boyd's team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| it became clear, you know, pretty soon that in order to even be able to move forward with any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| additional discussion about forming, you know, building a baseball stadium, even to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| that, we would need to form a sports authority. And I think Mr. Mamentoff can probably speak more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| to the legal reasons that you would need to form a sports authority to provide options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| just to be able to consider your options around financing, which you need to understand those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| options in order to be able to have an informed discussion about how to proceed. And ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4405)|
| 1:13:34| a public sports stadium would need to be, would involve forming a sports authority. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4414)|
| 1:13:42| first step, we have to form a sports authority to continue the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| and to begin the conversation in a public manner. So, you know, both mayors are in support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4426)|
| 1:13:56| moving forward with this discussion. So, they are applicants for the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| We also have Vice Mayor McKenzie and County Commission Chairman Larson Jay, who are also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4442)|
| 1:14:10| I'm not speaking on their behalf, but I know they were in favor of forming a sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| because they both agreed to sign on as applicants. And then we have former mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| former Mayor Daniel Brown, City Mayor Daniel Brown, and former County Executive, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| Tommy Shumpert, who are both very engaged citizens in this community, who felt like the formation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4466)|
| 1:14:34| a sports authority, as the city administration does, is a good first step. So, they all agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| to sign on as applicants, which is part of the process that's required under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| to form a sports authority. Does that answer your question, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| It does. And then just one other question. Is it possible in the formation of a sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| to include a provision that a community benefits agreement needs to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| reached, discussed? Can we put that within this structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| I mean, I think a couple of thoughts about that is, first of all, I mean, could that be on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| table? And I can't say that it can't. I certainly would have to consult with people who have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| legal expertise in the powers and authorities of sports authorities. But I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| I'm hearing that your question is, could we add that to the table of discussion? And certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| I think, you know, we can discuss that with Mr. Mamentoff. We may need to do a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| more research. I think the other thing to keep in mind, however, is that this is a joint effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4543)|
| 1:15:50| with Knox County. So, this is not going to be a decision of City Council alone. It's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| something that I'm quite excited about. I find that governments that work best are governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| that are collaborative. And so, I think the county has been very collaborative in the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4561)|
| 1:16:08| initial stages of this discussion. So, we would want to have that discussion with them. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| the third thing is that the research that I've done on community benefits agreements, and I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| by no means an expert, is that those really are agreements that are reached between a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4578)|
| 1:16:27| nonprofit and a private developer. And the sports authority is neither of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| Okay. And then I just want to add in that I have spoken with Randy Boyd a couple times about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| is he willing to work with the community on a community benefits agreement? And he's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| open to that. And as long as he is open to that, I'm going to continue supporting this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| or at least the sports authority. Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| Council Member Thomas. Yes, I do have a couple of introductory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| questions. The step that we're considering tonight, what kind of expenditure of city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| funds are we talking about? Just this step we're considering tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| Ms. Welch, it's my understanding zero. We're not committing any dollars at all. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| the establishment of the authority that could then move forward to make steps. And this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| public process that we're starting to engage in with the city and with the county. And all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| questions need to be asked. Today commits us to nothing. It just commits us to the establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| of the authority. But I do want to just say, reiterate something I've said all along before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| I was even elected mayor, is that I do hope that we can bring baseball back, but I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| do so unless the benefits to the public exceed the cost to the public. But a public stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| a public park is like many amenities that we invest in. It's something that would be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| to the public, not just for baseball, but for many things. And so I think that as we discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| move forward, I would want to, you know, I have some ideas that it should be open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| It should be a street facing design that is pedestrian friendly, that is accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4687)|
| 1:18:15| that has active activities, you know, 365 days and nights a year. That's not just a dead space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| except on game nights during a minor league baseball season. So those are some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| things that I've articulated and would want to continue to hear from the community, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| council members on. But that's not what we're deciding tonight. You know, and also I hear good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| ideas about apprenticeships and other ways that we can involve the community. Those are all things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| that council and other members of the community can continue to provide input on after we, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4723)|
| 1:18:50| know, after Sports Authority is created. Mr. Thomas. Yes, just a very nuts and bolts question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4730)|
| 1:18:58| I think the public would like to hear just basically what would be the tasks of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| Sports Authority? Why would we create them and to do what? Mr. Mametoff, would you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4743)|
| 1:19:11| or Stephanie, is that for Mr. Mametoff? Mark Mametoff, would you answer that question for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| please? Sure, I'd be glad to answer that. My name is Mark Mametoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| Tennessee. Let me share with you how the Sports Authorities have operated in other jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| because if you all at some point decide to move forward with this project, Sports Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| would probably play a similar role here. The reason that the first reason that we thought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| might be a wise idea to start this process with the governing body in the state county by asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| if you wanted to create a Sports Authority is to begin the discussion of this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| Obviously, if you decide not to create this entity, it's a strong signal that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| move forward with the process. This, again, is just a very initial step. Why take this initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| step? Well, under state law, there's a special sales tax provision. You probably read maybe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| the paper about this because other media have asked me about it. This says that basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| if you do a double-A baseball stadium, you will pay sales tax increment off the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| You have to have a Sports Authority in place to do that. It's hard to say exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4827)|
| 1:20:34| and we're certainly going to bring that type of information back to you, but it's roughly maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| say $300,000, $400,000 of annual income over a 30-year period. That's obviously a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| significant sum of money. The logistical issue of setting up a Sports Authority is to hopefully be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| ready to be able to capture that state sales tax increment. Along those same lines, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4854)|
| 1:21:02| like to have the opportunity, because this is going to be, and I know you all have all seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| some drawings of this, a large multi-use development. It's going to include some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| residential, a very substantial amount of retail, and we hope to be able to broaden the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4873)|
| 1:21:21| possibly to be able to seek additional, to not just capture the immediate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4881)|
| 1:21:29| We want to have the Sports Authority set up so that we can legitimately seek support from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4889)|
| 1:21:37| the legislature to possibly look at that alternative. That was the primary reason we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| came here. In some jurisdictions, Council Member Thomas, it's set up purely to capture that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4903)|
| 1:21:52| increment. They don't do anything. They sit back and serve as a funnel to capture that increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4912)|
| 1:22:01| In other jurisdictions, Metro, which is the one that has used this the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| they have served as the primary procurement method for the stadium, but more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4927)|
| 1:22:15| they've served as the financing vehicle for the stadium. Why do you use a Sports Authority? Why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| don't you just get the city and county to issue bonds to do that? There's a number, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| I'm sure it's going to be a long discussion at some point if you all decide you want to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| with this project, but there are financing legal reasons why stadiums throughout the state have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| been done in recent years using a Sports Authority and what I like to call a funding agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| because I think it's the most accurate thing, where basically that if there are shortfalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| in the projected revenues, which likely would involve rent, sales tax captures I just talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| about, other revenues, that that's what we would be working on the next few months if you all decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| to proceed to this so that we can bring you a meaningful financial plan that you can decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| whether this is something that you want to move forward with as a city. To be able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4989)|
| 1:23:19| the Sports Authority would help serve as the vehicle to be able to do that, but they have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| borrowing capacity from a credit perspective. As I was telling County Commission, because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| asked a lot of the same questions last night, could they just go out and basically go rogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| and do their own borrowing? They just don't have the capacity to do that. Candidly, if we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| figure out how the Sports Authority could finance a baseball stadium without having any agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| whatsoever with the city or county, I think you guys would probably be cheering us on, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| not likely to happen. In Metro and all their major public stadium facilities, as you all know, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| have not only Titans Coliseum and Bridgestone Arena and the Sounds Baseball Stadium, but now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| they're adding the MLS Stadium that has come up, is that the Sports Authority issues the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| and then they have a funding agreement with Metro to make up shortfalls in revenues. Those shortfalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| cannot be paid from property tax revenues. They have to be paid from non-property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| revenues so that the idea is that you would not have a property tax hike to pay for a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5061)|
| 1:24:29| Again, these are the sort of details, again, I know that this body will want to spend a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| time understanding and doing, but we're just getting started. I'm just trying to describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| how these operate in other jurisdictions. They typically issue the debt, they typically have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| a funding agreement with the bodies that do that. Right now, we don't have a legal entity like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| Sports Authority jointly created by the city or county that can serve in this purpose. The Public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| Building Authority is the only similar body that has been jointly formed by the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| for public project purposes and it is not a good fit for this project because it doesn't contain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| a number of the things that are unique to stadium ownership, stadium management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| dealing with professional sports teams, and with this funding agreement that I talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| There is no existing public vehicle to basically kick off the process to hold the public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5118)|
| 1:25:28| necessary to move this forward, to bring a proposal back to you all so that you can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| whether this is in the best interest of the community. We're trying to establish that vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| to get this going. A lot of people say, well, how many staff members will they have? My guess is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| we'll have no staff members, that this will be staffed by the city and the county. As someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| said, there'll be no immediate expense to this, but it's primarily being set up again as a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| to start moving this process forward and to give you all an opportunity to say, no, we don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5154)|
| 1:26:02| you to move forward with this because really the only expense at this point is me. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| it's me and Stephanie and Chris Caldwell's time and our efforts to try to move this forward so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| can provide you with a presentation on what the sources of revenues would be and what the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5173)|
| 1:26:21| and exposure would be in the event there's a shortfall from the expected revenues to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5181)|
| 1:26:28| pay for the stadium. Thank you, Mr. Mamentoff. Mr. Thomas, do you have more questions or several?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5188)|
| 1:26:36| As he continued, he actually asked my second question, which was how it was to be staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| so I will defer to my colleagues now. Okay, we'll go to Vice Mayor McKenzie and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| Council Member Fugate and then Council Member Smith. So, Vice Mayor McKenzie, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Mamentoff, a couple of questions. So, the formation of the Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| Authority is in no way saying that the city or the county has made a commitment to go into any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| memorandum of agreement or contract to commit to, you know, moving forward with the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5226)|
| 1:27:14| Is that a correct statement, yes or no? I'm so sorry. I hit my mute button. That is absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| correct. There is no legal commitment to provide funding or any contractual agreements by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| approving the creation of the stadium. Okay. Second question, Mr. Mamentoff. In the event that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| the city or the county or both decide not to move forward with the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| would the Sports Authority board be dissolved, or what would be the purpose of them at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5259)|
| 1:27:46| The Sports Authority, if either of the two entities decided not to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5266)|
| 1:27:55| and if one or the other decided to move forward on their own, I would encourage them to form their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| own Sports Authority at that point that they totally control on their own. At this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| the project is moving forward as a joint. It's not a legal partnership, but it's perceived if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| that's the intent of both the administrations at this point. But if either one of them decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| and the other one wanted to come over, they should probably form their own Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| This Sports Authority would have no assets, would have no need to exist, and we certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| at that point, would encourage that board to either dissolve, or they would do no harm by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| continuing to exist because they would have no assets, but it would make sense for them just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| to dissolve at that point. Okay. And just to be clear, Memphis, Nashville, and Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5317)|
| 1:28:45| each have Sports Authorities at this point. I'm sorry? I'm sorry. I don't mean to correct you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| but Chattanooga, I can't assure you of that one, but Memphis and Nashville definitely do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| Clarksville has one that we just reformed for them. They're doing a multi-purpose arena there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| that Austin Peay is going to use. And so if you search Sports Authority in the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| there's a bunch of entities that show up. Many of them are not active. As I told County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| Commission, I think there may be seven active Sports Authorities in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| Okay. Yeah. At one time, Chattanooga did have one. So I just kind of want to make that clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| that there are some active ones already within the state. And Ms. Welch, I know that at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5364)|
| 1:29:33| we have had conversation about having a workshop around the stadium. We were not at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5373)|
| 1:29:41| to have enough information to really share, and there was also some conversation around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| the potential to see if County Commission would be interested in actually having a joint one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| since both collective bodies have an interest at this point in learning more about what that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| look like and that commitment. So Ms. Welch, I'd like to ask if you would, since you're leading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| this project per se, if you would continue to maybe work with me on trying to coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5404)|
| 1:30:11| a workshop, either individually with Council or collectively with the County Commission, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| Okay. Council Member Huger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Ramitoff, I just want to be clear in that what I think I'm hearing from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5427)|
| 1:30:36| that we're creating a sports authority because it is a way to capture dedicated sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5436)|
| 1:30:45| that we could not otherwise get to help pay on perhaps debt that is issued. I say that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5445)|
| 1:30:56| I'm old enough to remember. I think the Convention Center had some type of special tax district that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| helped pay for it. There are other special tax districts like the CBID where there's tax money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| that's collected that's used. Is that correct or am I way off base? Ms. Fugate, you're absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5469)|
| 1:31:20| on base and no pun intended by that. Oh, that was a good one. Yes, but no, you started it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5480)|
| 1:31:29| But the TDZ in downtown Knoxville is actually something when I had dark hair that I worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| and to some extent it was based on this concept of the sales tax recapture for baseball stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5496)|
| 1:31:46| This type of sales tax recapture has been in the Tennessee Code for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| It is like a mini TDZ. You're absolutely right. It's very similar to what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5510)|
| 1:32:00| downtown to help pay for the Convention Center. It's a different statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| but the concept is very similar. Then my next question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| can a sports authority do anything other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5530)|
| 1:32:19| minor league baseball? I think I read that if the city wanted a sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5539)|
| 1:32:26| you could do amateur sports. I know that there are cities that have tremendous sports facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5546)|
| 1:32:34| that are used for competitive sports, that kind of thing. Could a sports authority do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| if you did not want to use it for minor league? I heard your point about if this would be a joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| venture and this would have to dissolve, but I'm just asking, can sports authorities be used in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| other ways other than for a professional sports? Yes, it's got a wide scope of purposes in state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5572)|
| 1:33:03| law. For example, as you mentioned, if the city and the county decided at the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| you all decided and that all worked out, say five years from now, you wanted the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| because both the city and the county wanted to collaborate again on an amateur sports complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| in downtown, say on the river or something. I don't know. This entity would be the perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| vehicle for accomplishing that. Okay. I just wanted to be clear that it doesn't have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| for professional sports. No, it does not at all have to be for professional sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| For anything else? Yes. It's been highlighted largely because of what's gone on in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| with the influx of professional sports teams there. Right. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| Fugate. Council Member Smith. Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Mametov, the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| acts in a similar fashion in terms of capturing money from the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5634)|
| 1:34:02| for projects. Why can't that organization be utilized for this? That's a good... I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| trying to flatter you, but that's a good question. The reason that we have two Industrial Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| Boards, as you probably know, we have a City Industrial Development Board and a County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| Industrial Development Board. Each are appointed by their separate bodies. I think you all may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| have had some appointments to the City Industrial Development Board earlier tonight or are on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| agenda. So, there's no legal relationship of the county to the City Board or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| Here, you're trying to do a collaborative project where the two governmental entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5672)|
| 1:34:38| are, at this juncture at least, trying to share any funding and exposure equally. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| it generally makes sense to try to create an entity that is representative of both bodies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| would reflect the views of both bodies and that both bodies had input into who served on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5692)|
| 1:34:59| board. And so, we could create a joint IDB, a fourth IDB here in Knox County to do similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5699)|
| 1:35:08| things, but its scope of powers is more limited than the Industrial Development Board. The funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| mechanism that I've talked about two or three times is much more limited than the IDB statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| Yes, Memphis did one of their stating projects using their downtown IDB, but it was not, in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| judgment, as smooth a transaction and as well-situated legally. And so, I do believe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5725)|
| 1:35:33| sports authority is a better fit for what you are trying to accomplish here at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| Just as a follow-up, because we're doing a joint sports authority with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| all of those members will have to be approved by this body and the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| to be appointed to that authority, correct? Yes. I mean, that's what the charter is proposed. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| state law actually allows. We could have done, say, 10 members, five from each organization, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5753)|
| 1:36:02| I think the mayors felt and are recommending to you all that they want to have a membership that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| reflects the views of the entire community. And so, you all get to sign off on every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| member and county commission as well. So, it's indicative of the collaborative nature of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| that everyone would like both bodies to be comfortable with all the members that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| serving on the sports authority. Thank you. Thank you. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| Thank you. Just following up on the last statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5789)|
| 1:36:37| you know, the concept of the sports authority, you know, it's moving away from how this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5797)|
| 1:36:46| was described to me even six months ago. And six months ago, you know, the project was brought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5806)|
| 1:36:54| me and there was, you know, all of this attention given to the gym development corporation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5814)|
| 1:37:06| honoring the legacy and the history of that area. But through this discussion of the sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| authority, it seems like we want to make sure that there is benefit throughout the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| and as much buy-in in the county as in the city. That concerns me. One question I have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5838)|
| 1:37:28| has the city done any work, done any studies to assess what the impact could be on the immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5848)|
| 1:37:39| surrounding neighborhoods by this project? Thank you, Ms. Parker. Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| Yeah. Thank you, Mayor. And Ms. Parker, just to clarify, because I, Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| the gym development corporation is actually focused on the private development that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| you know, surrounding but isn't the stadium itself. So that entity is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5878)|
| 1:38:06| that's the focus of that entity. So I just wanted to make sure that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| you under, that that's clear to everyone. So, you know, one of the things, I think you've asked a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| really good question about impacts and that's something that the city, the county and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5898)|
| 1:38:26| the city and the county have been talking about is making sure that we're, that we're doing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| thorough assessment of the impact of the stadium in multiple ways. So thanks for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5912)|
| 1:38:41| So you haven't, you want to form the sports authority and you have not done the assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| yet. Yes. And I have a feeling, I mean, I'm looking forward to hearing your questions because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| I think that they will be really informative. I think that that's the phase of the process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| we're at is to really understand, and this is a great conversation because it helps us to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5937)|
| 1:39:04| inform how we move forward. I wouldn't be comfortable coming to you with answers to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| bunch of questions that don't reflect what you would like to know moving forward. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| this is a really good opportunity for us to make sure that we're capturing those questions and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| we're addressing them as we move forward from here. And it makes me, you know, again, just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| to reiterate that we're really early in the process. So, I mean, I've had this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| with the city so many times I can't even tell y'all this is a science museum. This is every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| conversation, every conversation the city tries to make it seem like we're in the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5983)|
| 1:39:49| stages. This is very early and the city council has many opportunities to stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| And then there's some funny business and that doesn't seem to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| Okay, so I had questions about the financing. Mr. Mamatov, you mentioned that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6000)|
| 1:40:11| the sports authority would be responsible for the financing and procurement for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6011)|
| 1:40:20| Is that correct? It would be misleading for me to say that's all been decided but that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| been the typical practice in other similar projects. And that's also how it's outlined in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| the charter, correct? But the charter gives them the authority to do that and that's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| with state law but doesn't require that they be the ones that do that. So if we are creating a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6039)|
| 1:40:47| which by charter has those responsibilities, at what point would we be able as a body city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6047)|
| 1:40:59| to impact future negotiations with private developers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6059)|
| 1:41:10| Do you mean private developers for properties adjacent to a stadium complex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| For the stadium. Okay, Mr. Mamatov, I mean it's my understanding that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| wouldn't be a private development. So I'm not sure what your question is. I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| mayor, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Yeah, the stadium itself would be a publicly owned facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| likely by the sports authority and would not end there. But there is, I think as Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| Parker, as you mentioned that there will be a large amount of private development around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| The community benefit agreement that's been brought up a number of times in Metro was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| agreement between the entity that was doing the soccer team and a local non-profit. The sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| authority was not a party to that nor was the Metro government. And so there's, you know, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| if a community organization would like to negotiate in that respect with the team similar to what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| did there, you know, that's separate from the sports authority and from the city. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| this administration is obviously very supportive and wants this, as the mayor said, to be for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| overall community good. And you're going to have an opportunity certainly to vote on the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| agreement. The main documents are going to be a lease with the team. I can't speak obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6143)|
| 1:42:31| for the mayor and Ms. Welch, but I can't imagine that they wouldn't want us to come and brief you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| on these negotiations regularly. And at some point when we have a meaningful outline of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6155)|
| 1:42:42| financial deal that we come in and go over and get your input on, whether it's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| you guys can support, we just aren't there yet. They're still formulating their development around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| the stadium. I think we've all seen some really pretty pictures, but we're looking for commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6175)|
| 1:43:02| What are you really willing to do at this point? And so that we can provide some meaningful input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| to you all as to what the likely economic benefit to the community is. So I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6187)|
| 1:43:16| If I could just reiterate, I think Vice Mayor McKenzie earlier in tonight's conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| asked for and we agreed to do a workshop on baseball stadium and related topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6200)|
| 1:43:28| with City Council before there's any commitment of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| I would be happy for us to postpone this agenda item until after the workshop, and I can reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| my questions until the workshop. I'll move to postpone this agenda item if someone will second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| it. Okay, motion made to postpone by Council Member Parker. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| Council Member Singh, are you seconding or do you have a question? We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6233)|
| 1:44:01| You're on mute, Ms. Singh. I was just talking up a storm. I think there's more discussion to be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6241)|
| 1:44:08| and I think that the council can have more of a voice on seeing if a CBA can be, community benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6248)|
| 1:44:16| agreement can be part of the sports authority. So I'd like some time to work on that. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| seconding. Okay, there's a motion made to postpone by Ms. Parker, seconded by Ms. Singh. Any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| discussion or questions? Mayor, what's the time period for the postponement? Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| Until after our workshop on this issue. Okay, sorry, I need to, I think this is a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6274)|
| 1:44:45| motion. I'm not, you know, a substitute motion to postpone that supplants the- It's not a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6285)|
| 1:44:53| motion, it's a priority motion. Okay, so I don't need, okay, so it's a substitute motion. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| you, Mr. Swanson. It's been made and seconded. It would postpone to date after a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6297)|
| 1:45:04| Council, so I would just like to say that I think a postponement tonight is not necessary because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| this doesn't commit the city to anything except the establishment of a sports authority, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| would still everything, everything that would come that is connected to money, design, and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6313)|
| 1:45:21| things would be, are still in the future, still to be negotiated. And we can have that workshop with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| you all, even if you approve the sports authority tonight, which I hope you'll do, because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| that's an important element to enabling things to happen in a financial way and so forth. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6332)|
| 1:45:39| I think postponement isn't necessary because this isn't a big firm commitment. This is just a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6339)|
| 1:45:46| step moving us forward. Ms. Ryder, we can't hear you. You can't hear me. I had a question that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6346)|
| 1:45:57| wanted to, I wanted to ask about timeframes, but now we have this other motion on the floor. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| can I go ahead and ask my questions? Obviously. Okay. Well, let's vote on the motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6363)|
| 1:46:11| or not, because that would end the discussion for tonight. So you can discuss the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6371)|
| 1:46:19| But I think that if we're following Robert's Rules of Order, that's the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| So if you have a question about the postponement or a comment. Well, I have a question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| timeframe. Those are my questions. Okay, go ahead. I think that's relevant to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| postponement. Ms. Welch or Mr. Mantoff, what, sports authority, okay, we've talked a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6395)|
| 1:46:44| about what it is. What's the timeframe? I mean, what are we talking about here? Before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| we've been talking about baseball and the media, not to knock the media, has been swirling rumors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| about it for several years now. So what's the timeframe? What do you guys, what kind of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6417)|
| 1:47:06| do you need to do what you need to do? And what is it you're doing? I guess that's what we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| understand. The timeframe. Ms. Welch or Mr. Mantoff, can you answer Ms. Rogers' questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6430)|
| 1:47:18| please? Yes. I mean, I think at this point, if there's a postponement, that changes the timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| So, I mean, I'm a little bit unclear about how to answer the question without first knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6443)|
| 1:47:31| what council would like to do about a postponement. I'm really sorry, Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6451)|
| 1:47:39| And what they said at the commission meeting was that the team wanted to play in this stadium by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| 2023. And that was why this needed to be rushed. I don't see the urgency behind trying to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6464)|
| 1:47:52| the players' wishes to be able to play in the new stadium in 2023. They have contract through 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| Can we have some time to figure out if this is the best next step for our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6478)|
| 1:48:05| So at this point, I realize that there has been press coverage and about the baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6485)|
| 1:48:14| that, you know, to be honest with you, this body has not had a workshop. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6494)|
| 1:48:21| that is true, Ms. Parker. That has been in the press. We would love to see, you know, a stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6501)|
| 1:48:29| you know, in our community, but we realize there is a process and we have to follow that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| So I just, I will go back to it's difficult to outline a timeframe without first understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6514)|
| 1:48:43| how council would like to proceed. I guess as a point of order, you all need to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6523)|
| 1:48:50| the postponement and then vote on the postponement. And if you don't, if you do not postpone, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| can answer my questions about the substance of timeline and other things. Ms. Ryder and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| Ms. Fugate. Okay, so specific to the postponement, this conversation about baseball and the rumors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| and the public, pro baseball, not for baseball, caveat, I've only been to two baseball games in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| my whole life. It has been going around for years. And on one hand, I'd like to put our community out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6555)|
| 1:49:22| of its misery. There's going to be numbers and we're going to talk about this and it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| going to be good for us or it is going to be good for us. So my question in terms of a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| if you go ahead and you do the sports authority because you get our approval and you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| county commissions next Monday, because if that doesn't happen, it doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| then what's your time frame if you got approval tonight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6581)|
| 1:49:50| does that give us time to have a workshop so we can really get answer system questions and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| about how a community benefits agreement happens, how it happened in Nashville, how it happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6595)|
| 1:50:02| in other cities, in other states, how I really, we need to look at how other states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6602)|
| 1:50:10| ended up upside down with stadiums. We need to look at how other cities, municipality states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6610)|
| 1:50:16| did well with them. I think there's a lot of discussion to be had. I will agree with Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| Parker on that, but I feel like we've been putting this elephant in the corner and not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| it for two years. So I'm tired of people telling me not to vote about baseball when I don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6627)|
| 1:50:34| have a proposal other than what Mr. Boyd has pitched for, no pun intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6634)|
| 1:50:40| And Marie, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| That's a long question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| What's the time frame if it's voted on tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| So I guess the question is, if we postpone the approval or the sports authority does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6648)|
| 1:50:57| what is the pros and cons of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| It's difficult to move forward with discussions without knowing that we have financing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| on the table. So it will be very challenging for us to move forward without knowing whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6665)|
| 1:51:15| council and commission will be willing to establish a sports authority. If a sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| authority is established, that provides us with a piece of information that we can then bring back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| to the table for some internal discussions between the city, the county, and the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| so that we can bring some information forward for a workshop and public deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6693)|
| 1:51:41| I would say, within the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| So our hope is to really begin the deliberation in earnest in the beginning of 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6706)|
| 1:51:53| with Councilwoman Ryder, but without knowing how this council would like to proceed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6713)|
| 1:52:02| establishing a sports authority, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be obtuse, but it is a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| bit more challenging to answer the question. It's the sticking point that we ran into with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| even planning a workshop, because it's like, we don't know what to discuss without knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| what tools we have in our toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Yes, there's lots of questions. I have a lot, the public has a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6745)|
| 1:52:33| and we need to get those answers. To me, kind of what the discussion about the postponement boils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| down to is, can implementing a sports authority begin to help us answer those questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6759)|
| 1:52:47| That's what I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| Yes, my answer to that is yes, and yet it doesn't commit us to anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| and it doesn't, and we can schedule a workshop for Council in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| Well, if the committing, if the implementing of a sports authority will get us further down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| of helping answer questions for us and the public, and it's not costing us any money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6785)|
| 1:53:12| and we can not go forward, you know, they can't build a stadium without us voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6792)|
| 1:53:21| So, I would be, I'm not convinced that a postponement at this initial stage is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6801)|
| 1:53:32| I just don't see what kind of purposes serve. I've got as many doubts probably as anybody has about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| the balance of public benefit versus city investment and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6818)|
| 1:53:45| And I guess just to get to the very end of this, that's what it's going to all boil down to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| It's going to be whether or not this investment that we are going to be confronted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| is going to pay dividends to the citizenry of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| But I want answers, and if doing this initial stage that's not going to cost us any money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6841)|
| 1:54:09| will help us get answers and help the public get answers, I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| I don't see the benefit in postponing it. And we can go ahead and schedule our workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| and start this process. This thing, as Councilwoman Riders talked about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| these issues have been floated around for years. Let's get on with it. And if we see it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6865)|
| 1:54:32| going to work, then we can stop it. We have the authority to stop it. And if it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| benefit the public, I will try to stop it. So, anyway, that's my pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas. We're still discussing the motion to postpone this parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| I just wanted to clarify, you know, why I made the motion. Before we even talk about the financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| I want to have a clear understanding of the role of the Sports Authority and how that limits our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| role. Because we, it is obvious from the discussion tonight that there are several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| members of the City Council who would like to be able to ensure certain public benefits through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| this project. It is also clear to me, at least, that our counterparts in the county do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6913)|
| 1:55:23| the same priorities that the City Council has. So, I want to be very clear before we make a joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6923)|
| 1:55:29| agreement on a major economic development initiative, not only that we are forming an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6929)|
| 1:55:37| institution that will be of the most benefit to our community, not just economically, but in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6937)|
| 1:55:47| of the other outcomes we seek from this. And we have not had that conversation. I'm still confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6947)|
| 1:55:54| after my last question on this procurement process. And I would like a little clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6954)|
| 1:56:01| before we form this institution jointly, and it becomes much harder to alter the makeup of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6961)|
| 1:56:09| institution moving forward. Thank you, Ms. Parker. If the motion to postpone fails, then Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6969)|
| 1:56:15| members can ask more questions about the Sports Authority. Any further discussion on the motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| postpone? Okay, Mr. Johnson, would you please do a roll call vote on the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6981)|
| 1:56:30| The motion to postpone until after a workshop is my understanding. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| Councilwoman Parker? Yes. Councilman Ryder? No. Councilman Roberto? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=6996)|
| 1:56:45| Councilman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| You're muted, ma'am. Yes, I'd like to postpone. Councilman Smith? No. Councilman Testerman? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7010)|
| 1:57:00| Councilman Thomas? No. Councilman Fugitt? No. Vice Mayor McKenzie? No. Okay, the motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7020)|
| 1:57:09| fails 7-2. We're back to the original motion, which is a motion to approve the establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| of Sports Authority. Ms. Fugitt, do you have a question? Thank you. My question is, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7035)|
| 1:57:23| the concern about what the City would like in the agreement. My understanding is whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7043)|
| 1:57:31| goes into the Sports Authority would have to be agreed to by the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| since this is going to be a joint Sports Authority. So the only way we totally control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| everything is if it is a City Sports Authority, which means there's no ability for the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7062)|
| 1:57:50| tax proceeds or their willingness to invest and it goes away, and then it becomes a City-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| project, correct? Can someone answer that for me? Yes, that's correct. And collaboration is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7076)|
| 1:58:04| Yes, collaboration is very hard. There's a lot of us every week, every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7084)|
| 1:58:12| So that's one of my concerns about us getting too prescriptive about the development of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7092)|
| 1:58:21| Sports Authority. I think once the public meetings happen and the collaborative conversation happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7101)|
| 1:58:28| that's where some of those joint things can be decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| because whatever we want in the Sports Authority must be agreed to by the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| correct? Okay, thank you. Okay, Council Members, any further questions? Ms. Parker and then Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7118)|
| 1:58:49| Ryder. I still have about 30 minutes left. Okay, so back to the procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7129)|
| 1:59:01| For the sports stadium, the Sports Authority would be over the development process for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7141)|
| 1:59:10| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7150)|
| 1:59:17| Council Member Parker, I know it's frustrating not to get yes or no answers, but that hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7157)|
| 1:59:24| been decided yet. If other similar projects, the manner of undertaking them is followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7164)|
| 1:59:33| the answer is yes, that the Sports Authority, for example, in the MLS stadium that is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| done right now in Nashville, the Sports Authority is the entity that is doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| construction procurement process for that stadium. What would be the alternative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7183)|
| 1:59:51| Well, theoretically, if you all decide you don't want to form a Sports Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| either the city or the county, if they chose to do so, could do it on their own. It goes back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| Council Member Fugate's point about whether that ends somewhat the possible collaboration between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7199)|
| 2:00:06| the two entities. Another alternative would be for one or the other to do it and try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7206)|
| 2:00:13| get the other one still to collaborate, even though they're not involved in the procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| process. That's a possibility from a legal perspective. Again, it undermines the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7217)|
| 2:00:26| of collaboration, but it legally could be achieved that way. What I'm referring to is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7226)|
| 2:00:33| if the Sports Authority is approved and we are moving forward with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7233)|
| 2:00:41| with a Sports Authority. I'm not talking about the city acting independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| the county acting independently. Help me understand what it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7245)|
| 2:00:49| for the Sports Authority to lead on that procurement process for a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| So what it would look like is the first procurement process would have to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| What is the best method to achieve the lowest cost quality result? That would need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| determined likely by the Sports Authority in consultation with county procurement and city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| procurement. That decision would need to be made. The negotiating team would need to finalize a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7272)|
| 2:01:20| lease with the team. We'd have to finalize a financial package to present to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| and then it would all be coming back to you, as well as intermediate reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| as well as a workshop along the way. But a final, the most significant vote that you all would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7290)|
| 2:01:35| likely be asked to undertake would be whether you support a funding agreement for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| If you're dissatisfied with the procurement process, dissatisfied with the team's responsiveness to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7300)|
| 2:01:47| request to support the community, you could vote against the funding agreement, and that would then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| end the ability of the Sports Authority to finance the stadium. So ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7312)|
| 2:01:59| the ability of this project, the financing to move forward, will be tied to a vote by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| body and by county commission at some point if you both move forward in a collaborative manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7326)|
| 2:02:13| Just to clarify a little bit, Ms. Parker, if you all approve the Sports Authority tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| the next thing that I would bring to you all is a slate of seven members that Mayor Jacobs and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| bring collectively to you and commission to vote on who's going to be on the Sports Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| and you would have the right to vote up or down on that. But it would be a collaborative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| Those seven people would be people that I work with, Mayor Jacobs and other people to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| who the best people to be to serve on that, who reflect the needs of what we hope to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| there. So this is, like I tried to articulate, this is just the first step that would come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7367)|
| 2:02:56| you. And also, before we bring that slate to you, we can have a work session to have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| discussions when it's not a voting meeting as well. So that would be, you all have more things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7383)|
| 2:03:12| to vote on is what I'm saying. Thank you for that info. Thank you. Okay. So my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7392)|
| 2:03:21| so it sounds similar to, you know, these other independent bodies that we've developed where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7401)|
| 2:03:28| our only leverage that we'll have is when it comes to funding. And it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7408)|
| 2:03:38| what we're not going to be brought into. It doesn't seem like there's at any point where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7418)|
| 2:03:46| can, you know, out of editing the current charter and sending that edit over to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7426)|
| 2:03:57| County Commission also for their approval, without requiring the Sports Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| to itself require agreements with the community, or require some sort of public benefit as defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7443)|
| 2:04:14| by the community, then we have no ability to influence those negotiations, except for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7454)|
| 2:04:26| except for a voting up and down their funding. Is that what I'm hearing you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7466)|
| 2:04:38| The, that will be the ultimate vote that would come back to this body, there almost certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7478)|
| 2:04:45| will be other votes relative to the public infrastructure around the stadium, as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7485)|
| 2:04:52| the way that the ownership of the development around the stadium, will there be any incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7492)|
| 2:04:59| relative to the private development side of things, those other votes almost certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| will come back to this body. But ultimately, the funding, the right to approve the overall project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7506)|
| 2:05:14| and the financial strength of the project, the manner and the way it's being conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7514)|
| 2:05:19| would be your opportunity to say, look, I just am dissatisfied with this would come when it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7519)|
| 2:05:25| presented to you for funding, that's correct. Okay, and to clarify something you said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7525)|
| 2:05:32| the Sports Authority would be focused on the stadium, but the private development around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7532)|
| 2:05:39| the stadium would be led by the gym development group, completely separate from anything having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7539)|
| 2:05:47| to do with the stadium. There certainly would need to be easements and things like that for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7547)|
| 2:05:57| stadium and the private development to work in harmony with each other. But yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| other than that, they would be two separate legal entities. But the overall financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7561)|
| 2:06:08| package that eventually would be submitted to you all, unless there's a significant private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| component to the development, I don't think this will be a successful project. So I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7573)|
| 2:06:21| they are very much interrelated from an economic perspective, but you're definitely correct that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| they are segregated from a legal perspective. And so the initial numbers that I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| and it seems like you're talking about the same numbers, indicate that in order for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7591)|
| 2:06:38| to be successful, just like you said, these are not affordable housing units that are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7598)|
| 2:06:45| discussed for this private development around the stadium, correct? I don't know that. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7605)|
| 2:06:53| I'm sorry. Somebody else may be able to comment on that. I don't know if they plan the affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| housing units in this development. Councilman Parker, the housing that you're describing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7617)|
| 2:07:05| is private development. And so that's, I mean, I know that there have been presentations to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7625)|
| 2:07:12| council members and to members of the administration. Some of that has evolved. And so as far as what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| kinds of development happens on the private side of the development, on the privately owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| property, I don't know that the city is in a position to speak to that. Really? Okay. Because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7644)|
| 2:07:33| usually we negotiate with developers when they're part of a project and there's a public benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7653)|
| 2:07:40| that we'd like to see. Especially as I imagine is going to happen in order to make this a viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7660)|
| 2:07:49| financially viable project, they're going to come back to us for money. And as soon as we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| talking about public benefits, that price tag is going to increase. So that 60 million that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| have been hearing is just a fraction of what I imagine that they're going to come back to us with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7679)|
| 2:08:06| if we keep pushing for a large public benefits from this project. I just have a few more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| and then I'll turn it over to other council members. Okay. After Ms. Parker finishes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| we'll go to Ms. Tesserman and then Ms. Ryder. Okay. So I heard you mention earlier you already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7696)|
| 2:08:24| have an estimate for 300,000 annual income and state sales tax that is projected from this stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7704)|
| 2:08:36| Is that correct? This team is actually estimating higher, Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| more in the 450 to 500 range. I'm trying to be conservative based on existing double A baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| stadiums. So that's why I've used that number. But yes, that's what I mentioned as a likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7727)|
| 2:08:54| estimate. But I think it's on the low side. And it does seem like a lower number. It certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7734)|
| 2:09:01| doesn't seem like an amount that would be sufficient to cover the annual debt payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7741)|
| 2:09:08| on a large project like that. No. It's probably 10% of the debt service on a project of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7748)|
| 2:09:18| And so just initially, are we thinking that you mentioned earlier that any shortfalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7758)|
| 2:09:27| have to be paid from non-property tax revenues on this stadium? We have very few tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7767)|
| 2:09:37| in our city. I believe at the County Commission meeting, there was a discussion of hotel-motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| taxes. Is that the go-to revenue stream for this project? That was the county's hotel-motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7783)|
| 2:09:52| taxes. What they have been banding about is their possible revenue stream if they are required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7792)|
| 2:09:59| make up a stream if they have to make up shortfalls for the project. And please tell me to stop if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7799)|
| 2:10:07| this is not helpful to you. But the sales tax revenues from the stadium would be coupled with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7807)|
| 2:10:16| a number of other revenue sources, likely a significant payment of rent from the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7816)|
| 2:10:23| hopefully sales tax revenues from adjacent properties. Again, that's what we would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7823)|
| 2:10:29| on legislatively. And that's what we would be working on bringing back to you, the ultimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| other revenue sources that we hope to negotiate and try to get the best deal that we can for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7834)|
| 2:10:40| city and the county that we would present to you all that you can decide whether you're satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| with it. Certainly, my hope and my goal is by the time the negotiating is all done, that we're able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| to narrow the likely exposure to the city, the county to certainly less than half of the projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7852)|
| 2:10:59| debt surface for the stadium. One reason I wanted to clarify that is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7859)|
| 2:11:10| that was something that concerned me because I know that we have a large amount of debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7870)|
| 2:11:16| with the convention center that we're working to pay off with that hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| that's dedicated to that. And so if that were included in any sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| proposed financing for the stadium, we would need to also take into account how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7886)|
| 2:11:34| impacts our future ability to pay off our debts and if that slows down our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| timeline for paying off those debts. Let's see. Ms. Parker, there's a few other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7899)|
| 2:11:48| with questions. Usually, I think it's, I think officially in Robert's Rules, like it's usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7908)|
| 2:11:58| one question per council member. We have a loose interpretation of that, but if you want to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| someone else have a turn while you're in between things. Sure, I can pause and come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7924)|
| 2:12:13| Okay. Council Member Testerman, I think you were next. Yeah, I would just like to say that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| know, with this resolution, I mean, we can't get a proposal to council, we can't get a proposal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7939)|
| 2:12:25| the community until we have a sports authority. You know, it's been clear that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7945)|
| 2:12:32| great deal of due process that still has to happen, including a workshop. And so at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| I would like to call for the vote to move forward and then reserve further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7958)|
| 2:12:43| We all have a lot of questions for and reserve them for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7963)|
| 2:12:50| Okay, there's a motion on the floor. Are you making a motion, Ms. Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| I am. Okay, there's a motion on the floor to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| So that does not allow any debate, do we just vote on the motion to call for the question, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| then go to a vote on the first motion. So need a second. Is there a second on the motion to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7986)|
| 2:13:12| the question? I'll second. Okay, motion made by Council Member Testerman, seconded by Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=7992)|
| 2:13:21| Member Thomas. Please conduct a roll call vote on the call to the question. Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8001)|

| 2:13:41| I think it's ridiculous that you all are shutting down questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| It's out of order, Ms. Parker. I know I'm out of order. Absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| no, I'm out of order. I vote no. Okay, please continue. I think that's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| Council Member Ryder? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8034)|

| 2:14:12| So the call for the question passes. Is that 7-2? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| Okay, so now we're back to the original motion on creating a sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8056)|
| 2:14:21| Please conduct a roll call vote. Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| Yes. Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8064)|

| 2:14:38| You're muted, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8078)|

| 2:15:06| Okay, motion carries 8-1. Council, we've been meeting for over two hours. I'd like to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| a 10-minute recess. We'll reconvene at 8-25. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8112)|
| 2:15:23| Okay, Council Members, it's 8-25. I'm not sure what that clock was for. We said 8-25, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8123)|
| 2:15:33| Yes, ma'am. It was counting down to 8-25. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| Okay, thank you. We'll give Council Members a couple more minutes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8138)|
| 2:15:47| unmute and show themselves when they're back from things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8147)|
| 2:16:07| Okay. All right, Council Members, let's reconvene. Recess is over. I'll restart the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8167)|
| 2:16:25| We're on Item 11D. Mr. Johnson, could you read that for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8185)|

| 2:16:51| Second. Motion made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| Council, I just want to know, just comment that this is the next installment, as many of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8217)|
| 2:17:04| in a long series of major investments in the city that the City and City Council has committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8224)|
| 2:17:10| affordable housing projects. The Austin Homes project is one that I'm particularly excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| about because it's a major expansion of affordable housing immediately adjacent to our downtown core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8235)|
| 2:17:21| accessible to good jobs, educational opportunities, and countless other amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| So it used to be 129 units, and the new Austin Homes development will feature at least 368 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8245)|
| 2:17:34| potentially up to 420. So just to reiterate, it was 129, and it's going to be at least 368 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8254)|
| 2:17:43| maybe as many as 420. So that's a lot of more additional affordable housing in a very great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8263)|
| 2:17:52| location. And maybe up to 420 new units, and 105 are scheduled to be open by the end of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8272)|
| 2:18:00| So this time next year, we may be celebrating a ribbon cutting at the opening of the first phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| of Austin Homes 312. So this is housing for families with a diversity of incomes, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| income caps and rent restrictions on every single unit to ensure this community remains accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8292)|
| 2:18:18| and affordable. So I appreciate your continued support to help make this project possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| Thank you. Any questions or comments on item 11-D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8302)|

| 2:18:43| I don't know if Ben Bentley is on. I think it's, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| Yeah, Mayor, if I could respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| Yeah, so it's 8.75. There was a 4.25 million commitment in the last capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| and then the 4.5 million for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=8336)|

| 2:32:29| Mr. Cannon, could you answer her questions, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| I believe that is correct, ma'am. The purpose of this resolution is to allow our co-location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9153)|
| 2:32:41| if you will, on AT&T poles. This started off as a streetlight matter when we took over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9161)|
| 2:32:48| streetlights as a city. Going forward, this will have to do with the ATMS projects that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9168)|

| 2:33:10| yes. But that's one of the things that we're fighting as a city right now, and I call it pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9190)|
| 2:33:17| pollution, if you will. The cost that we're expending here on a per attachment basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9197)|
| 2:33:26| we can't pay for itself if it's ours. And so it's been a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9206)|
| 2:33:34| great cooperative effort in both ways, serving AT&T as well as AT&T allowing the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9214)|
| 2:33:43| to do what it is proposing. And I'd like to say the engineering department did it. It's on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9223)|

| 2:34:18| And I know this is a lot of looking into the future. We don't know what it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9258)|

| 2:34:26| the law department. Ms. Healy, did you, I don't think it's a parks and rec question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9266)|

| 2:34:38| Mr. Swanson. Well, I don't really think it would impact any agreement we would reach with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9278)|
| 2:34:46| to broadband. That would be really a separate subject. And we could continue to engage in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9286)|
| 2:34:53| contract with AT&T for attachments on poles without having that interfere with any opportunities we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9293)|
| 2:34:59| might have to engage in broadband service either with AT or with AT&T or any other particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9299)|

| 2:45:11| And I'm wondering, is there overlap between these or is there a different, I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9911)|
| 2:45:17| they already have some equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| Chief Thomas, could you answer Ms. Singh's question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9919)|
| 2:45:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| Council Member Singh, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| It's kind of correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9928)|
| 2:45:29| We work with MDC and the county and other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9929)|
| 2:45:33| We don't have equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| We just had to piece it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9935)|
| 2:45:36| This grant is specifically for equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| It would allow us to purchase equipment to do those drug take-backs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| And since we've been doing them, we've collected over 31,347 pounds of pills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9941)|
| 2:45:47| So that's a lot when you think of how many pills it takes to make one pound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| On those drug take-back events, we collect anywhere from 600 to 900 pounds each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9951)|
| 2:45:56| Plus, we have a box here at the police department, so we'd be able to buy more boxes with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9956)|
| 2:46:00| funds as well and put those secure boxes in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9960)|

| 2:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9968)|
| 2:46:09| It's something that we just didn't destroy the drugs locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9969)|
| 2:46:14| It was sent out or something, and now we're going to have the ability to do it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9978)|
| 2:46:19| Actually, it still has to get instruction orders, and we do destroy the drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9979)|
| 2:46:23| This is just to collect equipment to collect them, phones, a trailer to haul all the garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9983)|
| 2:46:32| bins and secure areas that we put them in while we have them here, and then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9992)|
| 2:46:36| to store them at the police department until we can get that to come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=9999)|

| 2:47:48| I want to speak to this resolution, if I may, for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10068)|
| 2:47:54| There has been a lot of collaboration that's gone into this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10074)|
| 2:48:00| I just want to make clear that this resolution was not thrown together without giving a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10080)|
| 2:48:07| of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10087)|
| 2:48:08| And I want to say thank you, first of all, to those who have been fighting for racial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10088)|
| 2:48:14| justice and restoration for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10094)|
| 2:48:18| Long before I came along, people such as Mr. Zimbabwe Mutabu, I also even like to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10098)|
| 2:48:26| that my dad was a person who fought for racial justice and many, many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10106)|
| 2:48:32| Also, to all those who have sat in this Council seat and who have been people of color, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| have been in local government here in Knoxville, the countless people that contributed to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10117)|
| 2:48:44| resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10124)|
| 2:48:45| It was a collective effort with way too many people to name right now in this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10125)|
| 2:48:54| But I do want to recognize the Faith Leaders Initiative, the faith community, just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10134)|
| 2:49:01| overwhelming support for this resolution and the diverse support for this resolution was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10141)|
| 2:49:08| something that was very surprising to me, if I can just be really transparent right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10148)|
| 2:49:14| now, to see that there were so many people who believed in this resolution, believed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| in what this resolution means as far as apologizing, acknowledging, and recommending some actionable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10160)|
| 2:49:27| items that we, as a Council, can put in place that will improve the plight of Black African| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10167)|
| 2:49:37| Americans here in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| We all know that there is a 42% poverty rate that's been recorded here in Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10179)|
| 2:49:45| in the Black community, and we are now at a point where we have a resolution that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10185)|
| 2:49:50| actually help us move from generational poverty to actually providing opportunities and access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10190)|
| 2:49:57| for people to now start looking at generational wealth building here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10197)|
| 2:50:03| I also want to just confirm that the time is now for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| There have been so many people who have shared with me that they have thought about putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10207)|
| 2:50:12| forth resolutions, and I can guarantee you, if I had brought this resolution last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10212)|
| 2:50:17| the year before that, the timing would not have been right for us as a city, us as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10217)|
| 2:50:23| country, or as a body to be able to receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| So, I also want to thank the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| She and I have had preliminary conversation about the task force and about this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10231)|
| 2:50:37| specifically about how the task force potentially could look at and look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10237)|
| 2:50:42| So, I briefly want to state in regard to the task force that there could be a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10242)|
| 2:50:50| that is brought forth to my colleagues as it relates to what is the structure of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| task force, the number of people who will serve on the task force, the terms, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10254)|
| 2:51:00| how the task force will be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10260)|
| 2:51:01| While I have some recommendations, this is a collective effort because we as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10261)|
| 2:51:06| would be in agreement that we believe that this task force, this African American Equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10266)|
| 2:51:11| Restoration Task Force, would be the right step to be able to bring a collective body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10271)|
| 2:51:16| of people together that will specifically look at the disparities in the African American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| community, look at the programs that are already in agencies and nonprofits, and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| are the gaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| Where are some of those things that are missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| Is it capacity building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| Is it additional outreach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| Those are some of the things that the task force will be charged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| In the resolution, we talk about that there will be measurable outcomes that they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| look for and that they will track and also report back to us as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10300)|
| 2:51:46| I also want to be clear that for the financial commitment, which I think is a huge concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10306)|
| 2:51:51| for a lot of people when they hear it, that that is actually a financial commitment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10311)|
| 2:51:57| could be satisfied through federal, local, and state grants with the help of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10317)|
| 2:52:02| administration, also private investment, as well as considering city dollars that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10322)|
| 2:52:09| go into that funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| And so, I just ask that my colleagues will have an open mind and know that we have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10331)|
| 2:52:16| that are signed up to speak, and you guys may have some questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10336)|
| 2:52:21| But I realize that there are some people that will just never understand why this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10341)|
| 2:52:26| is important and what it means to the Black community in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10346)|
| 2:52:30| Some people may think this is just another symbolic apology or we're just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10350)|
| 2:52:36| putting more money in an investment that they feel is not going to really amount to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10356)|
| 2:52:42| But it's so much greater than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| This is a moment in our history for true healing and restoration that can begin in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| the African-American community here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| And so, 2020, when people, generations to come, think back on 2020 in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10372)|
| 2:52:58| not only will they reflect back on a global health pandemic that has taken a lot of lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10378)|
| 2:53:04| in our city and across our country, but they're also going to look back at 2020 and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10384)|
| 2:53:10| going to realize that there was also a racial pandemic that was occurring in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10390)|
| 2:53:16| And they're also going to look back in time and they're going to see the names, George| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10396)|
| 2:53:22| Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many countless people of color whose lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10402)|
| 2:53:29| were taken from them simply because they were Black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| And so, while we know that all lives matter, 2020 actually affirmed that Black lives matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| So, that is the end of my opening statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| I don't know if we want to take questions now, Mayor, what the protocol would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| Do we have a public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| Well, there's 16 people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10427)|
| 2:53:52| So, you know, that's well exceeds the council members' rules for a number of people speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10432)|
| 2:54:01| in a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10441)|
| 2:54:02| So, you all have to decide if you wish to suspend your rules or modify them in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10442)|
| 2:54:09| Now's the time to make that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| Is there a motion, Ms. Huguett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10452)|

| 2:56:04| that exist in this community, especially those facing African Americans who have, in so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10564)|

| 2:57:00| to three minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10620)|

| 2:57:15| You're being asked to pass a resolution expressing mutual understanding and intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10635)|
| 2:57:23| Passage of this resolution will be a historic step bringing this community together, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10643)|
| 2:57:30| the resolution does not provide any money to end poverty in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10650)|
| 2:57:35| In fact, the resolution specifically looks forward to raising money from private and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10655)|
| 2:57:41| federal sources, which is not to say that Knoxville should not appropriate any funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10661)|
| 2:57:46| later on, but this resolution does not do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10666)|
| 2:57:51| Upon its passage, much work only remains to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10671)|
| 2:57:57| To me, the resolution is mostly about us as a community addressing intractable generational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10677)|
| 2:58:07| black poverty, also called the wealth gap, which exists in Knoxville, and also addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10687)|
| 2:58:14| inhumane past treatment blacks have received here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10694)|
| 2:58:19| This poverty and mistreatment are not unique to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10699)|
| 2:58:24| They are, in fact, endemic across America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10704)|
| 2:58:29| But black poverty is different than poverty generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| It was born in the involuntary servitude of slavery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10713)|
| 2:58:37| It came of age in the decades of lynching and segregation by law, and it survives in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10717)|
| 2:58:43| a hardened silo of racial prejudice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| The median net worth of a black family in 2016 was 10 times less than the median net| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10727)|

| 2:59:17| And the ways that families normally build wealth in America is in the same condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10757)|
| 2:59:26| But in addition, blacks in Knoxville have suffered through the same treatment that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10766)|
| 2:59:33| caused this wealth gap across America, including 22 percent of the population of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10773)|
| 2:59:44| being in slavery before the Civil War, including lynchings, the Red Summer of 1919, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10784)|

| 3:00:05| which had an oversized effect here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| So I hope you can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10809)|

| 3:00:42| has prompted U.S. policymakers in other cities to reckon with this country's history of racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10842)|
| 3:00:47| in a manner we have not seen for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10847)|
| 3:00:50| Many cities are offering resolutions to right past wrongs, and it's time for Knoxville to follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10850)|
| 3:00:55| One of the most telling and enduring reminders of the effects of urban renewal in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10855)|
| 3:01:00| is the wealth gap that currently exists between Blacks and whites in our community to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| Knoxville once had a thriving Black community, bustling with Black-owned businesses, churches, and homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10864)|
| 3:01:10| And in order to make way for urban renewal projects, over 2,500 Black families were displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10870)|
| 3:01:15| Black business owners' dreams were derailed as the renewal projects raised their businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| to make way for new infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| And with its 42 percent poverty rate, the Black community is still feeling the effects of urban renewal today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10881)|
| 3:01:27| As you all know, wealth is vital for individuals looking to purchase a home, start a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10887)|
| 3:01:33| help children attend college, and secure retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10893)|
| 3:01:37| Without major intervention, the wealth gap in Knoxville will continue to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10897)|
| 3:01:41| This resolution is a chance and an intervention that will even the gap in our city's wealth landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10901)|
| 3:01:47| Righting the wrong is not complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| However, it is often where the conversation ends, as it requires a sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10909)|
| 3:01:54| This decision will require sacrifice from every council member who may vote yes to this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10914)|
| 3:01:59| despite being in a position where they may benefit from the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10919)|
| 3:02:02| However, I want to point out this is an issue whose time has come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| An apology is simply not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| I would like to share an excerpt from Dr. Martin Luther King's letter from a Birmingham jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10929)|
| 3:02:14| And a little background is Dr. King was jailed due to new legislation passed by a circuit court judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10934)|
| 3:02:19| that issued an injunction against parading, demonstrating, boycotting, and picketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| Dr. King didn't comply with the ruling and was incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10943)|
| 3:02:26| And he wrote a letter in response to a newspaper article from eight white clergymen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10946)|

| 3:02:33| In the article the clergyman wrote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| we recognize the natural impatience of people who feel their hopes are slow being realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10955)|
| 3:02:39| But we are convinced that these demonstrations are unwise and untimely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| And here's his response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| I've almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10964)|
| 3:02:48| and the stride toward freedom is not the white citizen's counselor or the Ku Klux Klan-er,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10968)|
| 3:02:52| but the white moderate who's more devoted to order than to justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10972)|
| 3:02:56| who prefers a negative peace, which is the absence of tension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10976)|
| 3:03:00| to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| who constantly says I agree with you in the goal you seek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10983)|
| 3:03:06| but I can't agree with your methods of direct action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| who patternistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10989)|
| 3:03:13| who lives by the myth of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a more convenient season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10995)|
| 3:03:19| So, in conclusion, I urge City Council to vote yes for this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| as it stands to make a positive impact for all Knox civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11003)|
| 3:03:27| It is important for the economic health and growth of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11007)|
| 3:03:30| and the retention and attraction of young talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11010)|
| 3:03:33| who often leave our town for better, more equitable environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11013)|
| 3:03:37| Thank you, Ms. Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| Next person signed up to speak is Mr. Charles Albawi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| Mr. Albawi, are you still on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11023)|
| 3:03:49| Yes, I am. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11029)|
| 3:03:52| Yes, we can. You can go ahead and start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| We have your name and address from your previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11035)|
| 3:03:58| All right. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| I sincerely appreciate this resolution being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11040)|
| 3:04:07| You know, this is a step in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11047)|
| 3:04:10| but this does not complete the journey for the Black American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| who has long struggled for freedom and opportunity and justice in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11054)|
| 3:04:21| This is just a mere step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| and we would be wise to use more definite terms to address the rest of this journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11064)|
| 3:04:34| So many people have fought so long and so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| and given their lives for this struggle to reach this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11078)|
| 3:04:44| and they gladly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11084)|
| 3:04:48| They are thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| But we should just not leave it and be happy that they're okay with crumbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11090)|
| 3:04:56| This is admittedly a proposal that doesn't offer concrete money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11096)|
| 3:05:03| and the reality is money may not solve your individual problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11103)|
| 3:05:08| but when we have a budget of $400 million of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11108)|
| 3:05:13| and we can see that some of the highest concentrated areas of poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11113)|
| 3:05:18| of violence, of substance abuse, of poor education systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11118)|
| 3:05:23| is in areas where Black people are concentrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| we would be wise to invest in those areas to end these generational cycles of poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11127)|
| 3:05:33| substance abuse, violence, and the mental health stigmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11133)|
| 3:05:37| So much happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| It creates a cycle that cannot be broken unless we come together as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11139)|
| 3:05:47| Black, white, Latinx, LGBTQ, everyone has to see that more has to be done to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11147)|
| 3:05:59| So I would kindly request that the council listen to Councilor Amelia Parker's proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11159)|
| 3:06:07| and amendments to this to strengthen it, because it must be strengthened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11167)|
| 3:06:13| and you must be willing to move forward on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| If you're willing to give concrete money to a baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| you should be willing to give concrete money to those who have been oppressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11181)|
| 3:06:26| And if they are willing to ask for money from us, the taxpayers, for their one personal project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11186)|
| 3:06:33| then they should be willing to give their personal money to our community who needs it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11193)|
| 3:06:39| in the very area that they want to propose their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11199)|
| 3:06:43| This is not a hard dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11203)|
| 3:06:49| This should have been done a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11209)|
| 3:06:52| We have had Democratic mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| If the Democratic Party cared about us, about the Black community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11214)|
| 3:06:59| this would have been done long before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| Thank you, Mr. Albaughy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| That concludes your three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11224)|
| 3:07:07| Next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11227)|
| 3:07:10| Sorry, Ms. Scheib, I believe has rejoined us if we want to hear from her now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| Ms. Scheib, thank you for suspending the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11234)|
| 3:07:19| You have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11239)|
| 3:07:24| Okay, we're going to try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11244)|
| 3:07:26| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11246)|
| 3:07:27| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11247)|
| 3:07:28| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| I'm very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11250)|
| 3:07:31| I'm very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11251)|
| 3:07:32| My name is Vivian Scheib, 3615 Martin Luther King Avenue, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11252)|
| 3:07:37| I appreciate the three minutes just to share a thought as we go forward with this historic time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11257)|
| 3:07:43| I want to tell you a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11263)|
| 3:07:47| Once upon a time, decades ago, a baby was born, not in a manger or in snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11267)|
| 3:07:53| The baby was born on a summit, they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| You know the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11276)|
| 3:07:58| He was born right up from gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| Right from his beginning, the child would suffer many ills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11280)|
| 3:08:04| The first one was hunger, for his bottle was empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11284)|
| 3:08:08| His mommy bowed her head, for the food desert was vast and it was miles to a store that didn't cost ten times more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11288)|
| 3:08:16| The child would grow up with friends who would not, for they lived in a gun zone and many were shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11296)|
