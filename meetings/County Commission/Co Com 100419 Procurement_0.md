| 0:00:05| Okay, I'm going to call the Procurement Procedures Committee to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=5)|
| 0:00:12| And clerk, if you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=12)|
| 0:00:14| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=14)|

| 0:00:24| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=24)|
| 0:00:25| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| We have three present out of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=26)|
| 0:00:28| So we do have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| I want to thank Commissioner Wright for announcing a few times during the Finance Committee that we had this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=32)|
| 0:00:42| immediately following, so I appreciate that, reminding commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| Clerk, if you'll read the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=48)|
| 0:00:51| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| amending sections 2-736 and 2-738 of the Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 9 Procurement Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=54)|
| 0:01:01| to require our approval by the County Commission on Cooperative Procurement Agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=61)|
| 0:01:05| in any agreement for the cooperative use of supplies or services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| Ordinance number 0-08-5-101, adopted June 23, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| This is ordinance 1-02 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=76)|
| 0:01:23| I thought it was 1-01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| Okay, 1-02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Do we hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| Or do you want to hear a report first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| Let's hear a report from Hugh or John, whoever wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| I provided last Thursday in each of the Procurement Subcommittee members' box basically an impact study of the proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=100)|
| 0:01:51| And I'd like to preface this by saying if I could understand what we were trying to accomplish here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=111)|
| 0:01:59| with these changes in the code because I think what our intent is in the change, what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=119)|
| 0:02:08| is not going to be accomplished by what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| So I'll start with Section 2-736, which addresses cooperative procurements that are authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=133)|
| 0:02:23| And basically what that does, it gives me, as the Purchasing Director, the authority to joint bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=143)|
| 0:02:34| enter into joint ventures with people like KUB, KCDC, and several of, well, numerous surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=154)|
| 0:02:46| In other words, intergovernmental entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Yes, for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| And it also affects our relationship with TEMA and FEMA because we are the contracting agency of record for East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=172)|
| 0:03:03| And that means I buy for volunteer fire departments, rural metro from time to time, UT Police Department, KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=183)|
| 0:03:16| just to name a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| And what will happen as a result of this type of a change is that every time that I recognize an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=200)|
| 0:03:31| to enter into an economies of scale acquisition by combining the needs of multiple agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=211)|
| 0:03:42| I would have to have the commission's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| This would affect school technology and you're talking about delaying a process maybe 30 to 60 days as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=226)|
| 0:04:01| What I think our intent here is to grab those agreements, those memorandums of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=241)|
| 0:04:11| those intergovernmental agreements between Knox County and maybe Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| or in the case of the Solway and get those in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| And I concur that those type of agreements never come through purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| They are between the using agency and the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| We never get involved unless we are copied or told that this has been incorporated into the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=275)|
| 0:04:43| So by changing this code, you're not going to impact what I think you're attempting to impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=283)|
| 0:04:52| You?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| What are your suggestions or what would be your suggestion to do the intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| I'm unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| What is the intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| There's a couple of avenues that I've been looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| And if you could give me, you know, a couple of weeks to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| and see how that is going to impact our code as well as trying to get to that intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=317)|
| 0:05:27| But I've got a couple of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| But what I was trying to do first is to put the brakes on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| and let you guys know what's going to happen if you approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| And, of course, that's just the first piece of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| And if I can interrupt one more time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| Have you had a chance to speak with Commissioner Pinkston to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| getting back to Commissioner Saunders' question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| what his intent is and try to come up with some avenues that would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| I spoke to Commissioner Pinkston two or three different times on this as well as Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| And I think it's been a couple of weeks ago I talked to Joe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| and I said I don't think we're going to arrive at the intent that we were intending to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=371)|
| 0:06:23| with the change in this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| But, you know, you're talking about affecting agreements that we enter into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| with national cooperatives that you guys already approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| I mean our agreements with the U.S. communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| the National Joint Purchasing Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| I mean these are things, these are agreements that you have already approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| that you're going to have to approve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| Mr. Chairman, if I could, not to interrupt, but you've got three issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| You've got a legal issue, a policy issue, and you've got a technical purchasing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| Maybe the answer is to defer this so Hugh and I and Commissioner Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| the three of us could meet because, again, you've got three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| I'm looking at it from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| Hugh is looking at it from his practical technical application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| and Commissioner Pinkston is looking at it from a policy standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| And I just don't, you know, the idea is to give you something that's cogent, that's reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| that's legally defensible and doesn't burden you every month with approving contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| some of which under emergency powers, et cetera, et cetera, time is of the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| But I'll defer to your wisdom on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Well, at a minimum, what we've been able to glean from some of our database analysis is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=452)|
| 0:07:42| that the commission, if you were to make all these changes you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| in the neighborhood of about 500 additional items per year that you will be hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| What's the problem that excited this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| I guess that would be a question for Commissioner Pinkston that you'd have to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| Commissioner Wright, do you have a motion to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| I was going to make a motion that in light of the unknowns that are facing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| that the procurement committee recommend to the full commission that this be deferred at least 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=496)|
| 0:08:29| while meetings take place to identify the cause or the problems that surround this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| So I would recommend to full commission that this be deferred at least 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| I'll second that, but I would like to ask John Troy or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| John, when we make these ordinance changes, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| there is a requirement on you to go back and look at the cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Now, I suspect you won't be doing that prior to a suggestion of change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| but I assume if we pass the ordinance on first reading, then before the second reading we would have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Is that the way it normally works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Yeah, that's the way that it's structured with the resolution, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| as opposed to providing fiscal impact of the proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| Well, in this case, since we now know at least this thing is in the talking stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| while you may not need to do a full study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| it might be helpful to us if we had some idea of the financial impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| Yeah, there will be, and I think Mr. Holt has got a good approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| Let's see what we're trying to accomplish and start there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| and there might be more than one way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Okay, just want to make a correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| The ordinance number should be 10-4-103, not 10-3-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=584)|
| 0:09:53| There's a typo on the agenda, just to make that technical correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Your motion then addressed both these ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| No, this is just the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| So we'll go through the second one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Okay, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Second item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| amending Sections 2-581 and 2-691 of the Knox County Code Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| Chapter 2, Article 9, Procurement Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| to require approval by the County Commissioner on all contracts exceeding $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| and all changes to existing contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| This is Ordinance 10-4-104 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=634)|
| 0:10:44| You, same sort of concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| Yeah, what you're talking about is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| previously approved contracts that have come before you that have escalation clauses in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| that are tied to the CPI, the PPI, or some other nationally known index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| This affects milk, fuel, petroleum-based products, lumber market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| And what happens in this process is annually these contracts are renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| Some of these contracts, about 90% of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| have an escalation clause that will allow them to go up the amount that's tied to the index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| A lot of times this doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| But regardless, this is going to come back before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| because you're talking about changes with a $0 amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| So, for example, technology contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Those are a term bid that run from year to year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| but technology changes every three to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| They're not allowed to change their pricing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| but they can change the technology itself with something that is as good or better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| That's a no-dollar change, but it is a change in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| So, therefore, we would be back down here getting your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| That's the kind of things you're talking about with this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| Mr. Law Director, do you see any legal aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| that maybe that we're not seeing as a problem with this particular ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| You know, likewise, sir, I think this is something that needs to be fleshed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| because, again, if you've got pending contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| and you need to issue a change and time is of the essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| you're either going to be inundated with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| or you're going to start having to call special meetings to modify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| So, I think, likewise, this fits into the original category of your first ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Same so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Same second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Sixty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Sixty-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| With nothing further, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100419procurement?start=777)|
