| 0:18:24| The overpass at Willow in the Old City is where registration is, and then the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1104)|

| 0:18:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| We'll move on to the addendum to the beer board agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Our first item is Deedee Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| My name is Love Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| I'm from 3700 Whittle Springs Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| So what is the latest update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| So the latest update is we've got the whole buildings done, ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| But the thing is, whenever the guy who came to do the final inspection, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| we need to get our parking lot done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| That's what it said in the blueprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| That's what he told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| But the thing is, our architect died, so we didn't really know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| So we got a quote on it, so we should be getting it done soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Oh, I think I've skipped some things and didn't quite go through the right order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| of things, so hang with me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| I guess, do I need to go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Officer Taylor, this has been a while, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| The only thing I can add is they'll need to do the cast class again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| and potentially a new background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| I would probably defer to you guys, but there hasn't been one done in over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| A new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Mr. Taylor, or I'm sorry, Mr. Bird, apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| Additionally to that, the Department of Agriculture approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| is the only thing really I'm needing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| So I believe the last time you guys were on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| you were still waiting on the Department of Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Was that 60 days ago maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| Are they not giving that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Because you said, Mr. Bird, in a message to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| that that was about temperatures of the refrigerators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| I think since the last deferral or the last extension, we've made progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| I believe then we wouldn't have had perhaps fire approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| and certainly inspections, but we've made progress there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| But I understand the cooler temperature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| they kind of have to check right when you're ready to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Everything else has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Mr. Patel, so when you guys went to go get your CO, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| and close out your permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| that's when you were told you needed to do the parking lot because it was in the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| And so you've got a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Do you know when that work is to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Whenever the weather gets better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| So if the weather stays good, we should be able to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Does anybody else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| Officer Taylor was telling us that you've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| you've gone more than a year without getting your background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| and taking the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| We need you to go ahead and do that again before you come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| If you're granted an extension, is that something you could agree to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| We'll get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1321)|

| 0:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Councilwoman McKenzie, your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you, chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Also, just in just reviewing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| I mean, this first application was in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| And we normally do not see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| Out this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| I mean, this is one off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Close to four years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| And so I don't know if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Yeah, I just think I just would caution us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| As it relates to precedences in these, in these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| I know we were giving people a lot of leniency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| There was COVID going on in some other things, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| Just something for us to keep in mind moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| I'm, I'm a little confused about the parking lot requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| And the not knowing about it for so long. And I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| Would require a conversation with someone in the building department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| to get some clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| Officer Taylor or Mr. Frost may have to fill me in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| When someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Or even Mr. Bird, when someone pays for the permit, that covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| The cost of the fingerprinting and the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Is it cask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| The cast is paid to the city and also, but I take the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Okay. And they pay the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| That the cost of that is 37 15. They pay the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| The.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| So if we're asking them to do fingerprints again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| and the cast class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| they're going to have to pay for each of those over again. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| So the only thing by giving an additional extension is they're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| not paying for the permit again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| For the actual beer permit, Mr. Bird, you want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| That initial application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| And then there's a publication fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| That covers the, the application being listed in the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| Of course, the extension items aren't listed in the public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| monthly anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| So that's no further expense on the city's part in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| But that all occurs just the one time when the applicant applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| I gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| So in an example like this where we've given it so many extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| we just are at a loss on this one because of the public notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| Well, it's the, the addendum items aren't listed in the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| It's published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| So there's no expense there, just any time or effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| But there's no payment to the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| So we're not paying for the newspaper more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Which is the intent of what we're covering with the permit fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Does anyone want to make a motion or ask a Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| So I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Is your mic on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| I thought if I turned on the light it would be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| So the parking lot needs to be addressed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Before and then the Department of Agriculture is the very final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| That's correct, Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| So that could take a full 60 days to even happen or even 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| Should we push this out to give you time to do the task class and the thing again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| So do you want 60 days, 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| I'll do 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| I mean, unless somebody feels that we've dragged this on for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| and then I will take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Mr. Patel, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| And we're going to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| I would be inclined to say that this is the last extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| But before we get, like, say, 30 days down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| and you guys think you're not going to make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| can we please talk before you end up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| If you don't get your permit before the end of the 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| you'll have to come back and see us here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| and then we have to make the decision of not extending it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| We've just never had one go on this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| And I think this is the second-plus time we've had to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| about you guys going and doing additional stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| because of the extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| So I realize some of that's not your fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Your architect died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| It's just an unusual circumstance that things have dragged out this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| The motion was for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Can I request that we phrase these extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| in the terms of the meeting you wish to extend it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| as opposed to the number of days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| The beer board does not meet every 30 or 60 or 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| So it would be the May meeting if you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Would you like to revise your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| I think we should wait until the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Do you need the specific date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| So I make that motion to wait until May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Councilwoman Parker, are you still a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Thanks for bearing with us, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Thank you, Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| I'll give you my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Our next agenda item is Hyatt Place, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| Bruce White, Elizabeth White, Kimberly Gallo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Trenton Keelan, 530 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Officer Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Nothing to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| They're good on our end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| We just need the certificate of occupancy for inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| The fire part is already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Would you like to give us an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| When I last appeared before you, we thought we would be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| get this accomplished within 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| It took a lot longer than we thought, but I can say that as of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| last week, all inspections have been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| We've been in communications with the building department, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| they're processing to release the CO to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| So I guess I would be requesting to the next meeting, because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| likely will happen this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| I can't imagine it would be any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| We've fulfilled everything else at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| So you've done all your inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Mr. Byrd is just waiting on your certificate of occupancy to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| issued by the building department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| But you have no outstanding inspections to be done by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Mr. Byrd, would we anticipate 30 days would do it for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| Based on that description, I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| The inspections folks have to process things even after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| inspector's been out, but that's typically not a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| I'm going to move to approve pending final documentation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| an extension of 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| We're picking up new lingo tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| And if you get it prior to that, then all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Just turn it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Councilwoman McKenzie, you want to turn your light off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Just so I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Or do you want to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| I'll let you talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| We hope you get your COO quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Have a good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| And our next agenda item is Lunaverse, Knoxville, Bernadette West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Bernadette West, 940 Blackstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Officer Taylor, anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Just needing that COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| So here's the latest, and it's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| We have passed all inspections in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| so we are good to go as far as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Everything has been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| However, when they came to inspect the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| and they realized the sitting building realized that it's all one-lotted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1854)|
| 0:31:02| and that it's kind of a combination between the A one and the B one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| that you were just listening to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| The parking lot, which is where the people would park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| it was not included as a life safety plan in the initial documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| that we submitted that the city was supposed to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| and so they didn't realize that that needed to be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| in what they looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| And even though they have looked at that parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| and know that it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| we have to have an architect draw up the life safety plan for the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| But because it was their fault for not seeing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| or their taking responsibility for not noticing that that needed to be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| in the drawings that we had submitted before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| they're going to expedite it this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| It's just a matter of drawing the life safety plan through the architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| to include the attachments that are already in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| for the building inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| So we have the CO for the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| but because the parking lot is where they're parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| they need that before they can give us the whole kit and caboodle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| If I could request to be pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| it should be done by the end of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| It's an extension of one to two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| Yeah, we're just giving you an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| We approved you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| One month extension pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| Well, I'm personally excited for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| because this one is being kind of on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| You're almost at three years on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| so I know it's been a grueling process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| Well, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| You've got to see the light at the end of the tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| You're all invited when we have our first shindig,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| which will probably be Thursday in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| We'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| We'll send out an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| If you like to dance, we have lots of dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| I'll approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| A motion to extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| To extend to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Anybody want to second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| Before I call for a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Ms. West, so you're having to pay an architect to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| and whatever and turn in that document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| But they have to make that drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| To put signs up to, you know, in case of emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| open here or exit here or run over here kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| But it has to be a life safety plan in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| So we have to make sure that they know where to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| if there is a fire that starts in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| On asphalt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| On asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2036)|

| 0:33:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2042)|

| 0:34:16| That's the final?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240220?start=2056)|
