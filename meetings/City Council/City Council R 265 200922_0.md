| 0:25:57| about that office and put something else in there. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=1557)|

| 0:36:49| Yes, can you hear me now? Yes, we can. So, Mr. Pagano,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| thanks for resolving the technical issues, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| you have up to five minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Excellent. Thank you very much. Again, my name is Joe Pagano,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| and I actually represent Matthews Environmental Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| We're the manufacturers of the cremator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| which is intended to be put into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| Bridges facility. I can only speak to the specifics of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| our machines and not our competitors or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| Matthews has been in the business of making cremators since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| 1946. We're a publicly traded company on NASDAQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| We have over 4,500 cremator installations around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| operating on five continents. Specific to the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| the EPA has done extensive studies, not just of mercury, but other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| particulate matter that is released from the cremators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| and as such, they don't regulate cremators. They leave it up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| states. I can speak to the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| specifically. Matthews has, just ourselves and not our competitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| have over 90 cremators, which are installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| throughout the state of Tennessee, so all of which conform to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| standards, safety and otherwise, of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| environmental boards and regulations. If there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| any concerns about these, obviously the state and federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| government would have said so. One of the reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| these cremators or crematories are put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| into the areas that they are put into is a very large concern of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| loved ones, the families of the deceased, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| revolves around the idea of chain of custody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| so that you don't have a funeral home that doesn't have the capacity to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| cremations at their facility, and then they have to contract with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| third party, put the deceased into a vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| transport them sometimes up to hours to a different facility where they can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| cremated, and then the cremains returned to the loved ones. That's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| that funeral homes are trying to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| Obviously, there are liability issues and also trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| issues that are very, very caught up in that idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| so it's one reason why these funeral homes are putting cremators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| closer to residential areas. The air that comes out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| the stack on the cremator is as clean as the air that is going into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| or the air in the surrounding area. There's a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| that breaks down the products of combustion, the carbon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| at a molecular level. It goes not only through a primary chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| but through a second cleansing chamber where the particles are broken down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| before they're released out into the atmosphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| so what will be released into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| will just be hot but clean air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| Okay, is that all you had to wanted to speak to, Mr. Bergano?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| Yes. Mr. Bergano, could we get your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| Certainly. I live at 204 Wessex Road and that's Altamonte Springs, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2431)|

| 0:40:52| going to go back to Ms. Hall and see if Ms. Lee is with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| I think it's Ms. Hill. Ms. Hill, is Ms. Lee on your call with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| on the same connection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2462)|

| 0:41:45| polluting this air. Early in the morning, you can really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| smell all kinds of odor out here in Moundsville. We're closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2509)|

| 0:42:07| consideration and build it somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| The cemetery from where we're looking is just a regular cemetery. I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| anything beautiful about it. And where they're going to build it, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| it's at that office, that's closer to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| than the rest of the cemetery. I wish you all would think twice about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| because we already have health problems from all this pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2553)|

| 0:42:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2562)|

| 0:42:52| Okay. So, council members, that's the people that concludes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| people who we normally hear from. I don't know if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| was one other person signed up. I'm not sure if she's even on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| So now it's up to you to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| And the motion on the floor is to approve. Council member Seng.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| Thank you, Mayor. I hear the people from Lonsdale's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| That was actually my concern when I first saw it on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| which is why I went down there to try to do some research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| and to make sure that this was not being put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| into a neighborhood just because it was a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| that couldn't, you know, get rid of it. Between the steel mill and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| the industrial sites that are out there, there is a lot of pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| But I really don't feel that this is going to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| I have talked with Environmental Health from the Knox County Air Quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2634)|

| 0:44:04| crematorium in Fountain City, which I also went to, to see what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2644)|

| 0:44:13| if someone did not know the crematorium was there, they wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| know that the crematorium was there. They're not putting out pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| If they were, I would have really different feelings about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Seng.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Any other questions or discussion? Council Member Parker. I had a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| questions, and I have not been able to become an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2676)|

| 0:44:47| But reading into it, it seems if there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| something emitting from the crematorium, there's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| wrong with the crematorium these days, in modern crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| And there are assurances that the owners would be notified immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2702)|
| 0:45:11| if something were to go wrong. But I wanted to know a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| about that process. They've been assured that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| even their folks down in Florida will know immediately if anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| goes wrong. And if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| from, I don't know who would want to speak on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| but who could, I don't know if it's our last speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2734)|

| 0:45:54| I've enabled him to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| Mr. Pagano, were you, did you hear the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| I'm afraid it's the same problem we had earlier with Mr. Pagano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| Well, maybe, can you just keep him enabled to speak until this vote is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| concluded? Yes, ma'am. All right, is there another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| representative who understands that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| perhaps Mr. Levin, maybe, or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| I've enabled Mr. Levin to speak. Okay, I can tell you what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| I've learned and what I've listened to Mr. Pagano talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| My understanding is that the facility is monitored 24 hours a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2799)|

| 0:46:51| the current technology, they're able to monitor it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| at all times and able to, they do annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2814)|
| 0:47:02| preventative maintenance and things like that to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| there aren't problems or issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| aren't taken care of through maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| Other than that, I can't really answer to beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Mr. Pagano, able to speak yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| Okay, Ms. Parker, did you... Mrs. Bridges, speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| Was that? Mrs. Bridges, speak to it. Yeah, Ms. Bridges, could you speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| do you have any response to Ms. Parker's questions or want to speak to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| the question again? So, let's say there's an issue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| happens at the crematorium. There are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| you know, certain, maybe mercury is being released at a higher level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| than it should be. That's showing up on your monitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| I was trying to get a better sense of what that process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| because I've learned that even your folks down in Florida would get notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| if there's anything, if there's any issues. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| trying to understand, is that a 30-minute fix? Is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| is there potential that there could be an issue that occurs and, you know, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| weeks that go by before the company could address it? I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| just trying to understand a little bit more about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| Sure, that's a good question. It's my understanding, well actually, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| understand, we would be notified immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| and also just to let you know that if we, if there is a cremation taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| we do have a certified crematory operator who is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| So, we don't just, they're not just cremating with no one, with no one around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| So, if there was an issue, whether it be an admission issue, we would be notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| immediately and we would take the steps set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| that, safety steps obviously, to shut it down at that moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| and get the repairs done immediately. It is very, they're very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| Yes. This is Joe Pagano. I'm sorry, I was able to get back onto the call now. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| if you need me to address that issue. Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Bridges. Mr. Pagano, if you could address the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| as well. So, and I apologize if I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| if this is redundant over what's already been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| but there is a computer which is based on the cremation unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| which allows us to monitor 365 days, 24 by 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| We are able to remediate in real time remotely from our corporate offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| in Apopka, Florida. We can make adjustments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| air valves, gas valves, every operational piece of that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| If necessary, we can do a forced automatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| shutdown in a worst case scenario, which would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| you know, whatever you could think of remotely from Apopka, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| Does that address the question? It does. Thank you. That's really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| And another question I had was, you know, I've been able to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| with some community members, and they said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| with this project, if it is to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| you know, they're interested to know how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| you all are willing to work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| and reach out to the community to fill potential jobs that are going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| open, and perhaps even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3051)|
| 0:50:59| well, let me just ask that question. Would you be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| open to working with the community moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| if this is approved on identifying individuals who could could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| fill, you know, upcoming job openings at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| I guess that's for Ms. Bridges. Ms. Bridges? I'm happy to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| question, and absolutely we would. We are like every other employer, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| think, in the area and across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| We're always looking for good people, so absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| we would. We're very proud to be a part of the community, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| we would love that. I would welcome that. That would be great, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| And then a final question. There was just one other question from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| community, and based on a conversation, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| that that took place at the meeting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| the community, but there was a discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| that this would be a benefit to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| because of the funeral home located there, it would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| lower cost for a cremation than if the crematorium were located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| elsewhere. Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| I don't know if that came up at the meeting. I know that, well, basically, let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| me just say this. First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| number one, it's too premature to say to give actual numbers to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| You know, we're still a ways away. Would it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| less expensive to go through that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| than other locations? I see that happening, yes, but I can't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| for certain, but it does make sense because if that is there just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| cremations, then you don't have the overhead that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| you would have at a full-service funeral home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| somewhere else that has chapels and parking and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| decorations and all of that, so the overhead would be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| Reasonably, I think that's a reasonable question, but again, it's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| pretty premature for me to give a definite answer, but I would say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| you're on the right track, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| Okay, that's helpful. Okay, those are all my questions. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3200)|

| 0:54:00| I should have stated this earlier. I thought there might be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| discussion. I didn't realize we were going straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3244)|

| 0:54:28| But from, you know, I wanted to clarify those issues. Thank you for answering my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3268)|

| 0:56:21| Vice Mayor McKenzie's question. Is that Mr. Loven? Are you still on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| Yes, yes. Well, we looked through the regulations that were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| and this is a cemetery. And honestly, I didn't really think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| it being an adverse impact to to anyone. And because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| we are in compliance with all of the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3408)|

| 0:57:11| so those regulations were set forth and I really just didn't see that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| was going to be an issue. Right. And thank you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3437)|

| 0:57:59| I would definitely want to be made aware of before it comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3479)|

| 0:58:20| members who actually brought it to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| that they were not aware. And just encourage you guys going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| especially when it comes to crematoriums, that there are some communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3508)|

| 0:58:36| And again, I also agree with Council Member Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| as relates to just continued research, as it relates to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3519)|

| 0:59:07| hard decision for me to make because I'm certainly an environmentalist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| and concerned with health issues. There is a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| pollution in Lonsdale because of existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3557)|

| 0:59:25| think from everything I've heard that the crematorium with the technology that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| they have today is going to add to that. Part of what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| go by is I remember when this whole discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| came about in Fountain City a few years ago. I wasn't on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| council at that time, but I lived close to Fountain City. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| aware of the way that process played out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| These very same concerns, very legitimate concerns, were raised at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3588)|

| 1:00:10| possible pollution, I based my vote a bit on a track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| of a crematorium that we already have in a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3616)|

| 1:00:33| I do think, based on the best knowledge I have, that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=3633)|

| 1:45:49| Council Member Parker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| I was just surprised to see this come about because we're in a pandemic year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6352)|
| 1:46:03| we have a pretty austere budget, and this seems like a pretty big increase. And from what I read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6363)|
| 1:46:11| it is for multiple things, but part of it is to develop a trail that wasn't budgeted for. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6371)|
| 1:46:21| that's one thing I could not distinguish from the documents. You don't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6381)|
| 1:46:32| the bulk of the expense was for the trail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| Mr. Cannon, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| Mayor, this is David Bryce, too. Let me, if I could jump in on the front end and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| Cannon could talk about the details. Thank you for the question, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| So I think, first, it's important to note that the original dollars budgeted for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| the $10 million, this is out of that original total capital amount. And so this project was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| divided into two phases, the first phase being infrastructure, roads, pipes, that type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6422)|
| 1:47:09| A later phase will be amenities, facilities within those spaces, play areas, et cetera. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6429)|
| 1:47:18| the infrastructure and then what I call the fun stuff, the park stuff. So this is all from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| $10 million budget that was budgeted, excuse me, previously for this entire area at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6443)|
| 1:47:31| permit at the James White Parkway. So again, it's existing dollars. We knew based on the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| there would be some modifications and some additions later. So it is a large amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| but it is all budgeted. And it's just moving some of that into this phase. So I'll let Mr. Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6462)|
| 1:47:50| jump on and answer some other, dovetail into that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| I think Deputy Mayor Brace said it well. By the way, Harold Cannon, Director, Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6475)|

| 1:48:08| This was budgeted, but not originally part of phase one. And the best analogy that I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| offer council is that the cake in this case was 90 to 95% baked, but it was time to serve the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6493)|
| 1:48:25| and make a presence in the urban wilderness. We had worked through the negotiations with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| It was important to the administration and council at that time to make a presence and to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| activity. And that's what happened. As this project progressed, there were some changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| enhance the urban wilderness to modify it slightly. You'll see that in some of the storm water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6523)|
| 1:48:50| modifications. Also, this trail that you're speaking of, it was intended to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| as part of the project, but not necessarily phase one. However, seeing the scope of the trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6537)|
| 1:49:04| if you will, it seemed very appropriate to have a grading contractor complete this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6544)|
| 1:49:10| We believe it would be in the city's and this budget's best interest to include this in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6550)|

| 1:49:22| So the trail you anticipated you would need a contractor for, just you didn't expect it in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| phase. The trail was shown on the plans as trail by others. And there's no question that a contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6569)|
| 1:49:37| was going to be needed. Candidly, the design was not complete on it yet. But it was more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| to get the project moving and making a presence related to the urban wilderness. Mr. Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6583)|
| 1:49:50| let me clarify. The trail was always going to be built. The design work had not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| As we started to develop the design work, it was decided that the level of construction warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6596)|
| 1:50:05| putting it into phase one versus an amenity in phase two. So yes, it was always anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6605)|
| 1:50:11| just the design work had not yet been fully completed. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=6611)|

| 1:59:20| We actually had this scheduled to be done last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| Only because of the compactor and the pits and the way they are designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| they are considered a confined space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| So the contractor that we had then wasn't perfectly comfortable, so we have rebid it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7171)|
| 1:59:36| And this is for Ziggurat to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| So what it is is where you push the waste into the compactors over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| The waste at the bottom of these compactors basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| just like anything else, starts to deteriorate and wear out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| So there are some holes in the bottom of the pit area where waste can gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| And of course, where waste gathers, you have more availability for rodents to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| And obviously, it's hard to get all the waste out when you have these holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| So in addition to the holes in the bottom of the pits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| there's also an old push paddle that has not been used in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| It used to be, that's basically a big arm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| that used to come and push the garbage into the pit areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| Really, it's not the most efficient because garbage inevitably goes outside of the reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| of the push paddle and you have to use a front end loader to push the garbage in anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| So we have been using that method for the last 15 years, longer than I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| in order to push the waste into that pit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| So it's a little confusing unless you've seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| but that's probably the best explanation I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7238)|

| 2:00:50| I just wanted to comment to Mr. Weth, and I'm assuming your staff is probably not listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| to our meeting, but if they were, to commend the staff that work there at the transfer station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| It was a great group of guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| I think you have some pretty long-running employees that have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| Some of the folks that work there at the booth as well, really great employees there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7266)|
| 2:01:13| I'm not very good at backing up my little trailer when I take it over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| and so your guys have actually helped me with my inability to back up expertly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| So I appreciate them, and they're nice regardless of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| And they have no idea I'm a council member, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| They just think I'm a dumb person that can't back a trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| Yeah, Charlie Thomas is the manager, and Tammy Tarver, who has been in that scale house for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| about 20 years now, is really the face of that, and they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| It's very professional staff over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7304)|

| 2:09:42| And great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| So, we are projecting rental rates in the year that this project opens, which will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7783)|
| 2:09:50| August of 2023, to be around $1,000 per bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7790)|
| 2:09:57| And so, you know, that's based on existing assets or existing competition in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7797)|
| 2:10:07| And, you know, as you all know, as we introduce more units into the market, that tends to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| take pressure off rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| So, you know, by allowing this project to move forward, we, you know, we're expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| rents could be lowered off of that projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7820)|
| 2:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| That was the only question I had about the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| And I had a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| I did not see as a part of this pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7836)|
| 2:10:44| similar benefits that we saw in the previous pilot that just came before City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7844)|
| 2:10:53| in terms of securing more benefits for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| Was that pursued in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| Ms. Welch, could you address that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7863)|
| 2:11:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| And that's a great question, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| So, the pilot that you, the pilot resolution that you approved previously with Fraley-Schindler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7866)|
| 2:11:14| was a jobs pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| That really was a pilot that was intended to grow jobs in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7875)|
| 2:11:22| And that was the focus of that particular pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| This is really more focused on a redevelopment project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| And so, when you're looking at redevelopment projects, we're really looking at how to promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7890)|
| 2:11:36| and encourage the kind of development we want to see in our city, which was really set forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| by a vision plan for the Cumberland Avenue redevelopment corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7901)|
| 2:11:46| And there's a form-based code that requires certain design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| It requires structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| The developer had to meet both of those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| In addition to that, it's providing additional housing that is particularly in a sector that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7917)|
| 2:12:04| tends to put pressure on the affordability and availability of housing across our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7924)|
| 2:12:11| for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| So, those are the kinds of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| Among others, when we're looking at redevelopment pilots, we might look at things like, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7934)|
| 2:12:21| this is a site that's currently a single-story suburban-style development that's really in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7941)|
| 2:12:27| the urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| And so, we would like to see more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| And, you know, promoting that through this type of project is a benefit to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7951)|
| 2:12:41| And is this a project where they have shown that it would not be able to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7961)|

| 2:12:51| Also, a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| So, that's really the intent of the third-party review is to, and I can, again, I'll defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7972)|
| 2:13:01| a little bit to Mr. Evans on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| But our third-party review, we're probably one of the only cities in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7983)|
| 2:13:10| that does a third-party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| And the entire intent of that is to, first of all, verify the numbers that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| is submitting are correct and accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| And then, secondly, to determine financial viability of the project with and without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8001)|
| 2:13:31| tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| So, we feel really that our third-party review process is taking care of that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8012)|
| 2:13:39| That's a really good question that you just asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| And thank you for that clarification, because it helps me to understand what has been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8022)|
| 2:13:49| as the benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| For me, I'm struggling to see how this helps with our affordability issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8032)|
| 2:14:00| I am currently helping a friend who does not drive, only takes public transportation, makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| $70,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| Does not want to spend more than $1,000 on housing and needs to be near downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8049)|
| 2:14:16| And it's close to impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| But what is available are a lot of student housing rooms that are, you know, at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8060)|
| 2:14:29| $1,000 a bed, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| You're not able to get your own individual bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| So, these really are housing options just for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| And right now, we have multiple student housing complexes that can't fill their apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8081)|
| 2:14:50| and are giving really big discounts to try to fill those apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8090)|
| 2:14:57| We're not able to continue our trolley line over into South Knoxville because of the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8097)|
| 2:15:04| and lack of use there when we were hoping that the apartment community developing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8104)|
| 2:15:10| would help keep that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| So, I'm just concerned that continued investment in these types of housing complexes will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8112)|
| 2:15:21| a detriment to our community, especially to our affordable housing stock around the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| area where these folks, you know, want to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| So, it's closer to UT, but there are folks in our community who can't find, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8131)|
| 2:15:39| a one-bedroom apartment for $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8139)|
| 2:15:45| And that seems like more of the issue than getting more student housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8145)|
| 2:15:52| Am I not reading it correctly, or is our student housing lower stock than I'm realizing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| Well, Council Member Parker, I would just say, oh, well, I would just say, and then Mr. Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8158)|
| 2:16:05| and Ms. Welch can add on, it's just that, you know, I share your concerns about affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| And one thing that you learn in, you know, Econ 101 is just that as you increase supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8171)|
| 2:16:19| of housing, price goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| So, these particular apartments don't fit the criteria that your friend and many other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| people need, but they do increase the supply of housing overall, which can lower the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8188)|
| 2:16:33| for housing and lower the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| You know, students right now who may eventually be in this complex, which is going to be 700| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8194)|
| 2:16:41| beds or something, a lot of people could live here who might right now be taking up or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8201)|
| 2:16:49| you know, filling up the supply of apartments in Fort Sanders or nearby neighborhoods in adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8209)|
| 2:16:57| to Fort Sanders and UT and South, West, East and North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8217)|
| 2:17:02| So, supply and demand is part of the equation that we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| So, Ms. Welch or Mr. Evans, do you have something else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| You know, this is Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| I think you're just spot on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| But, you know, we are seeing that a lot of students are living in the shadow market right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8235)|
| 2:17:21| now, which means, you know, there may be a single family house for rent nearby, so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| renting there instead because there's just limited student housing specific supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| So, once we introduce this to the market, you know, that frees up that single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| house or other apartment and takes a lot of the strain off of the infrastructure so that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8254)|
| 2:17:41| you know, that nurse that, you know, is just trying to find a place to live close to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| hospital can move in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| I'll just maybe add on to that as Council Member Smith might have some addition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| But having represented the first district, which seems to be the area of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| where there's, you know, a lot of student housing, you know, I observed that shadow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| housing market where there, you know, and this is, you know, not intended to be critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8287)|
| 2:18:13| but there certainly is the conversion of single family homes into multiplexes that are geared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8293)|
| 2:18:21| towards students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| Those homes could be used for family housing or non-student housing if there were more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8302)|
| 2:18:30| student-specific housing on the market as our population of student housing or students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8310)|
| 2:18:36| on campus continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| And the campus is very geographically bound right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8318)|
| 2:18:43| You know, they don't have a lot of room for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| So, we need to have a place to house those students so that it doesn't put pressure on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8326)|
| 2:18:52| our single family housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| Well, just to add to that, I grew up in that District 1 on Shared Road and saw that first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8336)|
| 2:19:03| student housing complex be built in my, you know, essentially in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8343)|
| 2:19:10| And was a, you know, was in high school at the time and got excited about the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| of living there one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| And then this was 20-something years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| And then learned that it was, I think it was $600 a bed at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| And that apartment complex became not an option for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| And I became one of those students who moved into a house with a high school friend and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8371)|
| 2:19:38| paid, you know, $250 in rent per month rather than $600 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8378)|
| 2:19:43| And our economy hasn't changed that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| People aren't making, you know, at the time I was working at the downtown library, making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| about $850 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| There are lots of folks making $850 an hour still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| So, I don't know who, I'm sure y'all are studying the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| And you wouldn't build it if you couldn't rent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| But what I'm saying is that may be feeling a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| But your argument is just not falling on me because I know I'm representing so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8409)|
| 2:20:17| And I would say it's got to be the majority of folks who are enrolling at UT and can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8417)|
| 2:20:24| afford the rent of these housing complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| So, they're going to continue to look for cheaper housing outside of these spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8428)|
| 2:20:36| I just, I have to drill that point in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| Also, I do a little research into other college towns where these developers are going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8439)|
| 2:20:46| with these housing complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| If you look into Tuscaloosa, other college towns, over the long term, we're seeing negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8448)|
| 2:20:55| impacts on the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| We're seeing a lack of affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| So, that's what I'm worried about long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| I'm worried about us not being focused on the affordable housing crisis and instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8462)|
| 2:21:11| investing in these options in an effort to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8471)|
| 2:21:16| But over time, we've seen it hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8476)|
| 2:21:21| The student housing that came 20 years ago is more expensive now than it was 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8486)|
| 2:21:26| It hasn't helped us create more affordable rental market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8486)|
| 2:21:33| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| Yeah, I have a couple questions for Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| Typically, these pilots, the pilots the council has seen in the past couple of years have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| been 15, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8507)|
| 2:21:48| This is six and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| So, can you talk about why this is so short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8510)|
| 2:21:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8514)|
| 2:21:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8515)|
| 2:21:55| I think that this pilot is shorter because the third party review really determined that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8515)|
| 2:22:03| this was the length of pilot that would result in financial viability of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8523)|
| 2:22:11| So, I think in some ways, that's an indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| If you look at the more recent pilots that council has approved that have been 15, 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8533)|
| 2:22:21| year pilots, I think this is an indicator that the market is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8541)|
| 2:22:26| And that's a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| And what that means for the city is that the increased income from property taxes will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8549)|
| 2:22:40| come to the city and to the county sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| Just one follow-up item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| I think just for the public, I think it's really important that typically, I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| only, the public may only see pilots that are coming before council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| But there are pilots that don't ever make it to this point of the process because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| third party rejects them or the administration, maybe yourself, reviews those and don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8578)|
| 2:23:04| they're a good idea for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| So, I imagine you've already said no to a few in your short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| But I think that's really important for everybody to know that not every developer that wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| a pilot either even gets a green light from the administration, nor do they get a green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8596)|
| 2:23:22| light all the time from the third party review or MUNICAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| So, I think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| The other thing that I think I just want to reiterate is UT just signed up their largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8607)|
| 2:23:33| enrolling freshman class ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| And they are bound by geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| And this uses existing land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| And understanding our recent approval of a tree canopy study, I think where we can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8620)|
| 2:23:47| housing and existing footprint without building into legacy neighborhoods or into scrawling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8627)|
| 2:23:54| away from the campus, I think is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| So, I think this is a really good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| I think this is a really narrow pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| There's no cash outlay for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| So, I'll definitely be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| You're still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| Ms. Walsh, we talked about a lot of things today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| And my concern was, is that a location that needs to be incentivized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| I would think that a developer would want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| Thanks, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| It was good to speak with you earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| Would you like me to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8685)|
| 2:24:45| So, you know, one of the things about this particular location is that it is in the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8685)|
| 2:24:51| based district on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| So, there are some requirements that developers would not have to adhere to if it were developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8693)|
| 2:25:01| say, on a green field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| And I think Councilman Smith's comment earlier about saving our tree canopy and using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8702)|
| 2:25:09| land that already has infrastructure and is in a location that's walkable, that is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8709)|
| 2:25:17| close proximity to UT, but also has parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8717)|
| 2:25:22| Structured parking is quite expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| It also has some pretty interesting, and I'll let Mr. Evans talk about this, there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| alleyway that runs through the middle of the parcel that they're going to have to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8732)|
| 2:25:36| over and keep that alleyway accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| So, there's some conditions of the property itself and of the form based district that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8739)|
| 2:25:50| are a little bit different and that we wouldn't necessarily consider tax abatement if it were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8750)|
| 2:25:57| on a green field or, you know, in another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| So, I think that's, you know, important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| It's exactly the kind of development that we envisioned and that we hoped that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| see along Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| I have a couple of questions for Mr. Evans as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8773)|
| 2:26:17| Can you hear me, Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8780)|
| 2:26:23| I was looking online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| There are a lot of great start companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| You are from Nashville, and that's where the majority of the work has been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8793)|
| 2:26:33| So, we are headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| We have development offices in most major cities throughout the U.S. and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8797)|
| 2:26:43| have expanded internationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| And I run the Tennessee office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| So, you know, I'm here in Nashville and focused on Tennessee markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8809)|
| 2:26:56| We've been trying to get into Knoxville for a while, you know, really, obviously, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8816)|
| 2:27:02| a lot of things about your great city and, you know, just have not been able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8822)|
| 2:27:09| up with a feasible project until now and, you know, have been diligently working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8829)|
| 2:27:14| this one for the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| What is the rate of return you're expecting with the pilot and without the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8837)|
| 2:27:24| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8844)|
| 2:27:24| So, the rate of return that MuniCAP has kind of come up with as, you know, what they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8844)|
| 2:27:35| a developer should receive for taking this amount of risk is a 12 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8855)|
| 2:27:42| They say in their report 12 to 20 percent internal rate of return on a project of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8862)|
| 2:27:49| type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| And so, without the pilot, we are at a 10.9, according to, you know, those third-party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8870)|
| 2:27:58| numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| And then with the part, with the pilot, that gets us to over a 12, at a 12 and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8879)|
| 2:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| I think for the city, it means about $5 million over this six and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8887)|
| 2:28:15| I'm just mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| So, most of the construction that's been done, you said it was international.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| Do you, does Graystar usually seek public assistance to build, to develop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| So, typically, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| And most of our work has been done domestically here in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8909)|
| 2:28:35| But no, we, you know, typically, we will run across a situation where the deal pencils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8915)|
| 2:28:44| so to speak, without public assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| We, there are certain instances, and I would, you know, if I had to guess, I'd say maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8928)|
| 2:28:55| you know, 25 percent or so of the projects we pursue just need some sort of help from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| the city to make them work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| I will say that the third-party review process that we went through for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8943)|
| 2:29:08| has been by far the most difficult that we've encountered today, just in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| pushing back on assumptions and really, really vetting our numbers to make sure that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8954)|
| 2:29:21| know, everybody was on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| That's why it's such a wonderful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| No, Ms. Welch, you did a very good job with, you know, helping accommodate them and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| also not having it be more than what is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| My last question to Mr. Evans is, so this is, it's not very affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8976)|
| 2:29:44| It is what the market can bear for certain people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| Is there any, is there any affordable housing developments in the present, not anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| Are there some, an amount of apartments you can give and make them more affordable in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=8995)|
| 2:30:02| this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| So, we did talk about that at the very inception of this project with Stephanie and Don Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9006)|
| 2:30:12| Foster at the beginning of, gosh, that was pre-pandemic, so it seems like forever ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9012)|

| 2:30:37| So, you know, where we landed on this one at a six and a half year request contemplates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9037)|

| 2:30:47| So, you know, we are investing in redeveloping a property that now is really in disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9047)|
| 2:30:53| There's a lot of vacancy on the existing site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9053)|
| 2:30:57| We think we're relieving, you know, we're very confident that we're going to relieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9057)|

| 2:31:13| So, I know parking has always been, or has recently been a big hot button item for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9073)|

| 2:31:30| So, we are self-sufficient with parking, did not request any variances there, and we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9090)|

| 2:33:00| What percentage of your developments would you say are market rate versus affordable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9180)|
| 2:33:07| We – so, we kind of – being a – you know, an affordable housing developer is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| very kind of niche segment of our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9192)|
| 2:33:17| And so, we really focus on market rate opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9197)|
| 2:33:23| You know, I think kind of answering, you know, RFPs and kind of going through the affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9203)|
| 2:33:34| housing process is just a kind of a different animal, so to speak, than the market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| So, we, you know, rarely will do an affordable housing – you know, entirely affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9220)|

| 2:33:58| is kind of a way of creating affordability, if you want to look at that point from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9238)|
| 2:34:02| stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9242)|
| 2:34:02| But as far as, like, having a cap on rents for some additional city incentive, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9242)|
| 2:34:11| not something that we specialize in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9255)|
| 2:34:15| I mean, it sounds like, you know, you guys are probably a leader in your industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| I mean, if you've done $15 billion in investments, and then we talk about the 12.5 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9260)|
| 2:34:27| net return versus the 10.9 percent with a portfolio that your company has, it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9267)|
| 2:34:34| has me questioning, you know, the but for with this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9274)|
| 2:34:43| However, I agree that it is a narrow pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| Councilwoman Parker made some very valid points and concerns that I had not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9287)|
| 2:34:53| considered prior to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| And so, I'm really struggling with this pilot, to be quite honest with you, at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9296)|

| 2:35:06| I'm going to leave it there for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9306)|
| 2:35:10| Vice Mayor McKenzie and other members of Council, I just want to say that I readily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9310)|
| 2:35:17| acknowledge that affordable housing is of paramount concern to members of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| and to members of the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| This is one measure and one way to address that by increasing the supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9326)|
| 2:35:33| Just last week, we broke ground on a new affordable housing project for low to moderate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9333)|
| 2:35:39| income people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9339)|

| 2:35:46| We are working with Volunteer Ministry Center to add to permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9346)|
| 2:35:51| another complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9351)|

| 2:36:00| We have numerous programs in our Housing and Neighborhood Development Department to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| people become homeowners, to help private entities like HomeSource and others bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9364)|
| 2:36:12| those gaps, build more affordable housing, build more programs for people to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9372)|
| 2:36:19| their income so they can afford more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| I realize this is not affordable, but it is part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9382)|
| 2:36:27| And it's really gone under great scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| As Mr. Evans said, this is a big corporation that goes through this kind of process all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9391)|
| 2:36:35| the time, and they haven't faced this kind of scrutiny in any other city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| And that's because we need to be really careful and judicious with the tax abatements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9399)|
| 2:36:44| we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| And as you all know, this is six and a half years where we're just waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9406)|
| 2:36:50| And then after that six and a half years expires, we have a $91 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| And we're going to be able to enjoy the sustainability benefits of having a high-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9416)|
| 2:37:02| multimodal development right next to the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9422)|
| 2:37:06| We're going to enjoy additional tax revenues based on the significantly increased property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9426)|
| 2:37:13| values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| I think it's also, you know, just a big part of the solution is to add in adding more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9435)|
| 2:37:20| housing supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| I mean, we want to help where we can to address places where the market economy doesn't help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9441)|
| 2:37:30| people in need and help them bridge those gaps with low- to moderate-income housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9450)|
| 2:37:35| that the city funds can help bridge those financing gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| This is another way to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| So it takes many different strategies, and I think this is an important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| I think that the third-party objective review gives me great confidence that this is a worthwhile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9466)|
| 2:37:55| investment for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9475)|
| 2:37:56| We're not losing any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| We're just giving them six and a half years before we appreciate, you know, get the increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9477)|

| 2:38:07| So I hope you'll vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| I think it's a good thing for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| I think it's one small part of our affordable housing strategy, just like some of our other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9492)|
| 2:38:17| more subsidized are, and some of our investments in Austin Homes and, you know, various housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9497)|

| 2:38:27| So that's what I just wanted to mention that and encourage your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9512)|

| 2:38:36| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9517)|
| 2:38:38| I mean, I don't disagree with the efforts that we're making as a city toward affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9518)|
| 2:38:43| and the investments that we've made and we're continuing to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| I'm really struggling to, you know, and I think Mr. Evans mentioned when asked, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| Councilwoman Singh, that they don't typically ask for public assistance with pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9531)|
| 2:38:58| And so I think that's where the conversation went when he talked about the third-party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9538)|
| 2:39:04| Again, I don't, I think that this project would happen without a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9544)|
| 2:39:10| And that's just my opinion as it relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9550)|
| 2:39:14| And I think I'm finished with my conversation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| I think Mr. Evans said something about they don't, when they don't have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9558)|
| 2:39:24| to get the return and the city's not interested in this kind of a pilot program, they just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9564)|
| 2:39:32| walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9572)|
| 2:39:32| They don't invest there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9572)|
| 2:39:33| Did I misunderstand what you said, Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| We, you know, this is a difficult project for all the reasons that Stephanie mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9578)|
| 2:39:46| with respect to form-based zoning that's in place and, you know, us trying to meet that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9586)|
| 2:39:53| We've got 30 feet of topographic change across a really small site that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| We've got an existing alleyway that we're, you know, we've worked very hard with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9598)|
| 2:40:04| planning staff to keep in place and, you know, the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| And so there are just a number of incredibly difficult hurdles for a project like this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9608)|
| 2:40:14| happen in this particular occasion where, you know, if we don't get the pilot, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9614)|
| 2:40:21| we would have to walk away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| And, you know, speaking about the other projects that we pursue where we don't request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9623)|
| 2:40:29| assistance, you know, those are much more straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| You know, we wouldn't have even, you know, gotten this far with those other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9632)|
| 2:40:39| So, you know, they may be out in Greenfields, a much easier development site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9639)|
| 2:40:45| You know, the site work costs would be probably much less and the deal would just pencil on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9645)|
| 2:40:50| its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9650)|
| 2:40:51| So this is kind of an entirely different annual that we've been dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| And, you know, when you say it would pencil on its own, you mentioned that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9654)|
| 2:41:00| That's not something that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| I don't understand what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| I mean, I think I do now, but it's the same language what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9664)|
| 2:41:09| So for other deals, I guess I'm saying pencil on their own, they would meet the return hurdles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9669)|
| 2:41:16| that our investors would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| And so for this one, it just clearly without a pilot and, you know, as backed up by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9678)|
| 2:41:24| third party report, doesn't meet those return hurdles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| So in other words, our investors require a certain return because they're taking a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| risk, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| And so if they looked at this deal without any help on taxes, they would just say, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9695)|
| 2:41:45| we're not interested in investing in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| We'll go on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| So I hope that clarifies it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9711)|
| 2:41:52| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| Yeah, I have a few questions, things that I asked Ms. Welch, but for the representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9715)|
| 2:42:00| from Graystar, I think I want to make a couple of question comments to kind of get to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9720)|
| 2:42:05| you were just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| Okay, first off, when you talk about a pilot and return for investors, I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9727)|
| 2:42:19| to clarify, we keep referring to this as assistance, the city isn't outlaying, it's we are just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9739)|
| 2:42:28| not taking in more taxes than we would have, and that is why it is payments in lieu of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9748)|
| 2:42:34| taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| So the money that you're not paying to the increased tax rate is going to pay your mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9756)|
| 2:42:43| balance for the project, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| It could be used for, yes, for debt service coverage, which, yes, to pay the mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9767)|
| 2:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| It could be used for that or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| It increases our bottom line, it gets our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9780)|
| 2:43:06| From that 10.9 to 12.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| Are you guys doing this as a cash project, it's not mortgaged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9790)|
| 2:43:14| No, it will have a construction loan on the project, which is one of the reasons with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9794)|
| 2:43:25| MediCap, we vetted that so thoroughly, there are a lot of loan assumptions that are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9805)|
| 2:43:32| in the project, and we do this every day, and we have really good data on what lenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9812)|
| 2:43:37| are willing to lend on, and so we've supplied all that to them, and they've come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9817)|
| 2:43:44| this conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| Okay, so when you say it pencils on its own, if I were doing project X, and I were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9826)|
| 2:43:52| to say, this is the amount of money it's going to take me to do the project, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9832)|
| 2:43:57| is the amount of money I can expect to bring in, this is the amount of money that the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| are going to cost, you present that to the lenders, and they say, there's not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| margin here to approve a loan or to approve a debt service on that as it pencils, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9848)|
| 2:44:18| with the pilot, it makes the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9858)|
