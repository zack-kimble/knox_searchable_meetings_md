| 0:00:31| Okay. Good evening. I'll call this meeting to order of Knoxville City Council on Tuesday, November 21st, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=31)|
| 0:00:38| Thank you all for being here and anybody who might be watching us on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=38)|
| 0:00:43| We want to start with an invocation, which will be given by Councilman Campin, and the Pledge of Allegiance will be led by Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=43)|
| 0:00:51| We gather this evening thankful for another day, another opportunity to serve our city and fellow citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=51)|
| 0:00:57| Let's be ever mindful of those less fortunate, those without adequate food and shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| that we will continue to search for solutions to put an end to homelessness, hunger, and support mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=62)|
| 0:01:09| We ask for safety of those who protect and service our firemen and policemen and women, that they may be shielded from harm. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=69)|
| 0:01:18| Please face the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=84)|
| 0:01:35| Please call the roll, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Councilman Brown. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| Councilman Campin. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Councilman De La Volpe. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Vice Mayor Greve. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| Councilwoman Palmer. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Councilman Pavlis. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Councilman Saunders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Councilman Starr. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| Okay, so Council, before we move on, as we did last time, I'm looking at the sign-up sheets for the different items coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=114)|
| 0:02:06| And so on the H-1 expansion 9G, there are actually one, two, three, four, five, six people who have signed up to speak against the H-1 expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=126)|
| 0:02:17| And so by Council rules, and there are two that have signed up to speak for it, so by Council rules you can have up to three people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| So what I'd like to do is call your name, and if you wouldn't mind just maybe stepping right out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| We won't get to this. We won't start on this without you coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| And if you could choose among yourselves the three people who will represent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| That's the way we typically do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| So I have here Jessica Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| And if y'all can't agree, we'll just go down the first three people I'll call on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| But Jessica Dean, Brittany Allen, Lisa Potter, John Potter, Alden Larrick, and Nikki Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| I have you down as being against H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| So if you would just step out and see if you can agree on three people to represent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| Are you all here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| Jess, are you all here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| Oh, you already have? Oh, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| I guess I should have said that before I went through this long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| Do you want to tell me who that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=197)|
| 0:03:26| Nikki Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Okay, thank you. That made it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Okay, I think that's all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| Okay, so now, is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Any discussion? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| Items for postponement. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| I want to move to postpone for six months 9F and 9G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| So we have a postponement on 9F, which is the historic design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=242)|
| 0:04:14| and 9G, which is the rezoning for the H-1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| So the people have actually signed up for 9G, but it relates to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| Do you want to just hear them all now before we vote on each of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Is that any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Councilman Dallalope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| I'm wondering if a councilman would consider leaving 9F on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| I don't think there's any real controversy over the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| and I think we had almost unanimous agreement last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Well, the thing is, the guidelines, I think, are only desired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| if, in fact, the overlay happens at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Well, I was just thinking we could dispose of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| and leave the actual overlay to be resolved with further meetings or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| But that was my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| If you don't even want to confine it to 9G, that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| Let's just leave it as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| So the motion is to postpone 9F and then 9G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Those will be two separate votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| But we'll go ahead and hear from each side if there's not objection from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| So first, in this case, it would be you're speaking to the postponement of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| So we would go first for those who are against the H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| Actually, how would we do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| We'll just go ahead and do the for and against for the H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| So what we'll do is go ahead and first have the speakers for the H-1 speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| and then those who are against the H-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| and then we will vote on the postponement as a result of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| So first we have Jenny Mezek and then Kim Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| Ms. Mezek, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| I'm going to set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| As you know, set your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Jenny Mezek, 2080 East 5th Avenue, and that's in the expansion area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| So several neighbors in favor of the H-1 expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| decide that it would be most respectful of council's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| for us to read a short statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| rather than come up individually to repeat our message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| So here is the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| We believe in cultural value of architecture and history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| in the same way we believe in the cultural value of art and music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| At the same time, we have concern for those with less income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| and see the crisis of a housing affordability in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| We believe that these aren't an either-or scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| We can have policies that encourage affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| as well as policies that recognize the benefits of culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| and the importance of pride of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| The Central City Sector Plan adopted by Knoxville City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| in September 2014 states that the top two goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| under its historic resources plan are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| one, preserve all buildings and districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| that are on the National Register of Historic Places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| two, support more National Register of Historic Place Nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| and historic overlay H-1 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| In the Park Ridge Neighborhood Small Area Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| it is listed as a recommendation to pursue expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| of the historic overlay zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| and recommends that the Park Ridge Community Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| should work with the city's Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| to pursue renovation, blight removal, and other programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| We have heard the mayor's call for additional time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| to ensure that all voices are heard during this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| We welcome the mayor's offer of city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| to assist in moving forward together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| We would ask you to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| with the goal of returning the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| to some degree of harmony and a renewed sense of shared goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| that this might be best accomplished not by tabling the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| which would do little but extend the rancor and division indefinitely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| but by agreeing to postpone the second vote to a set date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| on the agenda of the new council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| We believe that the neighborhood will benefit by a definitive timetable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| allowing goals to be met for further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| without the uncertainty that accompanies open-ended tabling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| We respectfully ask that the council postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| rather than table the vote on Park Ridge's historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Now, Kim Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| Thank you for being here, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| My name is Kim Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| I live at 516 Carter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| I've spoken with the mayor about her request that we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Knox Heritage still believes that this is a valuable tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| for that neighborhood to help maintain the diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| that we all want to see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| I think we all want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| I have worked in Center City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| and lived in Center City, Knoxville, for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| I have done neighborhood organizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| I have helped get the original overlay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| My heart is in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| So, of course, it's been painful to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| I've also seen 25 years of public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| and I've seen good behavior rewarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| I've seen bad behavior punished in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| And I believe in good public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| with good public debate and civil exchanges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| between the people involved in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| I understand that we all want to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| I want to know what that process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| You can punt this into the next council's bowl of soup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| but how are you going to solve this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| that we're all concerned with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| We've been concerned about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| and talking about it for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| We've been working on it at Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| and planning an equitable development forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| after the first year to talk about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| because it's not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| People are angry. People are distrustful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| And I just came from Chicago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| for the National Preservation Conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| and this is happening all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Preservation is a tool to preserve neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| to preserve diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| to keep low-income folks from being displaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| when improvements happen in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| So the thing I go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| was what we worked on in the Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| where we had the Fort Sanders Forum back in 1998 and 1999,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| a very contentious place at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| between all the competing interests in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| We had an impartial third party come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| to mediate those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| It was the Community Mediation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| They're a great resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| We also brought in experts in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Consensus was brought to bear in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| You know, getting some of the implementation parts put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| has been a bit challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| But that's what I would like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| I mean, this is a tool we endorse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| We think it's a good thing for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| I think a lot of energy has been spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| in negative ways that are wasteful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| and not helpful in this process at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| So I would like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| what the administration's plan is for solving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| because just postponing it is not going to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Okay, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Those are the two who are speaking for the H-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| and now against H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| First is Jessica Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=690)|
| 0:11:40| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Jessica Dean, 2030 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Thank you, Mayor, for your research on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| and your communication with our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Thank you to Councilman Dan Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| and our new Councilman Gwen McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| for communicating with us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| And thank you to Councilman Stair and Campin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| for taking the time to walk the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| since the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| I ask the Council to table or postpone this proposed expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| so that we, the residents of Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| might participate in an equitable and inclusive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| to develop policy and actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| to address all housing concerns in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| I live in the proposed expansion area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| I rented my home from August 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| until I purchased it in December 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| I am a low-income homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| I work four jobs, and it took a lot of convincing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| for TVA to grant me a loan to buy my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| In Park Ridge, we have incredibly passionate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| They're passionate about preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| of both people and structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| There are valid points for many facets of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| However, the current overlay only validates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| the means and methods of preserving structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| not necessarily the people who reside in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| I'm not an expert in any of these fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| but I care about my community deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| I have ideas that have been unwelcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| and unheard in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| and I share them in hopes you'll get to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| this is not a simple for or against preservation battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| I'm not against my neighbors who advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| for building preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| I am simply for a different process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| that includes advocating for all people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| who reside in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| The people whose voices have been marginalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| in this top-down process include renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| including KCDC voucher holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| elders and longtime residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| black residents, immigrants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| and most especially the intersections of these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| Park Ridge's situation must be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| in context of the housing situation in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Rental unit supply is below demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| KCDC's voucher demand exceeds their supply of vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| Poverty level in Knoxville is at 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| which is close to Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| and greater than Greenville, South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Little Rock, and Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| We've lost over 700 voucher units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| and people who rent spend an average of 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| of their income on rental properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| DH1 is a medicine that treats one symptom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| of a much larger issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| and I'm afraid of the side effects of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| I'm afraid that it will make it harder for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| to afford to repair my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| I'm afraid that homes will continue to be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| from KCDC rental homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| to single-family owner-occupied homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| And I realize by saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| I'm a person who has actually done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| I purchased my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| But we've got to think about all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| in the context of H1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| and whose voices we want to contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| to the possibilities for Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| I'm asking for a preservation model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| that values and preserves people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| not just property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| As the recode process will review the H1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Knoxville has an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| to create this type of model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Some ideas that might be restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| by an H1 designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| before the recode process is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| The legalization of accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| infill development on empty lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| using tiny houses or subdividing of lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| perhaps duplex or triplex units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| that fit the scale of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| and developer incentives for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| and residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| that would accept vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| or encourage rent stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| These are just some of my ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| and hopes for Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Imagine if all of our passion and knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| and hopes were empowered to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| a great future for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| I ask for your help and assistance in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| to create a community-driven process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| of preserving people, preserving culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| and preserving the heritage of Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Now, Brittany Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Brittany, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Brittany Allen, 2058 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| I come to you all on behalf of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| who have vouchers, who live in Section 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| under the subsidized housing living programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| As a mother and people who are connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| to low-income subsidized living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| I have this question for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| and keep this in your mind and in your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| What will it take, or do you have the tolerance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| for the negativity and the hatred that this is causing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| or if it shall pass, do you have the tolerance for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| due to the forced hatred and the division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| that this is already causing or it will cause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| This historical expectation that has presented itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| has brought about a sense of rejection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| and with one another, separation from the movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| has presented itself to break up rooms from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| because of what it seems it needs to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| but not necessarily knowing what people are suffering from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| because of what they have earned over their lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| It has caused emotional stresses that has rippled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| not only from just in the community but within the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| because of the scares of what shall come to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| in the future for their lifestyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| because of a panic of just surviving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| lasting damage that could cause them to have mental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| and unable to cope of what's next, what shall come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| how will we make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Neighbors are just feuding and just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| is it your fault or is it their fault?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Who's fault is it really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| The meaning of that and this and that and other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| of all the false representation of just a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| which means the common goal, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| Why not aim to stabilize, set something that's in reach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| be realistic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Community teaches us one thing, to be connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| to those who will run and just run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| and to run as hard as those that we are connected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| or even greater, but not to count out anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| or leave nobody behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| History teaches us another thing, to be a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| in every moment and every minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| because situations change but people continue to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Survival is not just for one person or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| but it's for everyone who's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| Being a mother of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| and living on government assistance is not a struggle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| but it's an opportunity for me to survive at a greater level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| I always wonder why I had to live beyond my means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| but it's not necessarily living beyond my means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| it's just having a greater opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| to find something bigger, and it's bigger than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| History teaches us how it impacts us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| and how we will deal with it with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Working together is not just being historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| Many see this as an impossible situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| and I see this as a lack of compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| and maybe others see that it's not about really the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| Maybe it's just about personal desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Maybe it's just about personal views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Maybe it's just about having a vision that meets a personal need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| but many just see this as a personal community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| This is a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| This is not nothing more or nothing less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| A community builds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| A community reaches out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| A community relates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| So how would this affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| How would this affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| It will take jobs away if people with Section 8 are affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| It will affect the rates of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| It will lower so many things in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| So if this hinders us, then it hinders not only our inner community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| but it would hinder our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| So I ask you to not just look at the outer side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| but look on the inside of the people who's connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| And now Nikki Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| Here, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Hi, my name is Nikki Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| I live at 2107 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| I currently reside in the historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1269)|
| 0:21:18| Around one year ago, my husband and I decided to build a shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Not realizing that sheds were included in the historic guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| we set out to build one based on our understanding of the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and our observation that the last three that had been built in the previous month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| in the historical overlay consisted of a metal building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| shipping container, and a prefab shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| We rectified our error, and we got our certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| We thought we were doing the right thing by following the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| even though they were not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| And we ended up having to put much more money and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| than our neighbors who did not follow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| because someone decided to report us and not them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Violation of the current guidelines happen often in the current historical overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| And the enforcement of them are purely based on whether a neighbor reports it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| resulting in a greater financial burden to some more than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| So why would we extend the historical overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| when the current one is inequitably enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| I would like to see a pattern of consistent enforcement in the current overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| before an expansion is considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| In 2006, I graduated from the University of Tennessee with a degree in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| So I was asked to speak just from my observations as a resident through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| In my study and as a profession as a planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| I have several questions that I have raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| and I would like to raise now before the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| According to the 2014 Central City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| historical overlay was to be examined in the 15-year improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| There was also a five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| When their owners, talking of those with historic buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| desired the protection of the local historic designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| I do not believe much has changed in the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| to warrant such a rapid implementation of this goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| In fact, several alternatives to historical overlay have been suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| such as the NC1 overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| the application to the heart of Knoxville Residential District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| and recommendations that have been found in the recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| In my opinion, historic overlay as a land-use tool is the most restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| and the most costly one to private citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| So let's first start with less restrictive and less costly regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| and intermittently expand the use and scope of those land-use tools available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| before applying historic overlay to over 400 homes in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| I do feel like those who have questioned the overlay have not been listened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| It seemed like a done deal from the first meeting in February of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| At the open house meeting in February conducted by the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| I did hear concerns voiced from neighborhood residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| about their own increase in home maintenance costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| if they had to follow historic guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| absentee landlords, the safety of dilapidated housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| rising rents and cost of homeownership, disrepair of sidewalks, crime, and many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| Obviously, residents of Park Ridge have the firsthand knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| about what is most pressing in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| and if given the chance, we could provide our own suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| for the appropriate land-use tools for our community in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| if we were led through a participatory process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And I'm thankful that both Jenny and Ms. Trent also suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| that we begin a process that is more participatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| that even asks, is this something that the homeowners want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| As it is stated in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| there are several percentages that have been thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| At the highest, only 10% of those who are homeowners in the expansion area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| requested that this be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| As we move forward, I would like to not only move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| as both I and Jessica and Brittany have suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| but also just to be asked, is this something that we want or is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| Okay, Council, those are the people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| One thing I would like to ask Charles, just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| I think Council is aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| but just to clarify what the effect of postponing does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| for the actual existing ordinance as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| Well, the motion as it's presently stated is to postpone for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| both F and G, F being the guidelines provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| and G being the rezoning position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| With respect to the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| the effect would be that it would come back in six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| if this motion would be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| It would come back in six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| and Council would consider guidelines at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| based on this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| On the rezoning measure, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| there is a provision of the code that says in a rezoning measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| there is a 120-day limit within which a proposed rezoning has to be acted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| or it will be taken as denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| And so if you postponed it for six months on G, the rezoning measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| it would get put back on the agenda in that six-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| And when it came back, it would be taken as denied at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| because that would be past the 120-day time limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| which ends, as I have calculated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| it runs from the time of the initial hearing at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| and that was on October the 12th of 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| and would run out on February the 9th of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| Now, that would not keep you from moving forward with an H-1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| It could not be the exact same overlay for a year period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| but, frankly, based on historical experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| it's unlikely that it would be exactly the same overlay anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| You could change it in any number of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| and then it wouldn't be the exact same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| that would run into that year period of time when you couldn't come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| but you would really restart the process if you wait for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| You'll be restarting the process after that six-month period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Or you could restart it any time during those six months if you chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Fair enough. That's true, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Okay, just so everyone's clear on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| and I think that's why, actually, the next...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Can I ask if that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| that if they started looking at the ordinance before February the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| you would be within the period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Do you have to wrap it up or does it must be completed within 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| or it's deemed denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| It has to be acted upon within that 120-day period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| and I think we're pretty much in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| that that means you have to either pass it or deny it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| And if you haven't passed it, then it's going to be deemed denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| But again, it doesn't preclude from starting on another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| starting the effort and building upon all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| that's already been gathered on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| And I think that's also why the next item after these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| is your proposal to add something to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| which would address the issue of a moratorium on demolition during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| Yeah, I'm just afraid that a crack would be opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| and we'd inadvertently allow demolition that no one wants to see happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| unless there's an emergency and you need to deal with a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Right, and that's why we'll get to your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| and the one that we've got, you and I have on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| We have to span that period if we're going to go out six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| We have to span that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| It sounds as though both sides are interested in a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| but one of the questions that was asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| what does the administration plan to do during this time period that they asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| What do you have in mind doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Well, what I've heard from both sides is a willingness for mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| to reach out and to try and bring the sides together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| I would immediately, we would work with Mayor Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| and with Council Member-elect Gwen McKenzie to try and identify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| you know, those folks who want to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| those who want to continue and try to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| You have to have willing partners for any of this to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| So we don't have the plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| A lot of it depends on the conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| I would say we initially have conversations with the various parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| who have shown an interest to continue to work on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| and to seek and then to begin a process to identify what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| Part of this is, part of the issues raised are not even H1 issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| They're about affordability, about blighted property, about slumlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| So what are the issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| How can we address those or how are we addressing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| or what more do we need to do through community development that addresses that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| So people, so if there is support for H1, then what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| you need to address all of that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| And so that would be the direction we're moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| But in terms of not knowing how this, you know, what would be decided tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| and what the desires of the community is to continue to work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| we don't have a set plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| I don't think we can set a plan for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| All we can do is say here are some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| What do you all agree to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| You know, you all have to agree to what the plan is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| Are you interested, like Ms. Trent mentioned, about having a third party?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| Yeah, actually, that was brought up months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| and we would be very interested if the parties accept that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| to have something like community mediation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| We would love that because that's a third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| They're very skilled, as Kim Trent mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| They have been very effective in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| We would welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| We would support that financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| I will commit to that now as a city to help you all if that is something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| But both sides have to come in willing to work with the mediation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| So that's definitely something that we would pursue if there is interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Yeah, Mayor, might I suggest since from what I've been hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| and I suppose what you've been hearing is perhaps the initial action should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| like a community meeting where they talk about options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| and things they want to see on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| so that hopefully you move towards a mediation or some other process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| but you get to hear the different voices say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| here's how we think our concern can be resolved or should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| Maybe that won't add anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| but it might be a way of just getting people to start talking about solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| rather than anger over which direction are we going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| Yeah, I think we'll have to decide whether you start the public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| or whether you start with some smaller meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| where we can start to see where the fault lines are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| and where the common lines are for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| So just if you would just give us some time working with folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| to figure out what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| I'll just throw it out as a thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| When I first heard about the effort to postpone it or table it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| I was a little hesitant for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| One, it is kicking it to another council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| so we're going to have nine different people look in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| And then the other thing was typically a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| things that are tabled never get brought back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| But I've spoken with administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| I feel like they really are committed to creating a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| and understand that a lot of work is put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| And I've spoken with a lot of people on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| and there's a lot of things that are in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| I mean, I think one thing that's clear is that everybody really loves the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| And I guess that stayed in the obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| And it's also sort of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| It seems that everyone really doesn't want it to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| And one side's focused on the historic fabric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| and one side's focused on displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| And I think both of those are very worthy goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| and worthy concerns going forward as investment comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| So I'm going to support Mayor Brown's postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| But I just encourage everyone, and I'm trying to do it myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| to take a step back, to listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| and to really put on our thinking caps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| and see what we can do to address the concerns that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Okay, are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| We're first voting on 9F, which is postponing the historic design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| That passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| The next is 9G, the actual rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| That passes unanimously as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| We now have, that is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| So, Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Yes, well, the next item on our agenda is adding motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| and I would like to add an item by motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| and that is a proposed ordinance that would, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| put in place a moratorium on demolition from the beginning of February 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| out 150 days or six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| or whatever we agree is the appropriate time frame to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| That way there will be no gap where the original moratorium lapses for inaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| according to what Mr. Swanson told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| and we would not have someone rushing in to do improper demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| just because there's no action on the H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| I think you now have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| I put a copy on the Council forum yesterday or the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| It has a slight revision in your copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| One was lawyers thought we should have a better description of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| so the attachment has the meets and bounds kind of stuff that tells you where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| as well as the maps that show the affected area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| and there's nothing new in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Those are the same things that are being talked about as historic overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| but that's the area of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| The document basically has some whereas clauses that tell us that we're in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| We want to preserve the housing while we study the solution with the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| and so we're asking for a moratorium for 150 days or six months if that's more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| And I'd like to add, thank you, Councilman Dellavopi, for bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| I appreciate Mr. Frost and Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| We worked on this today to extend this, to make this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| Already there is an existing moratorium until February 3rd, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| February 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Well, it's two different, whichever one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| It depends on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Right, early February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Since it's going to die by operation of the code because it's not operated on within 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| that date would be February 9th when effectively it would be dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| So be cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Be cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| I would start that moratorium then on, like, February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| That's what we put in here is February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| So this says February 1st, and we are proposing 150 days from February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2260)|
| 0:37:47| That was the length of the billboard moratorium, I understand, for Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| so there's precedent for having a moratorium that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Right, and there's two more months in between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| so we really have those five months plus the two months that are going on under the old moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| Right, so now in order for this to get added to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| you need 100% of all of council to agree to add this to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| If it didn't get added now, it could come back in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| but I think everyone would be glad to just address this today, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| The motion and agenda, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| So there's a motion, was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| So this is a motion to add this to the agenda, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Okay, we have a motion and a second to add this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| This is just adding it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Okay, it is added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| So now before you is a motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| You're making the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| I can, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| I didn't know if we were taking it up later now, but, yeah, I make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| I'd say we do it right now, without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| Because that's been the subject matter, what we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| A motion that we approve this proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| which puts in place that temporary ordinance from February 1, 150 days out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| and protects against demolition permits being issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| except in the case where the chief building official thinks there's some emergency that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| For basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| We can't, yeah, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Do I need to read this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Yes, he should read this into the, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| This is an emergency ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| enacting a moratorium of 150 days upon the granting of permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| authorizing demolition of structures within property bounded generally by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| or located on East Glenwood Avenue from I-40 to Spruce Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| Washington Avenue from the Standard Knitting Mill Complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| to North Chestnut Street, Jefferson, Woodvine, and East 5th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| and from the Standard Knitting Mill Complex to North Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| Okay, I'm told by the law director I should put this in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Without objection, we'll amend the rules and hear this out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| I hear no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| Okay, so you've heard, do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Yes, I have so moved that we adopt the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| And you've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| The ayes have it, and the moratorium will exist for 150 days after February 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| Okay, that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| For that item, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| There's nothing else on the H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Yes, Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| I want to say that it still troubles me a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| and I feel like I have some responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| and it's also the fact that we've had people working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| Microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| We've had people working together for the last two years to come up with a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| and then all of a sudden it's almost as though at the last minute we dropped this bomb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| in terms of how we're going to finally get involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| And so I just want to say that I hope that we've learned from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| because we've had numerous hours, not only an MPC and Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| and people involved in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| and it's troubling to me a little bit that we've kind of come in at the last minute here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| and made these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| So I just want to say that for the record that I have a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| And, you know, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| And we've talked to, Gerald and I have talked, our staff has talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| and we need to talk with the continuing and new council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| You know, the way this came was that council made a vote and asked MPC to work on an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| And so what we need to do in the future is that when council wants something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| we really need to get it as part of city staff and MPC work plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| because, you know, you all are part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| You don't have the ability, you know, you've got great staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| but their job isn't to facilitate meetings and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| and to work with MPC the way it would have been good for us to have done in hindsight now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| But that was their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| They did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| They did what they were supposed to do, and kudos to MPC and Kay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| But what this has pointed out is that, you know, often when something comes to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| there may be other factors that really need to be worked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| And so I regret that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| That's why I'm bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| I think we can learn from this, and I would hope that future councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| and the administration will learn from it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| But I think we do want to thank all the work and effort that has been put into it by MPC and Kay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| By all the people who have gathered the data and all, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| If I could add just one, Nickelsworth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| The flip side of that is that I think it's good that this council can sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| and listen to the community saying we're still not happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| we're still troubled by certain aspects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| and the healthy thing is to step aside and take another look and involve everyone in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| so that hopefully the solutions fit the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| and we have both housing protection and people protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| So we're going to move on to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| We're now on consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Was there anything else to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| I don't think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| We have 11 N through O certificates of compliance, 11 P through Q pensions, 12 F through J 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| Move for approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| So council, for the mayor's report, as we all know, we had an election two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| You want to wait for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Allow people to leave as they wish before we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2611)|
| 0:43:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| So we had an election two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| We want to congratulate all of the winners, Stephanie Welch, Andrew Roberto, Seema Singh-Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| Lauren Ryder, and Gwen McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| I don't know if anybody is with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Gwen was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Gwen was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| And also we want to thank all the candidates who ran this year and all of the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| came out to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| This was one of the largest turnouts in a non-mayoral election in nearly 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| As a reminder, the new council members will be sworn in here in this room at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| on Saturday, December 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| I hope everyone will join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| I look forward to working with all of the new council members as well as those of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| who will continue on for the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Of course, that means that we are also close to saying goodbye to the five of you who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| departing council next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| So I want to say a few words to you now because I won't be here at the December 5th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| I'm actually going to be in Chicago for the North American Mayor Summit on Climate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| Energy and hopefully to pick up an international award for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| Knoxville is a finalist for a C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| The recognition is for our KEEM program, our Knoxville Extreme Energy Makeover Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| which was nominated in the energy efficiency category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| So you may recall KEEM was funded by a generous $15 million grant from TVA and it provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| free whole home energy efficiency upgrades to nearly 1,300 lower income families and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| educated more than 1,700 residents on how to take control of their utility bills through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| energy saving habits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| So they were nominated and were one of the finalists up against Austin, Texas, Chicago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| Illinois, Qingdao, China, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Vancouver, Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| And that's a pretty impressive list of finalists here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| So I'll be representing our KEEM partners who made this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| That's CAC, KUB, the Alliance to Save Energy, and the City's Office of Sustainability, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| of course all of the families who participated in this program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| But that also means that this will be my last council meeting with the five of you who are leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| So I want to publicly say, and I don't want to take up too much time because we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| have many other things on the agenda, but I do want to publicly say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you for all of the things that we have accomplished together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| Thank you for taking your roles as council members so seriously for the past eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| Your district constituents and all Knoxville constituents have been very well represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| This has been a really exciting time for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Look at how much has changed in your eight years and in our six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| You've all been a very important part of making those things happen, both citywide and in your own districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| I started thinking about all the things, and I can't list them all, so just a couple of things come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| We've worked to invest strategically in all areas across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| Our pension system is on firmer footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| We improved and expanded our parks and our greenways and our urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| We started a very special affordable housing fund and an historic preservation fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| You have supported and advocated for projects, too many to list here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| that will have a positive impact on the life of our city and our residents for generations to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| and that is no exaggeration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| You've made a tremendous difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Mayor Brown, I want to especially recognize you for being willing to step forward and serve as interim mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| after Mayor Haslam became governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| It says a lot about your thoughtfulness and your even temper that your colleagues entrusted you with that role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| and you served us all well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| We have two vice mayors departing, Vice Mayor Duane Greve and former Vice Mayor Nick Pavlis, who's my councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2857)|
| 0:47:46| Thanks to both of you for your leadership on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| You have both been willing to roll up your sleeves and wrestle some very complicated and difficult issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| You won't be mad at me if I said it's like herding cats at times, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| You know, everyone's got their own opinions, and it's a tough job to be vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| But you have really set high standards for vice mayors to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| and my administration has been very happy to work with you all in that leadership role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| Councilwoman Palmer, you have for years taken on one of the most thankless jobs, chairing the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| That's never an easy job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| I served on the Beer Board and County Commission, and I'm glad to never have to do something like that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| But it has become even more complicated in recent years because of all the changes in the ways and places that people want to sell and drink beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| And the whole brewery explosion has been an important part of our urban revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| And by the way, it's one of the 11 factors listed by James Fallows of the Atlantic as keys to a thriving city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| So we have a thriving city if you base it on all of our breweries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| So thank you for helping steer through all of that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| Councilman Della Vopi, you were never shy about asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| Trying to overcome that shyness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| And even down to the footnotes in the agenda packet, you made sure, and I mean this sincerely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| you made sure that the public knew what council was voting on and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| So thank you for your dedication to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| So you've all heard me say many times how lucky I am to have a strong, effective council to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| This is reinforced for me when I talk to other mayors around the country who are not so fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| And believe me, they talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Having served on a legislative body myself for eight years as a Knox County Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| I know firsthand the demands on your time and the complexity of the issues you grapple with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| which is supposed to be a part-time job, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| So I want all of you, including those who will still be here for the next two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| to know how much I do appreciate working with you and the working relationship that we have developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Your service has demonstrated how deeply you care about our city and the people who live and work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| And can we have a round of applause for these councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=2998)|
| 0:50:15| Now for a few holiday announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| I saw Brenda. Brenda hates for those kind of things, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| She wants to get on with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| But it was important to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Thank you for letting me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| So for a few holiday announcements, I hope you all have a great Thanksgiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| with your family and friends this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| City offices will be closed Thursday and Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| and there will be no garbage or recycle pickup on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| However, if you normally have Thursday trash collection, that will happen Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| and the normal Friday pickups will happen on Saturday, so just a day late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| And as you know, after Thanksgiving comes Christmas in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| and I want to invite everyone to come join us this Friday evening, November 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| for the tree lighting at our annual Regal Celebration of Lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| Music will start at 5.30 p.m. in the Crouch Park Extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| followed by the tree lighting at 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| so bring your whole family downtown for the festivities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| Friday also kicks off the season for our Holidays on Ice skating rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| I think that opens at 9 a.m. that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| And it will be open from November 24th to January 7th, except for Christmas Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| And the next Friday, December 1st, will be the annual WIVK Christmas Parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| which will roll up Gay Street starting at 7 p.m. that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| You can find information on all of that, plus more holiday events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| on our city website at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| And that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Council reports? Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| I'd like to suspend the rules and read a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| Without objection from Council, we will amend the rules and allow for this to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| This is a very special resolution by Council and the Beer Board Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| Whereas Council Member Brenda Palmer was selected to serve as Chair of the Beer Board on December 17th, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| and whereas as Chair of the Beer Board, Brenda Palmer took her duty seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| due to the nature of the substance which was governed by the Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| and whereas Brenda Palmer presided over approximately 70 Beer Board meetings through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| always attempting to run the meetings in an efficient manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| and whereas as Chair of the Beer Board, Brenda Palmer presided over possibly as many as 1,000 Beer Permits applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3150)|
| 0:52:40| and whereas Brenda Palmer's duty as Beer Board Chair was very time-consuming outside of the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| as applicants and businesses would contact her during all hours of the day and night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| often providing a wide range of requests and excuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| and whereas Chair Brenda Palmer always tried to handle all situations in a professional manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| and whereas the Council of the City of Knoxville and its Beer Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| appreciate and will miss Brenda Palmer's service as Chair of the Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Council of the City of Knoxville and its Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| the Council of the City of Knoxville and its Beer Board hereby officially recognize Beer Board Chair Brenda Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| for her service and leadership as the Beer Board Chair for so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| This resolution shall take effect from and after its passage, the welfare of the city requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| Brenda, thanks so much for all you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| Wait a minute. I need to get a vote to make sure that's official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| That's a motion. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Any opposed? I think it passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| We all had a beer. Now it would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3224)|
| 0:53:57| Maybe we could meet afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Okay, now, elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| Mayor, I want to add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| I think Ms. Palmer is the first female to serve as a Beer Board Chair, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| so that needs to be recognized as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| She broke that ground, so I just want to add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3263)|

| 0:57:30| So we're on the short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3450)|

| 0:57:39| So we'll start with those who are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Debra Olson, followed by Daniel Wallace, and then Ann Langendorfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3461)|

| 0:57:54| Debra Olson, 6700 East Dick Ford Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3474)|
| 0:58:02| I didn't really understand how all of this process worked in government until I began being involved in short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| because it does affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| I guess I'm confused why we are still here trying to convince the minority that this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| We are 10 to 15 meetings in about a year with still no proof that STRs are a bad idea for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| Those against it, their greatest reason is out of fear, fear of what if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| There are no complaints other than code violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| STRs have been operating for at least three to five years in the city of Knoxville with over 8,000 stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| The complaints are only ordinance-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| STRs are not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| There are more positive reasons than negative, especially in areas that are being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| I know you all have heard me speak before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I am in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| There are no hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| Well, there's a few, but none that families will want to come stay at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| Families come to South Knoxville to utilize the things that Knoxville is promoting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| If we shut down the STRs, then where will these people stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| I have a, for instance, I have seven ladies coming in to stay in my house for 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| They are attending South College for a physical therapy clinical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| What hotel will allow seven ladies to stay in one room with a kitchen, a living room, a dining room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| They bring in a whiteboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| This is the second time they've stayed with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| They bring in a whiteboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| They study together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| You shut this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| You shut down type 3, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| My ladies want to come back every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| This is something that if you close it down, there are so many people that will be affected coming into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3595)|
| 1:00:10| I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| I meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| I read their notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| I read their letters, how thankful they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| I provide them a home away from home, and that's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3614)|
| 1:00:22| This method of travel is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| It is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| It is in every city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Let's regulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Grandfather us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Grandfather the non-owner occupants in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3631)|

| 1:00:38| We don't have any complaints against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Let us stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Let us stay in our communities that we're in, that we're trying to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| In that, I ask that you pass type 3 non-owner occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3651)|

| 1:01:00| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| Hi, my name is Daniel Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| I live at 2443 Buffett Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| Thank you so much for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| I've lived in Knoxville for over five years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| I'm not actually American, but I'm an American in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| I'm from Great Britain originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| I really love the neighborhoods of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| It's a pleasure to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| I own a house in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| I love being there, and I think that it's great to regulate Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| I encourage this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| There's definitely, as well, a variety of neighborhoods in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| I sometimes think that we hear about this vision of a neighborhood that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| I don't know, it sounds like everyone's house is a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| and no one visits that area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| Where I live, I've seen homes empty for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| Someone on my street, they left their home vacant for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| Clearly, they didn't think it was worth renting it out or getting it fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| Whittlesprings has a patch of dead businesses that just stay vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| for a really long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| It just seems to me that their neighbors, perhaps they are R1 regulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3738)|
| 1:02:25| but they benefit from this Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| They benefit from this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| Just as other people said, people coming in to see the area, get to know the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| spend money in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| I just think more life, more business is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| I'm encouraging this idea of allowing people to have some level of investment properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| in Airbnb or grandfathering in people who already have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Now Ann Langendorfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| My name is Ann Langendorfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| I'm at 2921 Arbor Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| I spoke with you all two weeks ago about Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| I myself am not, in some ways, not of vested interest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| I don't have an Airbnb property currently, but as I said last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| I do have a mother-in-law suite that we were renting out for the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| and so we've learned a little bit about becoming landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| I just want to say, Knoxville is the city where I'm becoming an adult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| I was telling my friend on the way here that this is the place where I'm learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| how to be a good neighbor, how to learn to get along with my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| My home was purchased for almost three times the price of my neighbor's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3821)|
| 1:03:50| He bought his property at auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| On our block, which is full of beautiful homes from the 1940s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| it also shares the same street with homes from the 1960s and the 19-teens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| It's a very mixed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| We have a lot of different properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| The next block over from us has a lot of rental properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| We sometimes hear gunshots from local areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| This is real Knoxville to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| When people talk about scruffy city, we live in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| We chose to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| My husband and I, we make more than most people in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| We chose that neighborhood because we want to live the way that we think people should live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| They should know their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| They should give the money to the city so that the city is a good place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| We should spend money in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| So what does this have to do with Airbnb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| I think that the point needs to be made again that a better city is a city that's not scared of its neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| and that knows what's happening next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| So I supported the regulations for Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| and I'd like to see that kind of support and regulation extended to these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| that are already being operated, the non-owner-occupant homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| I think that the reason that I see this being of value is because we already live in a city that's full of rentals, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| And I was trying to think, like, what's the real difference between these short-term rentals and the long-term rentals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3924)|
| 1:05:32| I actually see short-term rentals as properties that are being better taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| This sounds crazy in a way, but if you think about it from the perspective of somebody who has a short-term rental unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| that they're using for income property, they have to go into that rental every three days, every 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3945)|
| 1:05:55| Most of the short-term rentals, we're talking, like, on a weekly basis or even more often than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| And that means you have to go in and you have to do all of the housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| You have to repair anything that's been broken while you're out, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| while someone's been there using the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| A long-term rental, I mean, I was a long-term renter for years and years and years, for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3976)|
| 1:06:25| My landlord didn't see my property when I lived there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| Unless something broke, I didn't call him and he didn't come into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| I mean, he could drive by and make sure that I had picked up my trash or, you know, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| But he had no rights to see the inside of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| So in some ways, these short-term rentals are actually homes that are being seen more by the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4003)|
| 1:06:50| and they're being cared for more carefully because you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| In order to get somebody to rent your property on Airbnb or VRBO or any of these other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| you've got to be there. You've got to make sure everything's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| So I think that it would be worth thinking again about what are you saying about these non-owner-occupied properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4025)|
| 1:07:14| when you know that these are properties that people are checking up on on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4034)|
| 1:07:21| So thank you. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| Okay, now speaking against it is Mr. Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| Thank you for being here. Larry, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you. My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| I'm speaking tonight on behalf of Community Forum, but also for many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| On November 7, 2017, I mentioned that Community Forum acts as an advocate for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| We approved a resolution on May 10, 2017, stating a resolution on behalf of the community forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| on May 10, 2017, stating our opposition to allowing short-term rentals in residential zoning districts R1 and R1E in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4078)|
| 1:08:06| Since that time, 10 neighborhood associations have approved similar resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| I read their names tonight because they are some of the largest and longest established neighborhoods in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4091)|
| 1:08:19| Their boards, in most cases, unanimously approved these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| Large numbers of people attended general meetings of their neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| There was near unanimous opposition at these meetings to this ordinance as drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| I want the record to be clear tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| City Council and the city of Knoxville administration has heard us, but has not listened to the voices of its citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| residing in Alice Bell Spring Hill, Forest Heights, Fountain City Town Hall, Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| Norwood, Pond Gap, Tazewell Pike-Beverly Station, Wesley Neighbors, West Hills, and Westmoreland Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4129)|
| 1:08:57| Therefore, Community Forum, along with these 10 neighborhoods, plus many other individuals from other neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| once again requests that you reconsider your position and support Councilman Grieve's amendment to exclude short-term rentals from R1 and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4143)|
| 1:09:13| Likewise, we support Councilman Grieve's amendment requiring permit applicants to provide a mailed notice of the submission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4153)|
| 1:09:20| of an application of a Type I permit to adjacent property owners and the neighborhood association where the property is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4160)|
| 1:09:28| It is our understanding that Councilman Pavlis will offer an amendment which would allow someone who has already been operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| in violation of Knoxville's regulations and ordinance to be allowed to continue to operate beyond the parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| of the currently proposed ordinance for one year from the effective date of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| Community Forum opposes this amendment as it would set a very bad precedent for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| It has been said for the past several months, and again two weeks ago, that this proposed ordinance is a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| because there was no consensus in the community. I think it is necessary to make a brief response to that assertion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| The real debate on a policy issue does not begin until an ordinance has been made public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| In this case, the first draft was dated March 31, 2017. It was very slightly revised on April 25, 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4213)|
| 1:10:22| due to concerns from the fire marshal about how many people should be allowed to stay at a given location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| It was slightly revised again before the issue went to MPC for the second time on October 12, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4228)|
| 1:10:35| The point I wish to make is that there was never a compromise regarding the position taken by the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| which started approving resolutions about R1 and R1E beginning in April and May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| There was a big crowd at a public meeting on April 4, a large crowd from many District 2 neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| at a meeting at the Greek Orthodox Church on May 8, a large meeting in West Hills on May 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| City Council workshops on June 29, April 3, and August 10, MPC meetings May 11 and October 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4260)|
| 1:11:09| Representatives from Community Forum and these ten neighborhoods and others spoke at all of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| Many people have written or called you since April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| Unfortunately, nothing that was said at all of those meetings and workshops resulted in any compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| on the issues of great concern to the neighborhoods who approved resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| None of Councilman Grieve's amendments passed two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| So while different points of view may have been considered in drafting the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| no compromises were ever made to address our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| I would also suggest that there has been an overwhelming consensus opposed to the ordinance as drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| when compared to the several hundred people who have been currently improperly operating short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| and have advocated for fewer restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Yes, we have heard assurances from those who said we would never do anything that would harm our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| I'm very sorry to say, but we don't find those assurances of any comfort whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| Regardless of what happens tonight, Community Forum and the neighborhoods I have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| will continue to work to get this ordinance changed in the future in an effort to protect our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| Thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Okay, Council, that's the last of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| Council, you wish to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| Yes, I'm seeing nodded heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| She didn't sign up ahead of time, so I guess I'll see a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| Which side is she on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Are you against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| I'm neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| You're neither?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| How are you helping us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| And it's brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| It's very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| I say that we hear the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Let me see a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Who wants to hear it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| That's all I can do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| One, two, three, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Okay, go ahead, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| First of all, I apologize for not signing up ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| I was running late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Anyway, my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| Also, my mistake to delude you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| And I'm speaking as a board member of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4411)|
| 1:13:39| I'm speaking both on behalf of the League and its president, Linda McCabe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| And in the email that I sent to you on their behalf this noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| I emphasized that while the League has not taken a position on the short-term write-alone ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4431)|
| 1:13:59| we don't have the basis to do so because we can only take positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| if we've adopted positions that support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| We still have deep concern about the notification amendment that failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| or the failure of that amendment on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| And this concern is based on a core League principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| which is that citizens should be notified of prospective government actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4464)|
| 1:14:31| especially if they are very likely to affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| In good government, that's a fundamental right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| In the case of short-term rentals and residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| this notification can and arguably should be done by the permit applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| but the government should require that this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| Notification to perfectedly affected others is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| It's transparent governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| It's not governance in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| In addition, though, there is a pragmatic reason for notifying adjacent owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| of a prospective short-term rental arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Section 3.4 of the proposed ordinance addresses complaints and how they will be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4516)|
| 1:15:25| It says that if the city finds the complaint to be supported by a preponderance of the evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4525)|
| 1:15:33| it may revoke the permit or take other enforcement action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| Now, surely this complaint, this provision for complaint-driven enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| will be improved, not diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| If a property owner has, first, prior notification that the adjacent property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| is in fact holding a short-term rental permit or about to get one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| and second, they need to have clear information on how to report a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| So, on behalf of the League, we respectfully request that you reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4572)|
| 1:16:20| the notification amendment that failed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| I mean, is this a position or a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| I thought you said you didn't have a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| No, I said I did not have a position on the STR amendment per se, a coordinance per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| What I am speaking to specifically is one amendment that's been proposed to that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| Do you have a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| Okay, that concludes the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| May I go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Yes, Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| This has been, gosh, we've about worn this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| but I would like to try for two additional or two amendments once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| And I want to make it clear that in talking with my constituents in neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| this is not a fear factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| This is philosophically an issue that is felt very strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| that a number of these people feel that a residence or an R1 or an R1E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| is really a single-family residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| A lot of the folks who moved into these areas, this is what they expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| They didn't expect short-term rentals or other kinds of businesses to come into their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| So it's really a philosophical issue about what we really think a residential district is or ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4661)|
| 1:17:49| I have a real concern that, as I mentioned last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| that where do we stop once we allow the short-term rentals into our single-family residential areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4672)|
| 1:18:01| Is this just the beginning of something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| So, therefore, I would like to propose two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| The first amendment is that I'd like to move to amend 2.3A.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| to exclude the R1 and R1E zoning districts in districts where short-term rentals are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4694)|
| 1:18:23| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Okay, I'm sorry. I was asking him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| So the motion was to agree, and the second was Dela Vothe, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Repeat the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| To amend 2.3A.J to exclude R1 and R1E zoning districts as districts where short-term rental units are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4720)|
| 1:18:51| In other words, basically to remove them from those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| The other thing, too, if I may say, you know, we just got through dealing with a situation in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| that had to do with a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| And we've all said in the last couple of weeks that there was so much division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| that it was such a divisive issue that we wanted to postpone it and put it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| And that was just one small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| But what we're looking at here, it's obvious that we have ten-plus neighborhoods throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| which we have a very decisive issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| So, you know, are we being consistent in what we're thinking about here on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| I'd just like to throw that out also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| But that's my motion, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| I think it fails 6-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| 6-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| Fails 2-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Okay, go ahead, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| The next amendment I'd like to try for is the notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| And I'd like to make a motion that this would be required notification for type 1 operating permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4798)|
| 1:20:08| that the owner shall provide notice of their application for a type 1 operating permit in the following ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| One is by mail and one is by signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Do you want me to read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| It's the same as I introduced last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| I think everyone is familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| Did we split it twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| You split it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Okay, well, then we'll split it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| The owner shall provide notice of their application for a type 1 operating permit in the following way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| By mail, within 48 hours of submitting the application for a type 1 operating permit to the Business License and Tax Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| the owner shall send a neighborhood notification form supplied by the Business License and Tax Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| by the first class mail to the neighborhood association, if applicable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| and all property owners whose property is adjacent to the property at which the short-term rental unit is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| And I think that one of the comments I want to make about this is that, as Ms. English brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4858)|
| 1:21:06| in essence what we've done right now, we're forcing the short-term rentals onto our R1 and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| The least we could do is to notify those neighbors of what's happening to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| So that's my first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| So that's the motion that's on the mail notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| Is adjacent next door, behind, across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| What's adjacent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| It's adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Circular, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| I'm thinking next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Across the street wouldn't be notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| Last time we had the proposal of how it was done in the City of Portland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| I think it did notify the across-the-street neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| All the neighbors around will be notified by mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| Across the street, adjacent, diagonal, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Wait, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| You said adjacent's adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Is across-the-street adjacent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| I mean, this is a, what Vice Mayor Grieve started with was originally how MPC does things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| MPC mails 200 feet all the way around, and this is a smaller notification system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4937)|
| 1:22:27| Like I said, it was patterned after what's been used in Portland, Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| Honestly, I don't have the Portland paperwork with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| Here comes Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| So you have a little 200-foot ring, basically, the properties that are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| No, it's just adjacent, and across-the-street is adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| He said MPC considers across-the-street to be adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| And the Portland thing that was provided to me shows across-the-street as getting the notice as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| So that's what your motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| Yes, the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Okay, and we have a second to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| I have two or three points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| First of all, we don't have a fiscal note attached to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| so we don't know how much it's going to cost to make these notifications, and I think that's a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| The homeowner does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| Secondly, no, he said the business tax office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| They provide the form for the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| They provide the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| My mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| The second thing is, if I have a lot of relatives and friends who come to my house on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| perhaps on the weekends, I don't send a notice to my neighbors saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| well, my cousins are coming in this weekend, or my friends from college are coming in this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| And I think that this is a really preposterous concept that you're going to have to notify somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| If I want to rent my house on a long-term rental, I don't have to send a notice to anybody either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| So this whole notification process to me seems to be rather short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5045)|
| 1:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Brenda, thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Mine differ slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| I think it's just common courtesy that you notify your neighbors if you're going to engage in this activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| I did support this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| The rest of it I did not support, but this particular part I do support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| I think you need to notify your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| Vice Mayor Grave, another comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| I was just going to say that you're not charging your relatives to come and visit you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| as opposed to running a business, which is a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| So the motion, this is the motion on the mail notification, notification by mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| We're going to need a roll call on this, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| Councilman Wallace is absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| So the motion, it's 4-4, the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Okay, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| That's it for you, Vice Mayor Grave, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| It's his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| I heard the statements from the hosts this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5138)|
| 1:25:46| I haven't kept it a secret that what I wished I could move through is for them to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5146)|
| 1:25:55| to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| They've been, from all accounts, good stewards of their properties, good stewards of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| neighborhood, and good stewards of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| But what I want and what I hope maybe can get through is two different things for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| I've had a lot of emails and discussions with the hosts, and it's going to devastate some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| It's going to devastate some people financially and personally in a lot of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| But at a minimum, I would like to offer up a type three amendment to the ordinance, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5186)|
| 1:26:34| if this is successful, I would like to move it to be on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| But anyway, I posted on the forum yesterday that I'd like to see if the council would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5199)|
| 1:26:47| agree a year from passage, or when it takes effect, a year for them to be able to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5207)|
| 1:26:56| future reservations that could already be on the books and let them make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| about what they're going to do with the property and the current investment that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| I understand the other side of it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| I understand why people don't want that, but I would hope that council would feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| that that's a reasonable amount of time for these folks to get their financial and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| personal lives in order and exit as they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| So I'll throw that out as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| Repeat the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| That.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| We have handouts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| The handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| It's the sunset provision, one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| What I posted on the forum yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| Grandfathering with a sunset after one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| Appreciate the use of the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| That was a great use of the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| Vice Mayor Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| You know, I'm really puzzled by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| I mean, we have 85,000 residents in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| And the one thing we asked for, knowing that the short-term rentals was going to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| the R1 and R1E, the only thing that those folks were asking for was notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| And we're not even, you know, considering the people that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| Now, all of a sudden, we have maybe, what, three or four hundred STRs in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| And we're looking and we're saying to these people, well, look, you've been doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| without a permit, but we're going to go ahead and let you go on for another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| And yet, we can't even notify or we won't even put into our ordinance the notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| of people who live next door to short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| I don't understand the inconsistency here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| And I don't understand why this council or administration are not looking at the good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| and the welfare of the neighborhoods, and especially the neighborhoods that have come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| forward and said that they have a concern about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| So, I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| This is on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| I was handed something with two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| Yeah, forget the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| Last time, there was some discussion about whether there would be a permanent provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| That is not what Vice Mayor Pavlis is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| He's recommending the option for Type 3 sunset provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| So, that last thing should just be knocked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| Charles, do you want to speak to the January 2nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| So, what's before you now is the sunset provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| It would include all qualifying properties in operation before March 1st, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| That's before you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| Council, are you still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| Councilman Delvante?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| Yeah, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Mr. Pavlis, couldn't they move into the house and then there would be a Type 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| Pull your microphone up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Move into the house and then be a Type 1 so that they could run a regular STR that's before this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| I might choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Well, and that's a choice that they have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| Yeah, I guess they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| They could sell it or they could convert it into long-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| I don't know what all the options, but that's certainly one that could be before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| But, you know, I don't run that business, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| But they have a lot of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| Give the people who are not under-occupied an opportunity to invest themselves of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5445)|
| 1:30:52| or, as you suggested, move into it or turn it into a long-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| rather than just saying on this date, you know, you can't do this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| And they've invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| They've done some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| Sure, they did this when these were not necessarily legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| but at the same time they've invested a great deal of money and efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| They've got bookings for people to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| So I would be supporting this because it does sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| It doesn't say that we're going to have non-owner-occupied forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| It's going to set a date certain when this comes to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| And I think it's one of the most fair solutions to all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5500)|

| 1:31:50| No, unless we have a shorter period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5513)|

| 1:32:01| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| The motion passes 6-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| Okay, and now to help facilitate this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5532)|
| 1:32:19| should we make it to effective January 2nd to be able to allow not to overload the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| and let the folks come in and get the necessary permit for them to be able to operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5545)|
| 1:32:33| We would appreciate it very much because we're not administratively geared up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5553)|
| 1:32:41| If somebody comes in tomorrow to get a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| they're not going to get a permit because we're not administratively geared up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| because we've just passed this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| So certainly I think it would be helpful to all of us in the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| if we made the effective date of this ordinance January 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5575)|
| 1:33:03| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| We would ask someone to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| That's a long motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| I'll make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| Okay, we have a motion and a second that the effective date of all of this would be January 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| The entire ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| The entire ordinance would become effective January 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| Vice Mayor Greene, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| On the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| On this amendment to make it effective January 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Okay, that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| So now the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| There's one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Because you have just adopted the Type 3 permit as an amendment to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| that clearly is a substantive change to what you did the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| So unless you want to come back at the next council meeting and address this on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| then if you did not wish to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| the appropriate way to deal with it would be to move to amend the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| as thrice amended now to emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| It still would not take effect until January 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| but you wouldn't have to come back next week and vote on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Even though we talked about this in the last council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| That's a little different than the MPC rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| That's the MPC rule you're thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| This is a substantive change which kicks it back to first reading unless you adopt it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5668)|
| 1:34:37| So is there a motion to adopt it on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| In that case, I would so move that we adopt it by emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| We've dealt with this for long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| I think we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| I would say that if we did postpone it for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| which I'm sure all of us would love to get more e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| but it would certainly give the public an opportunity to weigh in on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| since this is something we're just bringing up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| Have you not been looking at your e-mail inbox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| I mean, again, this is a pretty serious situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| and so what I'm saying is it would give the public time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| and it would give Mr. Wallace a chance to weigh in on it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5713)|
| 1:35:22| Actually, it was discussed last week, two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| It was discussed that we would maybe do it, but now we actually have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| We need a second on the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| I think we have a second on the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| I was just going to say this has been beat to death seven ways to Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| and there are people that disagree very strongly about what we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| but I don't think anyone's in doubt about what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| so let's just take the poison pill and go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| What are we voting on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| We're voting on the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| It will become effective January 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| but you will not have to come back and hear the sunset again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Okay, one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| So it passes seven to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| That concludes us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| One more vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| I was jumping the gun here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| Okay, so now we need to go back to the original motion as amended four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5790)|
| 1:36:37| It passes six to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Two against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Dwayne and Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| That does conclude STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| Okay, council, I'm going to ask for like a five-minute break here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| and then we'll get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Those who are waiting, I'm sorry, but we'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5821)|
| 1:37:09| Okay, thank you all for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5829)|
| 1:37:21| This is still early considering last time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5841)|
| 1:37:27| Let's grandfather everything else in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| Okay, so we are now on 9E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| 9E is an ordinance adopting the East Knox Community Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5858)|

| 1:37:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5873)|

| 1:38:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5902)|

| 1:38:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| I had some concerns raised in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| so I just wanted to give Mr. Wetzel an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| to explain what's going on with this alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| Mr. Wetzel, please state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5934)|

| 1:38:57| Good to see everybody again in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Yeah, it's a friend of a friend story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| There is a right-of-way, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| that was dedicated when the neighborhood was established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| in the early part of the last century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| There was an alley dedicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| This alley was never improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| It was never developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| The two adjacent property owners have used it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| as a driveway over the last 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| A lady that lived on one side of it passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Her son inherited the house in order to sell the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=5964)|

| 1:45:17| the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| to consider and make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| to City Council regarding the possible change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| and clarification to density calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| in the R1A low-density residential district procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| Is there any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| One thing I would like to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| just because we had the question earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| about when council asks MPC to look at something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| how does that fit in with other things that we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| So I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| does this get addressed in the recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| that we're already working on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| And I guess I would ask Gerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| and then ask you what you had in mind with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| I'd like to address this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| And I think we'll both talk about your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| This is really to resolve a discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| This is to resolve a discrepancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| between the density standards that are set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| in our normal one-year plan which governs our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| and which is a part of the overall planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| that runs out the 30-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| and the actual zone itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| It appears that from a recent application in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| and I think Ms. Malone is here to address it if she needs to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| that someone asked to increase the density on their lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| from two duplex, a duplex, two units to four units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| and that was rejected by MPC and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| And so they decided maybe that what they would rather do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| is split the lot in half and then make two duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| and it was the same four density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| And the reality is that R1 low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| is for five or under, I guess it's six really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| six residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| I don't know what just under six is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| It's got a half a person in there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| But that's what we're trying to respect here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| and it just seems like there was a disconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| It has been discussed with Gerald Green's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| and Mr. Green and the neighborhood folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| and there seems to be some general agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| but we want to give MPC a chance to take a shot on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| This is not an overall recode, do the whole system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| This is a minor fix that kind of plugs a hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| before permits get issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| because permits are being asked for all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| But Gerald may have something he wants to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Gerald Green, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| And I guess I'd start by saying, as you've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| this evening with land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| nothing is as simple or easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| And this is, as we've seen on another occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| with the zoning at the Midway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| our plans and their recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| are often not in compliance with our regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| And the plans, our policy, the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| are just that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| So in this case, the plan recommendation for the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| does not coincide with the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| permitted under the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| That has been related to the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| working on the recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| the update of the city's zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| and we'll be rectified in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| MPC will work with city staff to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| There's no, I'm not going to give you a timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| I've talked with the city law department staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| and there are some implications far beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| just the single neighborhood with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| but we'll work with them, and if appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| add it to our work program and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| Otherwise, it will be addressed as part of the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| But our goal ultimately is to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| the density restriction in low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| That's correct, and to assure that our codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| and the zoning code and the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| are compatible with the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| set forth in our policy documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| So I don't see any problem with referring to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| It may be that the timing is such that they blend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| with whatever else they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| but it's something that needs to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| or we're going to have a problem, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| Right, so you're comfortable with them figuring out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| whether it gets blended or how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| I can't control their timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| and they know best how to work through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| but I'd like to send it to them and have them cogitate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| That's good. Okay. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| Are you ready to cogitate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| Cogitate is easier than adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| We're not sure what that means exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6583)|

| 1:50:45| We've got a little gentleman down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| who has been very patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| and if you all don't mind, if we could move 11H next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| Move. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| All right, we will go ahead and review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| I think we're cutting into his new Nintendo time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| and I think that's false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| I think he's out of school tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| and I have a bad sense in ruining his holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| Okay, 11H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| to accept and express appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| to the Knoxville Firefighters Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| for the donation of 22 NordicTrack elliptical machines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| to be used by firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| as part of the fire department's exercise program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| and two portable positive ventilation fans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| which will be used for more effective removal of smoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| during structure fires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| for a total value of $27,974.93.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| Mr. Faddis, we'd like to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| I'll make it brief, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| I'll start off with echoing what the mayor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| It has, believe it or not, been a joy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| to work with you guys on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| the ones that are departing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| I'm also looking forward to the ones coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| I've met all of them, and I'm excited to get with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| But as I always state when I come up here, no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| the Knoxville Firefighters Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| is a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| And as you can see by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| we want to continue to be a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| So we thank you all for accepting this on our behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| on over 300 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| So thank you, and happy Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| Would you like to introduce your son there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| This is my son, Tristan Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Handsome young devil here, if you want to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Or you can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| Tristan actually supervises his workouts at Court South,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| and he makes sure Dad gets on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| Every now and then the mayor gets to see him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| at some of the meetings that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| He's not a stranger to community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| He's involved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| He's learning young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| Well, thank you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| Thank you for what you do as the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| of the Firefighters Association and for this donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| You're welcome to stay, Tristan, or you can go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| I'd ask for an ice cream on the way home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| The resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| if necessary, of a fee simple interest in certain property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| located at 542 Tipton Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| believed to be owned by Marilyn Martha Meese Lent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| at an estimated cost of $75,800,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| as recommended by the Abandoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Blighted, and Vacant Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| 11E is the resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| to enter into a three-year agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| with Vaughn & Melton Consulting Engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Incorporated, for the right-of-way acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| and relocation services on an as-needed basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| for an amount not to exceed $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| Councilman Delavan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| Mayor, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| It may be to Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| It may be to Dr. Lyons or David Brace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| but this is a little different than we usually do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| and it's kind of an open-ended sort of requirements contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| where we send them out wherever we need them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| for the next three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| and I guess that avoids, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| having a dozen individual resolutions approving something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| but I'm just curious what we're trying to accomplish here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| If someone would just give us a nickel's worth of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| This is actually something we've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| for the last four years or so, maybe five, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6873)|
| 1:54:38| Will you call them as needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| Yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| And, excuse me, they do...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| The on-call contract does the smaller contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| the sidewalk work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| but the big projects like Sevier Avenue streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| that gets its own right-of-way contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Those are bid separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| so that there's maybe more competition on big deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| where there might be a difference in price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| That helps me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6910)|

| 1:55:18| with HS Construction and Excavating, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6918)|

| 1:55:29| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6931)|

| 1:56:38| You can field it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=6998)|

| 1:56:45| and tweaking and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| How often will we have to upgrade the software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| just as a matter of curiosity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| You know, I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| I'd have to ask Janet, and I'll e-mail that out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| This is the upgrade from the, oh, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| It says 7.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Yeah, 7.3 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| So I'll ask Janet and send that out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| But we're still implementing Acela, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| We're trying to get it fully implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| or is it already fully implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| No, we're still in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| and there are some milestones that they still need to reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| I think if you'll notice on page 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| we are holding payment 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| until some of the issues need to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| Like any application that gets implemented, it takes time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| and so we're still working on resolving those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| Specifically, I know one issue has been an app| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| that we use in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| and so that's had some issues, and they're working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| and expect to get back to us at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| This helps you know where the trucks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| and where the work orders are and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| It's really work order management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| and it's inventory management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| So we've had a number...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| A good management tool for your central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| to execute an agreement with SSE and Associates Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| for athletic flooring services for three city recreation centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| for an amount not to exceed $69,957.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| Do you want to say something on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| I think Ms. Eli is sitting there wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| why we don't call on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| She's comfortable with you moving along on the agenda, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| I was just wondering...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| I've got to ask, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| Why does the Davidson flooring cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| three or four times more than the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| It must be much bigger or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| I don't know, but most of them...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| The other ones were like $11,000, $13,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| and that was a $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| So what are we doing, redoing the concrete work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| or something beyond the rubber floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| I mean, that's a crazy question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| but it seems more expensive for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| As far as I know, I'm Cheryl Ely, Parks and Rec Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| As far as I know of, it is just doing the rubber floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| that they have in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| So it is for the three rec centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| and that's Cumberland Estates, Cecil Webb, and E.V. Davidson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| So it will take care of all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| It is typically based on square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| I mean, some of these centers vary in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| So it's just really just covering a bigger floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7154)|

| 1:59:20| 11K is the resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| to enter into an agreement by which the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7162)|

| 1:59:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7178)|

| 2:00:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7206)|

| 2:00:33| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| I just want to thank the chief for reaching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| to Big Brothers and Big Sisters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| and fighting crime before it happens by working with kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| So that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7244)|

| 2:00:50| Yes, thank you for acknowledging that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| 12A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 1, Section 1-14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| of the Knoxville City Code relative to financial disclosures of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| This ordinance is the result of many conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| during the campaigns among the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| for the monthly reporting of financial disclosures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| as well as our retreats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| and we've talked about this at the retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| which had news media present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| What this would do is bring our city financial disclosures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| in line with state and county disclosures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| We are the only city in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| that requires monthly disclosures for candidates for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| and it seems to be fairly burdensome and cumbersome for many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| from the complaints that I've heard and received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| So this is why I have asked that we bring this forward at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7323)|
| 2:02:04| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| I think I'm certainly in favor of financial disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| so I looked into this and wanted to double-check that this was a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| and I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| Just looking at it, I pulled this from this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| which I'm going to add to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| It's the campaign financial disclosures scheduled for the 2017 election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| and there's just a lot of examples here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| Like there's a monthly disclosure that covers June 1st to June 30th due July 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| and then three days later there's a state report from April 1st to June 30th due July 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7356)|
| 2:02:43| and then there's the pre-primary report from July 1st to August 19th that's due August 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7363)|
| 2:02:51| and then there's a monthly disclosure report from July 1st to August 24th due August 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7371)|
| 2:02:59| Anyway, I could go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| I'm not sure if I lost you, but there's a huge amount of overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| I think in a way this will be better for disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| and that will be clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| People can read the reports and not be confused which one is which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7392)|
| 2:03:18| and I think there was also some enforcement issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| But anyway, I'd like to add this to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| Yes, I think this will also encourage more able, qualified people to run in the primaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7408)|
| 2:03:37| and the general election if they get that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| But this is one thing that discourages a lot of very good people that would run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7420)|
| 2:03:47| So I'm going to definitely support it, and I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| Did you want to speak again, Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| Thank you, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| One of the things that has been a—I'm in favor of financial disclosures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| I don't want to be hiding money that people are getting or not getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| But there's nothing to enforce people who don't report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| It used to be when we had a newspaper that was more interested in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7451)|
| 2:04:18| they kept a really close track on who was reporting and who was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| But there's so much to report now that that's not necessarily true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| So this would mean that there would be accountability through the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| and reporting to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| But right now, if you don't turn in one of those reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| and your name doesn't show up in the paper, nobody really knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| So I think it's important for us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| I would add, I spoke to Cliff Rogers today from the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| He is very grateful that this is before you and encourages you to pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| because also, like you said, there's no teeth in the current law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| There's no fine if you don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| We don't pay them to do the additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| They go ahead and scan it and put it on their website with the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| But frankly, in their busy schedule and trying to enforce state law in the elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| this is really burdensome to them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| And as you said, no other city in the state requires it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| So he's thankful that you all are considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| And we're saving trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| We're saving trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| Oh, there is no motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| I made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| Okay, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| Who made the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| That's on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| 12B is an ordinance to amend Chapter 4, Article 2, Division 2, Section 4-76 of Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| to create an additional category of special permits for sale in a certain area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| in the Cumberland Avenue Corridor District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 22.5, to update and modernize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| stormwater management and site development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Councilman Dallavanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| Yeah, I just want to say this looks like a very interesting ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| It is very detailed and I guess I want to ask Jim Hagerman to spend 25 minutes to explain it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7573)|
| 2:06:20| but I'm not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| I would have to call you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| Because there would be a riot in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| But hopefully there will be more study between now and the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| Jim, can you do a one minute's worth thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| We're obviously tightening up our standards, trying to keep stormwater from being contaminated by sewage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7595)|
| 2:06:42| and runoff and everything else, protecting things like sinkholes from causing problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| and raising the fees of doing all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| But tell us what we're doing and why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| Well, we're actually not tightening up standards a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| We are streamlining some processes to make it easier for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| We are making it more readable, more consistent, easier to interpret consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7622)|
| 2:07:13| And there are a couple of mechanisms that make it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| there's sort of some catch-22s built into the current process that we're trying to eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| to make it easier for the permitting process to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| And one thing we are tightening up, well, sort of tightening up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| is empowering the city to fix drainage issues on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7652)|
| 2:07:42| much as we do with, say, dirty lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| Going onto a property and mowing the grass, we can go onto a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| and pull a grocery cart out of their pipe that's backing up onto the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7670)|
| 2:07:56| that's causing the water to back up onto the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| And back charge them and lean them if you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| So you've got another tool to make sure it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| Right. Currently we do not have that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| Well, we didn't get a marked copy until just when the meeting started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| and there was no way I was going to read it again during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| But thank you for giving us that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171121?start=7700)|
