| 0:04:22| Efallai y bydd hyn yn gweithio'n fawr iawn mewn rhai sectorau o'r cymuned, ond oherwydd ein bod ni'n gweithio'n fawr iawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| mae'r un ar un yn edrych fel method gwych i ddarparu newid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| Mae'n rhaid i un ddod yn ôl i gael ymddygiad, ac yna ymddygiad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| Yna bydd y sylwadau a'r sylwadau ar un ar un yn mynd yn fawr iawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| ond mae newidiadau'n digwydd i'r rhan fawr iawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| Yn fy marn i, mae'n cymryd ymddygiadau o'r ddau i ddarparu'r cymuned cyfan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| Os bydd ein cliniwn yn mynd allan o'r Deyrnas Iechyd, byddwn yn ymwneud ag ymddygiadu i ddarparu gofal gwych i'n pobl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| Bydd cymryd ymddygiad yn golygu llesau a phrofiadau ar gyfer pob un ohonom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| ond bydd pob un ohonom yn ymwneud â'r lles o gyfleoedd i ymddygiadu yn y diwydiantau iechyd cyhoeddus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| fel ymddygiadau iechyd cyhoeddus A, Catriona, ymddygiadau hyfforddiant, a hyfforddiant ar gyfer ymddygiadau gwych.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| Fel cliniwn, rydyn ni wedi bod yn ddiddorol a chyfrifol yn yr holl amgylcheddau'r Deyrnas Iechyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| Rydyn ni'n credu y byddwch chi'n gwneud y penderfyniad sy'n well i'n pobl mewn y ddinas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| ond gadewch i'r ymddygiad a'r ddiddorol o'r staff fod yn ymddygiadau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| Rydyn ni'n gobeithio'ch penderfyniad a'n ymddygiad i ddigwydd i gynllunio'r ymddygiad cyhoeddus ar gyfer ein plentynau rydyn ni wedi'u darparu ar gyfer y 17 mlynedd diwethaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:46| Diolch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Brif Weinidog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| Iawn, dwi eisiau gwneud ymddygiad, nid yw'n unig yn cael ei ysgrifennu gan eich pobl mewn ymddygiadau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| mae'n cael ei ysgrifennu gan y cymuned meddygol yma yn Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Felly, rydw i wedi ymddygiad â llawer o'r ymddygiadwyr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| Rwy'n gwybod bod y pobl hwn, nid yw'n boblogaeth hawdd, yn enwedig gyda'r ymddygiadau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| i'w ymddygiad, ac yn gwybod bod yna sefyllfaoedd cymdeithasol sy'n ymwneud â'ch hyfforddiant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| sy'n effeithio ar y iechyd llawer o'r plant hynny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| Felly, mae gennych amrywiaeth o ysgrifennu o'r cymuned meddygol yma hefyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Rydyn ni'n clywed llawer am, neu rydyn ni wedi clywed heddiw am beth yw'r ymddygiad i'w wneud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| Beth, yn eich meddwl, oherwydd eich bod chi wedi bod yno'n hir, beth yw'r cymdeithas i'r hyn rydyn ni'n ei wneud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| Rwy'n deall mai'n anodd cael rhywun i ddod i mewn fel ymddygiadwyr cyntaf i weithio yno,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:42| ond, oherwydd eich bod chi wedi bod yno'n hir, beth yw'ch asesiad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| neu beth fyddai cymdeithasau eraill na'r hyn sy'n cael ei ymddygiadu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| Wel, dydyn nhw ddim yn meddwl eu bod nhw'n adroddiadu ar unrhyw un i ddod i mewn fel ymddygiadwyr ar hyn o bryd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| Rydyn ni wedi adroddiadu ar hyn o bryd pan oedd ymddygiadwyr cynnig wedi mynd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| Rwyf wedi siarad â rhai ymddygiadwyr yn y ddinas sydd mewn gwirionedd yn ddiddorol o ran y sefyllfa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| Felly, rwy'n credu y gallwn ni ymddygiadu hynny os y gallwn ni fod yn y Deyrnas Iechyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| Rwy'n credu y gallai rhai ffyrdd, o ran cael ymddygiadau newydd o'r Deyrnas Iechyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| gan adroddiadu ymddygiadau, ac rwy'n gwybod eich bod chi'n ymwybodol o hynny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| Un o'r pethau eraill sy'n gwneud yn anodd i ni wneud arian fel ymddygiadwyr cynnig,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| nid yw'r lab a'r x-ray yn ein ymddygiadwyr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| Dydyn ni ddim yn adroddio am hynny ein hunain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Ac yn ymddygiadwyr cynnig, mae hynny'n broblemau'n eithaf fawr,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| gwneud ymddygiadwyr cynnig, ymddygiadwyr cynnig, ymddygiadwyr cynnig a phethau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Rydyn ni'n eu gwneud ar llawer o adroddiadau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Felly, nid ydyn ni'n cael y cyfle i wneud cymaint o arian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| fel yr ofis sy'n gallu ei adeiladu ar hynny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| Ie, rwy'n gwybod, mae'n edrych i mi fel y byddai'n anodd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| i ddoctor arall i ddod yno.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Dwi'n gwneud yr adroddiad, nid unrhyw beth mwy, i ddod yno,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| oherwydd mae'r Deyrnas Iechyd yn ymddygiadwyr,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| oherwydd nad ydyn nhw'n cael y gallu i ddod â'r adroddiadau gwledig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| Rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, mae hynny'n beth cymhleth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Roedd cwestiynau wedi'u gofyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Roedd Comisiynydd Andrews wedi gofyn rhai cwestiynau am hynny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| Rydych chi'n gwybod, mewn busnes ysbytai,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| rydyn ni'n cael yr hyn rydyn ni'n ei ddweud yw'r ysbytai sy'n canolbwyntio cyffredin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| yn ysbytai lle maen nhw'n cael eu pwyntio mewn ffordd ychydig fwy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| yna, maen nhw'n gwneud yr un peth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Mewn gwirionedd, maen nhw'n gobeithio eu rhoi gwasanaethau fwyaf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| ond maen nhw'n debygol o ysbytai dynol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Mae'r ysbytai dynol yn cael eu pwyntio yn fwy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| ar eu pwyntiau Medicare a Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| na'r ysbytai dynol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| Ac yna, maen nhw'n cael y peth ddiddorol hwnnw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| sy'n cael ei ddweud o'r ysbytai gwaith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Ac os oeddech chi'n cael eich bil yr un peth sy'n cael ei ddweud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| chi'n gwybod, er enghraifft, ym Mhrifysgol Nocs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| rydyn ni'n cael ein pwyntio fel 0.79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Un yw'r hawliau dynol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Rydyn ni'n cael ein pwyntio 0.79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Os allwn ni fynd i lawr mewn bil yng Nghymru,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| sy'n 0.83,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| byddwn ni'n cael ein pwyntio llawer mwy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Ac yn ceisio darganfod y system hwn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| dwi'n dweud, mae'n system gwirioneddol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| ond mae'n rhywbeth rydyn ni'n cael ei ddeall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Fodd bynnag, diolch iawn am dod i mewn a siarad â ni,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| a diolch eich bod chi'n gwneud hynny i'r plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| Diolch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Os allwn i wneud ychydig o adroddiadau ar y 90 diwrnod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| fel y gwnais i ddeall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| y cyfrifiad yng Nghymru o'r 90 diwrnod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| oedd ein bod ni'n cyfrifiad i fod yn gweithio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| ar yr un ffordd o gyflwyno ar gyfer 90 diwrnod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| Ac, rydych chi'n gwybod, dim bynnag hynny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Ychydig o wahaniaethau sydd wedi ei ddweud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| mae Dr Buchanan wedi siarad am ein bod ni'n mynd a phethau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| Ar hyn o bryd, mae rhai ohonoch ni| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| â 33 a 34 diwrnod o ddod â'r cyfrifiad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| a'r cyfrifiad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Mae'r PTO, mae'r max y maen nhw'n ei roi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| yn ogystal â 5 mlynedd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Fel y gwnais i ddeall, y papur y maen nhw'n ei roi i ni| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| ar hyn o bryd, os oes gen i wybodaeth cywir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| maen nhw'n cydnabod yn ogystal â 5 mlynedd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| ac mae gennych 25 diwrnod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Mae ganddyn nhw hefyd ddau diwrnod fawr,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| felly mae'n golygu bod y Deyrnas Gyhoeddus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| yn cael ei ddewis am ddau dydd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| ac nid wyf yn gwybod sut i ymddangos â hynny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| sut y byddwn ni'n ymddangos â hynny erioed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| Nid wyf yn gwybod os mae'n rhaid i ni| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| ddod o'r dydd a ddefnyddio un o'n 25 diwrnod PTO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| neu dim ond diwrnod heb ddod o'r dydd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| neu mynd i weithio lleo mewn clinic gwahanol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=613)|

| 0:11:01| Mr. Smith, you want to elaborate on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| No, there's nobody here from Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Joe, anything you want to add to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Pretty self-explanatory with what's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| I would like to have Francis be at Monday's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| to answer some questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| I don't want us to tie our hands in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| I have some big concerns about how we're treating our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:44| I know that the majority, I think, of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| disagreed with the severance packages that were offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| My feeling is that we got a really big knee-jerk reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| to something that Mayor Ragsdale did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| because of previous financial missteps that Mayor Ragsdale took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| and that what was going on was more of a reaction to Mayor Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| than it was to these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| I think that if we're going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| And this is the same issue that we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| with the health department about if Cherokee takes over this clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| are they going to treat these county employees fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| when they become Cherokee employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| And I think that we would all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| we want the best and the brightest working for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| and running our government, and we're not going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| And it's the same with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| We're not going to get the best and the brightest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| unless we compensate them competitively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| with private sector businesses, and the same with their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| Now, I know that in most businesses the size of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| if someone is leaving not because they're being fired for a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| but if they're being laid off or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| a severance package is not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Now, I would object to the golden parachutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| that we see these CEOs getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| but I think a three-month severance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| for someone who has worked for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| for as long as some of these people have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| and especially when you look at their age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| and the shape of the job market today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| a three-month severance is not at all out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| And I think we need to separate our feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| for things that Mayor Ragsdale did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| from doing the right thing for our county's employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| And I personally think that those severance packages were not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:17| It was basically three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| That's what you would probably get at a private firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| These people didn't resign because they wanted to stop working for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Anybody who was paying attention knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| that they were not welcome in the new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| And I think they were given the option of resigning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| which looks better on your resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| or if they stuck around, being fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| And I think that we are treating these employees poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| And I'm a firm believer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| and we've got to be competitive with the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| if we're going to attract the best and the brightest to work for the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| and I think that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| So I hope that we will think long and hard about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| and not tie human resources' hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| when it comes to how we compensate our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| I did have a question or two for Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| When he gave us the opinion that there wasn't anything in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| that allows this action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| is there anything within our charter that says specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| that a severance package cannot be given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Your charter is silent, as is your code, as is your employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| But substantive case law that I researched led me to the conclusion that it's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| And I'm in agreement with Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| The people that these three people were put in a very bad position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| technically they resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| In effect, they were fired, and we all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| So what were they to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| And this is within the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| The money was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| It's his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| I think the mayor, we should operate this government, as Amy said, like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| In the private sector, you want to be able to fire some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| and make that fall a little bit softer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| And I think that's an appropriate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| So I'm very sorry for the way this has worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| I feel for those individuals, and I think they've suffered unduly for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| So I just think it was inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| It was in very bad form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And I hope we don't repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Tony, that's pretty much cut to the chase as to I'm in agreement with you with what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| Law director or even Mr. Chairman, how many employees do we have in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| We've got, what, 1,000 in the sheriff's department, and how many, 2,500 school teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| and we've got 4,000 or 5,000 employees that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| What I'm concerned with is that, you know, people quit every day here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| People get hired every day in Knox County to fill in some of those vacant spots and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Other people did not get any severance packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| They just came up and, you know, these individuals got severance packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| But the other persons that get out there and work hard every day and all of a sudden they up and quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| I mean, what scared me is when we saw this and it came out in the paper that you're going to have these people doing this on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| Francis is going to be lined up with people on Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| People say, hey, I want to quit so I can get three months of salary or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| But keep in mind these individuals, they brought stuff with them when they did resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| They've got all their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| They did not lose any of that time that they had built up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| I just, we need to set this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Yeah, I just want to make a comment about that because there's a big difference when people come up and say I quit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| and when they get together with the mayor and I don't know who else were there at the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| and they said, you know, you have an option here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| This is the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| And we're going to make a deal with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| If you'll go ahead and resign, then you're giving up your ability to go on unemployment insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| You're giving up a lot of benefits to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| But in exchange, this is what I'll do for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| And then they live up to their agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| They resign and then the county reneges on theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Now, I don't know what happened to those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Maybe we need to bring the parties that were involved with it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| There was nothing written, but maybe it was a gentleman's agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| and it was a lack of foresight on the people thinking that they could believe what the county was telling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| But I think everyone here knows that those people were going to be fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| And they sat down and they, you know, they made a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| And what happened is that after it was all over and they resigned is that the county didn't live up to their end of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| And I don't think there's anyone here who believes that that wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| I also would like to make that there's a big difference between somebody who just comes in and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| I quit, and someone who is forced out for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| And if somebody quits, then they aren't entitled to a severance and they aren't entitled to unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| I mean, these people, because they did agree to resign, they're not getting their severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| They're not even eligible for unemployment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| If they had stayed on and let the new mayor fire them, they could have gotten unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| So not only have we taken back the money that was promised them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| we've also put them in a bad situation in terms of trying to apply for unemployment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| They're not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| I think we have really put the screws to these people and the county has treated them badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| And I personally am embarrassed about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| And I agree, Larry, we don't want anybody who's, I mean, people who quit just to quit, they aren't eligible for severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| They wouldn't be eligible for severance in the private sector either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| And not everybody who works for the county is going to be eligible for severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| These were department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| It's just, it's a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| And I'm embarrassed by what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| I think that the county has treated these three people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| one of these people has worked for the county for almost 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| And this is how we treat him on his way out the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| I mean, I hope I'm not the only one up here who's ashamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| I think there's a distinct difference between a county employee and someone who's a director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| When you're a director, when you accept a cabinet-type position, you serve at the will of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| And although I don't agree and I think it was unfortunate that those three people were a victim of that circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:46| when you become a director, you serve at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| And if you're going to be fired on Friday versus Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| but I think a blanket policy is just because you're a director doesn't mean you're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| like you talked about a CEO, they're not obligated to a golden parachute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| And because you're a director doesn't mean that you should get something more than a general employee gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| And so I think it's very, very critical to understand that although I hate that three people are out of a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| they took a director's position under a term-limited mayor knowing that it's a director's position with no guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| And I hate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| I hate that their name was put in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| I hate that they were a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| But when you accept a cabinet position, you serve at the will of that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| And just because you took a director's position versus somebody that we paid to do a minimal job here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:42| and you shouldn't be treated any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| The big difference is it would be just like if you were promised a retirement when you got ready to retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| and you say, okay, at 30 years we're going to give you a retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| and then you retire at 30 years and just like you were promised, you're not given it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| They signed that agreement to resign with the understanding they were going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| They gave up their benefits to go on unemployment because there was an agreement there to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| And I think a CEO that already has in his contract or whatever is when you're terminated, you're going to get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| Then he gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| And I think that's what the critical difference is, is that I think they were promised something and then the county reneged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| I think what we're doing now, though, is taking away the ability to make that promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| I think that's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| No, I think what we're doing is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| But I think when you do something, you have to know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| I think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| But I'm saying what happened to them, that absolutely the new mayor had the right to get who he wants to work for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| Absolutely they had the right to get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| But what happened, they were brought there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| My understanding is they were brought there and they said, if you'll go ahead and resign, we'll give you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| They resigned and then the county didn't live up to their end of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| I'd like to ask Commissioner Shouse if he would explain a little bit about the city's drop program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:17| Because one thing we have to keep in mind when we pass these blanket-type ordinances is I know we like to compare a director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:31| to any school teacher or any public works person or any sheriff's deputy, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| You want your directors, I mean, in my opinion, we want our directors to be among the best and the brightest out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:51| We want that for everyone, but a director has to come with a pedigree, a resume, a life's work before they get to that director slot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1491)|
| 0:25:01| So I know the city has a program, and I hate to put you on the spot, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| It's been a few years, but as I understand the drop program, you decide, so you're a police officer and you make $50,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:18| and it's September the 20th, 2010, you decide, I want to retire September the 20th, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| Your salary stays the same, but if you know how actuarially these pensions work, they're based on your last year's, your highest salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:34| And so you no longer accrue benefits in the pension plan, but I believe that the city's contribution to the pension plan goes into the drop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:43| which is designated retirement option plan, I think, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| And so you no longer are accruing pension benefits for two years, but when you do leave September the 20th, 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:57| you have a lot of money there as you leave and you walk out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| Then you get your pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| At that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| At that earlier rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| That last two years is when these guys, that rule of 80 and all that comes in and you hear this phrase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| I'm working for nothing this last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| I would have made more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| But that's a nice program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| It's a nice incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| So I guess what I'm saying, I'm not against doing this, but again, putting an umbrella on that without an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| and I think that's a nice program that the city folks, you know, take advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| And if we take away this ability, because I don't like how this was done, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| I'm sure that the three of them probably have regretted making that haste decision that they were approached with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:53| and say, well, have Mayor Burchett fire me on Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| But if we put this in here with nothing, I think we'll end up not being able to recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:10| And it is a recruiting job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Mayor Burchett is out there recruiting the best and the brightest that he can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Hopefully he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Hopefully that's what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| He's not just hiring anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| So I think we need to give some options, because people do leave their careers for what is potentially a four-year job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| eight years at the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| So if you find a mid-career person, you know, you're going to have to give that person something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| because we're not the highest paying folks out there, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| I know folks may be surprised by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Some people may actually take a cut to come here or may get a level salary to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| So with, you know, benefits being what they are, the future looking as bleak as it is in terms of cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| So I guess what I'm saying, we have to leave some options out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| I'm not saying put everyone in there, but in terms of how we negotiate with our directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| I think we need to leave some flexibility in putting this blanket out here, no severance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| which I'm okay with, without saying putting some other things in the policies I'd have issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| So I guess I'm like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| I wish Ms. Fogarty would show up on Monday with, you know, some options for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| So she's more aware of what, you know, HR programs do in other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| So it would be good for her to show up and talk with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Mr. Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| I would just add the drop program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Obviously, it's very popular among employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| It's not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| And I don't know that it would work with people who serve at the pleasure of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| You know, the city has civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| We have sheriff's merit and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| But the city having civil service, you know, is almost a job guarantee virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| So knowing that somebody can lay you off next or say your job is being eliminated next week might not work with drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| And the other thing that I just wanted to comment on Dr. Briggs' statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| if someone is a pension that's been promised, you know, the federal law backs that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| So that can't just be changed at the whim of a political officeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| That's what you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Mr. Burles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Yes, I'd like to ask our law director if the commission has the ability to reinstate those pensions for those three people or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:38| You mean the severances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| I'm sorry, the severances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| Well, Commissioner, my research indicates that, first of all, you're dealing with at-will employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| And even though people are presuming, I don't really know what the facts were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| This is what happens when these kind of deals are cut and the law director is never told until I have to read it on my BlackBerry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| while I'm visiting my dad in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| So if there's any kind of caution or learning curve, it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| And a lot of people are talking about this in the abstract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| I gave this a pure legal analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Becky Weitrich, Bruce Weitrich's wife, works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| I had to go tell my own employee, sorry, I don't think the law supports this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| I think you could put yourselves in jeopardy by paying this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| I think there's a possibility of someone filing an ouster suit for you giving them this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| Regardless if it was done in the past, it doesn't matter how many wrongs make a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| I gave it a legal analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| And if it would have fallen the other way, I would have taken the hit, whatever that would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| But that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| You have a situation where you have, I don't know what was promised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| but the mayor isn't empowered to abrogate the charter or the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| For instance, in the code section as well that talks about employment at will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| it says none of the county's policies may be construed to create a contract of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| or any other legal obligation expressed or implied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| I think this thing stinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| It's wretched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| And there's no good thing about the way it unfolded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| And these people have been put in a terrible situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| And if I take at face value the rumors I've heard about that they were basically told do this and you'll get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| But, again, you can see the cumulative abusive effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Now you have a woman who goes to her supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| She goes, you've been sexually harassing me for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I'll see you in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| He goes, wait a minute, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Why don't you resign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| I'll get you six months severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Sign a confidentiality agreement or just whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Again, these things, we're not the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| We're government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| You're taking public money and you're paying people for work they didn't perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| I don't mean they haven't performed over the years, but now prospectively you're saying after you've stopped actually physically working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| here's three more months severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| This should have never occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| What should have occurred is I should have gotten a call and said I'm about to offer these people a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| And I would have told them, are you out of your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| I mean, quite frankly, colloquially speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Yeah, I mean, could they sue and could a judge say, too bad it's so said, law director's wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| I'm going to evoke an oral contract and enforce it and pay them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| Of course they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| I think you'd put yourselves in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| That's my biggest concern is I have to look at this, again, without personal passions and prejudices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| I would have loved to have been a hero to my office and to my employee who's been long-term and say, don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| You guys can breathe easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| You're getting three months' pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Tell Bruce to take it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| I couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| I don't think the law supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| The only time the courts have supported severance packages of this ilk is when there's a written contract and it's codified in a code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| None of those apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| And I realize, I mean, I'm not an automaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| I realize how heart-wrenching it is for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| This is a tough economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| I didn't want to be the guy to say, sorry, you should have trusted whoever you dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| But it's a terrible situation, and I wish the law was easier that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| After I finished my research, I conferred with colleagues across the state, and I said, tell me about your severance package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| They just started laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| They said, you guys give severance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I mean, it's almost endemic in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| You don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| And, again, it's an unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| I'm concerned about you being accused of ultra-violence, in other words, exceeding your authority and defending 11 ouster suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:29| But, again, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| I'm not the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| I'm just giving you what I think the law reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| You want to make a motion and pay these people, you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| And, you know, maybe the attorneys out there who make a living and have made suing the county a cottage industry, maybe they'll do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:47| Maybe we'll be in court for the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I hope that, because this is something I hear a lot from men in government, is that we need to run our government more like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2030)|
| 0:34:00| And you're saying government is government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| It's not business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Government can be run like a business, but we also have certain protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| For instance, if my computer breaks, I can't call my cousin Ronnie and go, Ronnie, give me a new computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| Don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| We have purchasing procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| We have codes to protect the money to which you're entrusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| And, you know, you can, if you're going to try to have a policy like this, if it's codified, then it may be defensible, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:28| There is, everything we have doesn't give, you can't imply that that was ever the intent of the crafters of your home rule charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:38| There are certain business applications that work well with government, but others, clearly we can't, because we are keepers of the public coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| That's why we have purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Look at all the massacres you went through just to get rid of surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| You think you just go to the courthouse and bid it out and get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Instead, you go through all these safeguards, checks, and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| So I've been hearing that scenario for 20 years, run government like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| When I was in grad school in the 80s, no one was able to come pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Well, you wrote a really good paper about that recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| Well, I mean, that's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| I would have loved to just, you know, said, but again, and that's one of the things I discussed with the new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| I said, you know, you have a law director down the hall, and maybe now it's time to start utilizing that resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| In other words, as he came on board, start utilizing, you've got a team of lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| So these things shouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| We shouldn't be bumbling and stumbling through these kind of machinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| Well, is there legally anything that we can do for these three employees who have been treated so unfairly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:44| and we all agree have been treated badly in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| Monetarily, I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| I truly don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| I don't think the law would support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| And again, that's why there's repeated references to at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| You serve at the pleasure, and you have no recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| And unemployment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| They can apply for unemployment compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Since they resign, they're not eligible, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Well, I would suspicion they would reject it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| Item 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| Resolution R-10-9-903 is extending the billboard moratorium for an additional six months expiring March 31, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:31| Mr. Law Director, this came from your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| Number 33?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Yes, sir, that was a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| I don't recall which commissioner requested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| But I believe it was through MPC to continue because this ongoing litigation hasn't been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| And as a result, until such time as it's fleshed out, it gives us at least some modicum of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| That was originally mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| I think we've done it several times, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Reading the fine print of the attachment to the whatever you want to call it, the expiration date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:12| is it going to be March 31 or is it going to be September 30, 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:20| Something just needs to be tuned up in the fine print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| Is it going to be March 31 or March 30 or September 30, 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:36| Because there's a conflict within the writing of on way off down in the paperwork somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| I'll fix that and I'll take responsibility for it, whatever it may be, and we'll get you a definitive date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| Do we want to put this on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| If it's just until March 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| That's six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| That's six months, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| I believe that you'll find that in the paragraph in the document it says September 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Well, I should get my money back for that hooked on phonics course I took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| But I'll get you a definitive answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Obviously, Scrivener's error, we'll fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| On consent, if you need to, you can always pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Mr. Chairman, when you get through that, I need to jump back to number 32 when you're through with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| We're done with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Okay, number 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Yeah, do we need, since we'll be doing the appointment in September for District 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| do we need to pull District 7 out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| This is Ordinance O-10-9-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| It's amending Chapter 2, Article 10, Division 2 of the Knox County Code entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| Base Personnel Policies by adding a new section 2-774 to preclude Knox County from remitting severance payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| to county employees for work not performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| This amends Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 10, Division 2, establishing Section 2-774 previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| Do we need both of these, Mr. Law Director, a resolution and an ordinance or just an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Well, sir, the county mayor is responsible for promulgating the employee handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| so he'd have to agree to change the county handbook, whereas the Knox County Code, not the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| but the code codifies your personnel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| That's why you'll need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| There's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| One's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| Any questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| I don't think we can put an ordinance on consent, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Item 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| This is Ordinance O-10-9-102, amending Article 4 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| to add a new Section 4.103 regarding standards and requirements for flea markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Buzz, do you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Buzz Johnson, MPC staff, City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| I believe this was a request of Commissioner Anders specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| You all, I believe, passed a resolution asking MPC to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| We looked at other communities, see how they dealt with flea markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| Certainly one could argue that allowed to develop with at least minimum requirements could result in problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:41| and I think that's what had been recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| We looked at what other communities have done and how they have addressed those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| and hopefully came up with some good minimum criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| You should have a copy of the report there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| We'll have a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Well, we do have a definition of a flea market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| They're already listed as permitted uses in three commercial zones, but we had no standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| So on the page where we include standards for flea markets, Section 4.103,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2470)|
| 0:41:18| you see various things there that hopefully will provide some proper guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| where there can be some sense of control for these kinds of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| Obviously in this day and time, people try to look for ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| legitimate ways to make a little extra money, and certainly that can't be faulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| But the way these things can proliferate and they develop can present some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| So hopefully we've outlined some, as I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| minimum criteria that can help control those particular uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| And I'd be glad to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Between now and the next commission or the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| I need to know an example of where you visited that you came up with these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Mark Donaldson actually, I think, did most of the research, so he'll be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| and he'll be glad to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| I need to go visit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Which locations are these guidelines being developed to try to control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| Well, we looked at primarily other cities and counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| I don't have those specific names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| We just generally mention that in the report, but we'll get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| You're talking about the intent of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| There's a couple of places in my district on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| On Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| You want a specific location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| There's a location on Clinton Highway that I get several calls a month on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| It was a car wash and laundromat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| It's been abandoned for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| They've since opened the stalls of the car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| They've brought in storage trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| They've opened the laundromat and stored mattresses, baby furniture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| tear it down and put it back every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| But they've got people parking on the right-of-way of Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| And so it's kind of developed into dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| And also the building is probably in violation of code for housing people in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| without any fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| There's no business license and things like that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Where I'm coming from is that a lot of times I look at land use issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:39| being what I would like for you to do with your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| So I need to make sure that we try to steer away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| This is more of a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| And also, I mean, it's blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| I mean, it's part of Clinton Highway that's recently lost a few businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| It's blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| But it's mainly a safety concern on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| But there again, all the things that we're talking about right at the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| are things that are already probably in code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| I've tried to address it through code with Grant Rosenberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| and this is where this came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Parking on the right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Or being a traffic hazard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| Well, but you'd have to have, well, also fire hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| And, I mean, there's multiple problems out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| It's not just a matter of you'd have to have a sheriff's deputy out there the whole time they're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| And, I mean, it's people that just north of Emory Road, there's a location up there that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| several people have built nice homes there, and they don't want to have multiple traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| The traffic that it brings, and it's ungoverned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| and it's not good policy to let something like that blight your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2692)|
| 0:45:00| I'd say this is an attempt to, if I could further add to that answer, I think it's an attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| The uses that you have now that are listed as permitted uses in the commercial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| they are subject to minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| This is a case, I think, where we have a use that has been conducted in some of these commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| that is not subject to minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| And I think that's, as Commissioner Anders says, there are safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| There are also practical issues about how much parking they require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| They may be taking parking that was legitimately installed for the use that comes under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:41| or is subject to the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| So I think there's some not only safety issues but practical issues that we're trying to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| And I understand all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| But when I read the fine print again, what size location would this be, the car wash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:59| if it were practical to run a whatever this operation is going to be called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| Well, what you currently have is four stalls for a car wash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| a laundromat that may be 5,000 square feet maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| They bring all the product almost to the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| And so there is no parking in their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| And, you know, that's the part of Clinton Highway that we could really use some redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2782)|
| 0:46:31| but nobody's going to drive down through there and locate a business there if it looks like that, if it's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| There's multiple car wrecks just a block away at West Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| You know, if I could fix that part of Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| And also it's not fair for one store to operate as a secondhand store under regulations of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| and this guy gets to do whatever he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Right. And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| And so I think it's level in the playing field for somebody that's operating a legitimate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| And then I get back to my opening sentence, what I would like to happen for your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| This proposal says that plea markets are going to be five acres in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| so effectively this location is put out of business, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| I don't know what acreage they have, but I think that if you want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| to set up on the roadside with multiple vendors and have a secondhand store should be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:38| You should not be able to operate without a business license when somebody else has to have a business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| You shouldn't have to operate outside of code when everybody else has to follow code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| and you shouldn't snub your nose at safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| All this is going is to make sure that if you want to have a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| that it needs to be legitimate, it needs to be safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| and it needs to be done in accord where everybody else has to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| And the rules on this would be that you have five acre lot, that you can only be open three days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| That you have to have a business license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| although most of the time when I see flea market operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| I think I envision people that are only taking this booth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| and trying to move something so they can maybe pay a utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| No, this guy is here every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| I mean, he's here six days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| And that's the reason that I need to see or eyeball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| And we can change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| I mean, this is just the first reading, first draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| I would prefer not to read it the first time and then really ball it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| and then have it a first reading again a month later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| We have the same regulations on yard sales in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| They can only do so many a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| So we're doing the same thing to homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| And that's what I want to make sure that we get the problem fixed that we perceive to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| And some of these people that maybe need to be in some kind of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| because we are going to get vendor license off of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| One of the things that needs to be done in the United States is we need a little bit more cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| So I just want to make sure we do, that we're addressing the right things for the right reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| That's the only reason I ask these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| that I wanted to know where this location was that we're trying to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| It's Clinton Highway north of West Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| It's near Travis Meats, if you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| Brad, that's the place where we did that condemnation of that, was it an Ingalls store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| Directly next door to the Ingalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| He's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| There are three, at least three, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| There are at least three pages of line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| And I was going to ask the question about one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| It's the third page that was presented online to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| Something about around a half million dollars to City County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| Yeah, what we're trying to accomplish with that is that we put it in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| To start with, it's City County renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| This is the normal maintenance, annual building maintenance items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| just to try to keep our properties maintained as well as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| the ones that are under our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| And what we're trying to do with this line item transfer is just spell it out in a little bit more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| so that you can see more clearly where that money is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| Okay, so what did we forego in the from line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| The from account, what did we not do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Well, what we're doing is we've had a number of discussions with PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| about what the highest priority items were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| And this line item transfer would accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| And there's always a number of things that would be nice to do that we're not doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| And so we kept this for this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| We've kept it at the absolute here's the things that you have to do this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I think there were like four numbers in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| My laptop's lost its charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| I think there were like four lines to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| The from line total was $1,033,103.79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:45| You have a tremendous memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| And the to line where it went to actually matched that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| So I'm complimenting you on getting the addition correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| The thing that I'm raising the question about, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| is that if I was not speaking right at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| this would be passed by voice vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| and it's the equivalent of half the cost of the renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| that was proposed at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| And we've talked about Carter Elementary School for months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| I just want commissioners to remember how easy it is to talk about a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| and how difficult it is to talk about $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| And I would move that the line item transfers be approved at our upcoming meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| Mr. Law Director, can we put these on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| I don't think we can put them on a consent for next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| The line items had always been handled at the finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| Maybe we need to make sure that that then is just handled at the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| We'll put them on a consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Let me also mention that there was $4,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| We had had a question with the county clerk's office as to who paid for the beer notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| What we've agreed to do is that it's going to come out of the beer fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| the money that's been collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| And so this is a line item transfer basically from the court clerk to $4,800 right for the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| Item number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| So the original list had three, and this is the fourth one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| So that takes care of any issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| I just wanted to tell John how delighted I am that he's still with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| It's good to see him here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| I just had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| There were two things that I thought were going to be on the agenda this month that weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| One was that Carter School question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| Has that been put off another month or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Well, the superintendent was here to talk about it at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| I don't know where we've got to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| I think the school, we asked the school board to revisit the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| And to revisit it with the new school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| So the new school board is not met yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| And the second question is that problem eighth district again, you know, deals with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| It's all the way halfway to Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Yeah, it's halfway to Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| But I thought also this month was going to be the month we were going to look at the midway issue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| Has that been delayed because, you know, that came up a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| and we were going to wait until after the first of September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| We had asked the mayor to look at that, as I recall, and to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| I don't think he's had an opportunity to do that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| At least get some of his input into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Oh, it is on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Oh, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| It's on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| So it will be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| One thing that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Oh, go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Chiles had asked for some information on our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| And I do have that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| And I can pass that out here at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Or I can just make that available to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| Can you just e-mail it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| I most certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| One item that we did not discuss was ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| We have to appoint two people to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| The process, a suggestion would be that we say that we have two vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| people who are interested send resumes to the commission office, and we can make that appointment in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| We would have to go through a public hearing type process, if that is agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| Do we want to at some point, we've talked about this before, re-look at the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| I think we should look at the policy and the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| Mike, does one of those have to be a commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| Are you coming off the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| No, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| I think mine was a three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Yeah, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| I mean, is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| If so, we'll go ahead and put out a notice that we're accepting resumes for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| and people will be interested in the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| I think we need to set the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| so I'd like to make a motion that all the items that were discussed be on consent for the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Would you like for her to read them all off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| She's got them, so I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| She can send them and we can pull them if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part2?start=3356)|
