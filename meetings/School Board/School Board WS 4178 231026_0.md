| 0:01:21| And thank you to everyone who is in attendance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| I just want to remind you that this is the Board's public business meeting to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=83)|
| 0:01:29| items that come before us for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| So we would just ask that you be respectful and courteous at all times and please be mindful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| that the sound does carry pretty easily in this room, so if you need to speak to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| neighbor or take a phone call, please just step out of the room to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Are there any requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| Okay, motion by Ms. Horne, second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| So we will move on to the Superintendent's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| I want to take a moment and provide some brief updates about one of our most important projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| the 865 Academy's initiative to transform our high school experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| As we move into the second quarter, I want to highlight some goals of this initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| during the remainder of the school year and share some exciting news about the Academy's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| So one of the factors that really drew us into this initiative was the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| provide transformation for our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| We believe that strong connections between the classroom and the workplace will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| students identify their path forward after graduation, whether that means enrolling in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| college or a trade school, enlisting in service to our country, or finding high-wage employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| We also believe that this approach has benefits for our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| When students have a clear pathway of success after graduation, it creates a vibrant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| dynamic workforce that drives innovation, fosters economic growth, and cultivates a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| sense of purpose and fulfillment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Currently, we have two big areas of focus as we're working on our 865 for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| Every year there's a little bit more as this builds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| And this year, our real focus is partnerships and also for us to start looking at our counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| and how we work on our practices in that area too so that every kid gets those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| So it's been great as we've seen a lot of excitement in our community, really work around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| partnerships in our business community to be excited about that, teachers to have experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| outside of the school to see what local businesses are looking at, and also for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| to have those experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| I know we're tracking those through the first quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| If it's from guest speakers, I know I was talking to a principal today, and he was talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| about Tombris, the marketing company, had come to talk to their kids, and he was thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| about his personal kids and saying, I wish my kids had exposure to that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| when it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| So we've been really embraced by our local business community for that, and we're grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Dr. Wilson and I recently attended a conference in Wisconsin last week that was focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| the academies, and one of our biggest takeaways was the importance of those close working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| relationships between business partners and high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| And so I would say what we saw there in districts that have been doing this for 10-plus years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| was that they talked a lot about it outliving even the lives of superintendents, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| It became so ingrained in the business community that lots of times when they did hire additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| or future superintendents, that the business community asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Keep this alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Keep this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| And how that just brought a lot of lifeblood to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| So it's very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| If you are a business partner out there hearing this, and you'd like to, we're very thankful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| for all the organizations that are working with our schools and working through their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| academy coaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| But if you would like to be part of that in your organization, then please visit knoxschools.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| slash academies and fill out that interest form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| We have a system where that then will take you to a process working with Knox Ed Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| with us to plug you into the right school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| The second thing, as I mentioned before, that we're learning is the reality of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| that has to be done differently to achieve our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Our high schools are blessed with amazing teachers, counselors, and leaders who do tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| work every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| The opportunity ahead of us now is to begin to identify how this model will require new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| ways of thinking and engaging our students to create long-term change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| So preparing our students for life after graduation and helping them to identify a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| path to success after high school requires us to be very organized in every aspect of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| I'm thankful for the enthusiasm and energy that our schools have already applied to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| transformation and look forward to fruitful conversations of how we can continue to target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| these efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Finally, I'm very pleased to welcome a talented educator and leader to this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| I don't believe he's with us today because he's still in the middle of transitioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| But it became evident through our ongoing work for the 865 academies and as we worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| with the districts that had this that we needed a practitioner who could help implement these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| things on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| If you think about our structure, Shannon Jackson is over our college and career readiness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| department, which means that she's working on everything from CTE to counseling to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| 865 work that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| So we were able to actually, we had a position that was in our federal dollars, as I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| I shared with you all in the update, that we had kind of set aside to see what we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| use it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| With that, we did make the decision to add a director of academies and happy to say tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| that we announced last week that Brad Quorum, current principal of Carter High School, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| be moving into that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Brad started the academy structure both at Carnes High School and then went to Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| High School to start that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| He's a seasoned practitioner that I think will be great working with principals as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| work on things like their master schedules and how to maximize these efforts moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| since he's been able to lead that in two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| So we're really excited about Brad being part of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| I want to welcome Mr. Quorum to the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| And with that, I will conclude my comments for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| I'm excited for Mr. Quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| I've worked closely with him when he was a principal at Carnes, so I think he's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| to be a great addition to that, to grow that program in our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| Dr. Reisig, you have a lot to report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| So next on the agenda is Farragut School Solations, and I don't know if you want to start us off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| I know Dr. Adams has some presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| No, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| But I always wanted to say a few things first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| I want to say first to this board, thank you last month for choosing to make the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| I think that you're going to see, and there's a great slide in here and I won't steal your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| slides, but it shows just the proximity to where the current schools are and where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| property is and why it was such an important piece to keep that community kind of whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| as we move forward with what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| So thank you all for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| I know sometimes, you know, the order, we talked about that last time, the chicken or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| the egg, how that works in some communities, you need to make that land purchase so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| can have it before you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| And I just want to say this too, because I know there's been a lot of interest from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| We are very excited as a staff to go out to the community and listen to these community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Dr. Adams is going to speak a lot to that, to find the best solution for Farragut moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| But I do want to remind you that what we talked about in even making decisions and pulling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| out of previous properties is we want to make sure we're thinking long term on every decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| And we want to look at things so that we're not coming back to this board in three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| and asking for another new school and another new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| We want to make sure we exhaust all of our possibilities to look at a feeder pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| from pre-K to 12 to make sure we're expanding all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| So I think what you'll see tonight are some of those plans, three versions of what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| think are good ideas for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| None of this is baked, as you guys know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| It is a little bit of a chicken or the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| We had to bring it to you guys first so you could bless us to go to the community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| get input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| But we're excited to hear that from the community as well and then come back with one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| three or maybe a hybrid version of all this that's the right answer for Farragut moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| It's both fiscally responsible and also takes care of population growth for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| So with that, Dr. Adams, I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you, Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Madam Chair, members of the board, I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to speak with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| I want to echo Dr. Reiswick's sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| We certainly appreciate you all voting on that property for some well-needed land for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| the ongoing growth and the current growth for the Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| So first I'd like to take you all through the timeline of how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| We did a feasibility study to address capacity for traffic concerns, and that was in FY21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| In that study, it recommended that we had a new construction for a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| They also said that current construction on that property was not ideal for the simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| fact that you can't turn that area into a construction site because we are landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| So they recommended that you do have another school off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| Also, again, I'd like to thank you because the board approved the property on Boring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| Road for the new construction of the Farragut school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| So currently, what you see here is our current capacity and enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| As you see, our current enrollment for the Farragut Primary, Farragut Intermediate, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| the Farragut High School, they are currently at overcapacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| The effective capacity, which you see there, that is including our CTE programs, advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| academic programs, SPED, ELL, ART, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| When you look at those specialized programs, those numbers vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| So it's not the traditional 28 students in a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Those numbers can vary, and I can tell you just from my experience as a principal, anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| from 10 to 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| So it looks very differently in the different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| So the challenges in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| So currently, we're using portables for temporary capacity, and three out of four of our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| campuses use portables to address the needs for overcrowding, and those schools are, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| Farragut Primary, Farragut Intermediate, and Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| Overcrowding in the elementaries and the high school have become an issue, and so what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| done in the past is we've just added portables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Well, with the rapid growth in Knox County alone, what we've realized quickly is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| only are portables not the answer moving forward, but when we do order a portable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| it takes us a calendar school year for us to receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| The traffic congestion, this is a complaint that we've received from the community itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| and that's not only for the current campus, but also for all campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| The path to a new school on October the 4th, the board voted to acquire the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| On October the 26th, today, we're doing a presentation for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| On November and December, we are going to do community presentations to get the community's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| I will share those dates at the end of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| After that, in January, we will bring back some solutions for the board to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| The 2025-2026 construction, it is a tentative date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| Now keep in mind, there are several projects that we've had here recently, and that timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| has shifted significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| That is a very ambitious timeline, and I like to be ambitious, but keep in mind that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| shift to 2026-2027 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| The Boring Road property, as you see right now, that gives you an example of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| Farragut schools and the new property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| This property is a very unique property in the sense that it gives us lots of room on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| the campus itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| It's 41 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Just to give you an idea, our campus for the intermediate, middle, and high school, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| is a total of 97 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| It's also within the Farragut zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| It also has great proximity that's convenient as far as routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| It has a main artery, which is Kingston Pike, and so that makes it convenient as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| Also there is a traffic light there, and so that gives us the opportunity to control access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| traffic access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| So three possible solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Before I dive in this, again, I would like to reiterate what Dr. Ryswick said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| One of the main issues that we looked at moving forward is to find a solution when we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| at building schools that were not short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| I believe with the booming growth of Knox County, we have to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| The facilities assessment is one way for us to look at that and look at our facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| currently, but also to get a good understanding on how we expand across all grade levels and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| not just at elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| So option one is to build a new elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| What you see in the right-hand corner is the estimated cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| Now keep in mind that does not include renovations when you talk about whether you have to renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| another school site or removing portables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| That would be an additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| So this option is to build a new middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| This middle school would hold grades K through 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Again, this is the traditional answer to how we would do things in the past for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Did I say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| New elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| I've said middle, elementary, high so many times they all start to run together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| So for a new elementary school, it would be grades K through 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| And it's 1,200 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| The existing primary school would remain a primary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| So you're looking at about 700, serving 706 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| The existing intermediate school would remain an intermediate school, serving 558 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| The existing middle school would remain a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| And so the population currently there is 1,519 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| And the existing high school would remain a high school, grades 9 through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| The pros to this is you get direct relief to overcrowding at Farragut Intermediate School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Farragut Primary Intermediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| In line with the district's traditional response to capacity and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| So this is an answer for immediate relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| It is the least expensive option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| So that is also a pro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| The cons is that we do not address concerns at Farragut Middle or High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| It does not address traffic congestion at Farragut Middle or High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| At any given time between the hours of 8.30 and 3.30, you can have 3,400 students on that campus at one time for dismissal and coming in for the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=912)|
| 0:15:23| And it also requires zoning for the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| So we would be pulling students from the primary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| We'd be pulling students from the intermediate school to create the new elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| Option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| This is looking at building a new middle school, elementary slash freshman academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| This would be a new build of a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| It would host 1,600 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| The existing primary would be converted to a small elementary school, grades K-5, serving 706 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| The existing intermediate, two-thirds of that would expand into the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| And they would be able to serve grades K-5 for 1,400 students, which would be the largest elementary school we currently have in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=958)|
| 0:16:07| One-third of the existing middle school would be renovated for the freshman academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| So again, as we look at capacity across the board, keep in mind that the high school currently has portables on their campus to serve their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=971)|
| 0:16:19| This would give additional space in the middle school wing to add, or we would let the architect decide what wing, but to add capacity for the freshman academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=979)|
| 0:16:31| The existing high school would then become a 10-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| So you'd have a separate freshman academy, and then you'd have a traditional 10-12 grade levels at the Farragut high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| The pros provides a long-term comprehensive solution for all Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| It creates room for growth in four separate schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| It provides dedicated space for a freshman academy, and it eases traffic on the middle and high campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| I pretty much went over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| The cons are that it's a longer process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| It would require construction for the new school, and also renovations to Farragut Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| You would have 1,400 students, which would be the largest school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| It would increase the number of students arriving and departing at the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| So again, it would solve the issues for Farragut Middle School and Farragut High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| but it does increase the number of traffic flow for the elementary school from 1,000 students to 1,400 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| It would also involve rezoning our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| So the new elementary plus middle slash freshman academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| This is building a larger elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| The estimated cost would be $48.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| This new bill would convert the existing elementary school into a small K-5 grade serving 706 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| The existing intermediate school would then be converted into a freshman academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| So that would solve the issue for the new elementary plus middle slash freshman academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| So that would serve 500 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| The existing middle school would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| That population obviously doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| And the existing high school would then become a grades 10 through 12 serving 1,916 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| The pros for this, it provides a long-term comprehensive solution for elementary and high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| It creates room for growth in four separate schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| It provides dedicated space for a freshman academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| And the cons are, it's a longer process and it would require construction of the new school and renovations to the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| 1,400 students, again, is the largest elementary school we would have in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| It does not answer our concerns for traffic for Farragut Middle School and Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| And it does not add capacity for the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| This also would involve rezoning for the elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| So just a quick recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Option one builds capacity in elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| Option two builds capacity at all Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| And option three builds capacity in elementary and high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| So our next steps, again, we will have community listening sessions at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| We will be at Farragut High School on November the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| We'll be at Farragut Primary on November the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| And we'll be at Farragut Middle School on December the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| After we conduct those meetings, we will take that feedback and we will provide the board with the necessary feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| Similar to what we did with Mill Creek, we took Q&As and we would take those Q&As and we would roll them into the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| So we would queue that up for families as we moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| But we would take all of that information, necessary information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| We would provide the necessary feedback for families and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| And then we would share that with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| Does anyone have any questions for Dr. Adams for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| Yes, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| All three options I did hear you say would require rezoning, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| So if anyone out there is listening and planning on buying a home in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| just know that we cannot guarantee school zones with growth the way it is countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| And I do think that's important, you know, because we did hear a lot about that with Mill Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1234)|
| 0:20:45| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| And I will say, you know, as the representative who went through this most recently with the Mill Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| Dr. Adams and his team did a fantastic job with the community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| So I do stress the community to come out to those Q&A sessions because your input matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| So please come to those because they compile everything that is said at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| and put into Q&As for the community, for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| And that's a way to have your voices be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| So I can't stress enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Please come to those sessions for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| Ms. Wharton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Thank you for very creative solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| So one question I know that will come up will be if the renovations are necessary at other buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1287)|
| 0:21:37| you know, a timeline for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| So is there, and it's hard because there's three different options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| so I guess it would be different for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| But it seems like this is going to take a little while to get through no matter which option we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| So do you have any feedback on that or do you think that it would really just kind of depend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| it's just going to vary so much with each option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| I believe it would vary significantly with each option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| However, if the board wanted to secure an architect to look at all three options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| that is a possibility as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| But if the board is willing to vote for whatever option is the board's preference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1332)|
| 0:22:20| we could certainly work with an architect to get that number fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| For the timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| If we had an architect look at them, then we would know better what the timeline would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| If I could jump in real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| I think this is right too, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Any of those three options, though, like the first piece is the new school, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| So if it's a new elementary or if it's a new middle or if it's a new whatever that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| that would have to be built first before renovations to Ms. Horn's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| It's probably going to take multiple years out of that then because once that's built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| you have to move students in order to have a space to renovate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| You wouldn't do the renovation necessarily with the kids in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| So I think that would probably be the first piece and I think that best projected tentative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| was like, was it 26, 27, I think, something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| when you'd have the first piece of it done to then go back and do renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| So it would be multiple years for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Madam Chair, thank you, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Because it's a lot to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Next on our agenda, the development of the 2024-2029 strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| I do get to talk a lot tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Just before Ms. Lautner comes and speaks to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| just so you guys remember from the background, during the board retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| I think that, I think Mr. Watson might have been the one who brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| but just brought to our attention that this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| the 24 is the final year of the current strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| And I know we have things like annual action plan and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| But at that point, the board had brought up to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| could we have kind of an overview of strategic planning and history of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| of that in Knox County and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| So I just want to give a little background that that's what Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| Lautner is going to speak to and then hopefully have some maybe next steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| for you all to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Ms. Lautner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Thank you, Madam Chair, Dr. Reiswick, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| So, yeah, just like Dr. Reiswick said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| our goal here today is to look at some possible options for approaching that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| five year strategic planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| So really we are planning to make a plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| So that is our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| And I'll kick us off with a quote from President Eisenhower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| He said, plans are worthless, but planning is everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| And I really want to hone in on that second part of the quote here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| that planning is everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| because there's a lot that we can get out of a strategic planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| But I want to take a moment and focus on that first sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| If plans are worthless, why create a strategic plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| So I would argue just a little bit with President Eisenhower and say that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| good plan can do a lot for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| So a good strategic plan can create clarity, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| This is that opportunity to create clarity in our mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| in our vision, in our strategic direction as an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| and to use that opportunity to establish some goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| not just for the sake of planning goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| but to really inspire continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| So to give us an opportunity to reflect on what do we want education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| in Knox County to look like for our students one year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| two years from now, three years from now, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| And to generate some shared ownership around that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| So to generate some shared ownership in the community around those goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| and identifying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| what is it that we are uniquely positioned to do as a school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| And what is our community uniquely positioned to do to support us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| as a school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| And so this is a great opportunity to begin those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| And this is also a wonderful opportunity to have a packaged plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| that provides that year after year accountability for us to put into words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| and to put onto paper what we're going to measure ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| and map ourselves against year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| And so that just enhances our accountability as an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| and our transparency as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| So a good strategic plan can do a lot for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| And it's also required under board policy and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| So I also did want to call out just reflecting on state board policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| and also our board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| A couple elements of this expectation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| because I think they're easy to get lost in all of the wording here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| that in addition to being required to establish a five-year strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| there's also this expectation that that plan is reflected on every two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| and that it is routinely reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| So the board has established already a really great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| for that iterative review process in the form of the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| I think that's a great opportunity to perform some of the expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| that are laid out in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| And I would just encourage the board to consider that document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| and that template in the creation of that five-year strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| There is an opportunity to look at this as kind of an entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| strategic planning framework as opposed to having an annual action plan over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| and a five-year strategic plan over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| So I did just want to reflect on that requirement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| And also just to frame kind of our conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| in what a good strategic plan should consist of and should look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| So a good strategic plan, if we really want that to be usable for ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| for our staff, for our families, for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| a good strategic plan has four characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| It's agile, it's ambitious, it's achievable, and it's accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| So an agile plan looks a lot like that annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| It's fundamentally iterative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| You have that regular opportunity to take a step back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| and reflect on what worked, what didn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| what changes do we want to make, what work do we want to persist with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| It's ambitious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| It encourages us to strive and to challenge ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| and our students to reach new goals and to ambition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| toward a place that maybe they hadn't considered previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| or we hadn't considered previously for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| But it's also achievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| We're not setting unattainable goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| So we're setting ambitious goals, and we may not always hit the mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| but we're setting goals that we know are hittable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| And last but not least, and I think this one's always tricky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| when you talk about strategic planning, it's accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| So I think when we start talking about plans being worthless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| if we go back to that original quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| part of where that mentality comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| is that it's very easy to produce a plan that is so dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| or so academic that it's not really accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| to any of the stakeholders that are intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| to be benefited by that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| And so if we think about this as an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| for us to really create an accessible template| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| for our teachers, for our broader school staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| and especially for our students and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| I think this is a great opportunity for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| to dream a little bit about what we want that plan to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| So one of the requests that was made at the last board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| was just for a frame of reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| on what strategic planning has looked like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| in Knox County schools over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| So this is kind of a 15-year snapshot smashed into a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| So there's a lot of information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| But if you look over the course of the past 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| this work has been done a few different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| a few different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| So back in 2009 to 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| there was a pretty robust plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| that was developed by a third-party entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| in concert with a full-time representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| from the Knoxville Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| a full-time dedicated strategic planner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| who was staffed by Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| and an advisory group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| That plan produced four major goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| established 22 different performance targets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| It established a new mission for the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| and a new vision for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| It was a little over 100 pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| and it took about seven months, all told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| And I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| The months and the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Terry and I did the best we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| digging through some old board notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| to try to get you all this historic frame of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| It is a little bit subject to error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| in that we are constrained to board discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and the notes that were taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| So there's some guesswork that's involved in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| So I would give or take a month or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| in each of these timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Between 2014 and 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| this plan was sort of a revisioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| of that previous plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| So instead of hiring a third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| that the board at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| just opted to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| that full-time strategic planner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| again to leverage a steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| and a working group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| to provide kind of a version two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| of the framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| that was developed in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| And that consisted of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| one fewer goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| So three major goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| quite a few fewer objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| So nine objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| and five independent commitments to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| That plan, all told, was about 50 pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| and also took about seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| And then you get into our current iteration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| which is the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| that was adopted back in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| That was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| in concert with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| 10 to 12 KCS executive staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| producing an initial framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| that then went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| some revisioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| through a board committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| that consisted of three members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| and was, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| additionally workshopped by some folks on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Many of you will have lived through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| and I did not see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| so I would rely on your frame of reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| for how exactly that played out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| But that plan produced three major goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| three objectives, a new mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| and a new vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| It was 12 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| It took about 13 months to produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| And so I walk you all through all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| just to highlight the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| that there's no one format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| for a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Strategic plans can have names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| They can be developed by multiple entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| in multiple different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| They can establish different goals, objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| Sometimes they look at mission and vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Sometimes they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Quick pull-out report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| And they take some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| and they take some time and some investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| on somebody's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| And so that was really, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| the main takeaway of this slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| is that they are an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| And so if we think about that investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| there are some decision points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| in the very near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| or near-ish future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| that the board will need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| in thinking about and approaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| the 2024-29 strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| So a couple of those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| are laid out on this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| The board will need to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| the development model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Is this going to be a board-developed plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Is this going to be a plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| we leverage a third party to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| some of that work or all of that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Is this going to be a committee-led plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Is this going to be a staff-led plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| As you saw on the previous table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| it's been done many different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| many different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| We'll need to determine a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| for community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| What does community engagement look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Are we talking focus groups, interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| surveys, some combination of the three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| Where and how many languages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| So there's some nitty-gritty decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| What is it that the board wants to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Are we tackling priorities, goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| objectives, mission, and vision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Some version of all of the above?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Only a couple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Do we want a framework?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Do we want a more prescriptive plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| That would need to be engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| in probably sooner-ish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| than later if we want to produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| a plan by 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| And then, last but not least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| that plan composition and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| thinking about what makes this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| accessible to families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Is it a long-form plan? Is it a short-form plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Is it some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| combination of the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Is it a long plan that has elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| that are pull-outable or pull-downable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| So there are a lot of different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| in approaching the framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| that we want to leverage for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| And we have a recommended approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| just to jump-start this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| for you all. So that was something else that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| the board requested at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| was just some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| in terms of how you all might be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| begin approaching this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| So if we look back at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| the ways that this has been done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| I think some combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| of an all-of-the-above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| would actually benefit the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| And to kick that off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| our recommendation would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| to establish a small planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| committee. So again, thinking back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| to that last slide, there are a lot of very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| granular decisions that might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| tough to be made by a broad committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| that a small committee could tackle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| put together some recommendations, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| to bring back to the full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| So if you think about a small planning committee of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| three to five members, a mixture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| potentially of board and staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| just to do some of that initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| thinking and brainstorming to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| to the board, then a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| proposal for that development model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| the engagement timeline, and some of those initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| details, that would give the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| an opportunity to engage in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| recommendations, make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| yes, no, maybe we sub this out, we sub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| that out, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| task that planning committee to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| with execution. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| when that committee moves forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| execution, then you would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| through the actual iterative process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| strategic planning, land on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| a proposed framework and plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| then to bring back to the board once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| again for the board to react to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| to digest, to potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| adapt or adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| And that is the recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| approach, but by no means the approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| we need to land on. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| again, that was really just inspired to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| begin this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| and I will pause there to see if you all have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2168)|
| 0:36:24| Does anybody have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| questions for Corey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| So then it's up to us, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| our next steps are to figure out what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Like the timeline of forming this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| committee and who's on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Yeah, if you all want to go the committee route. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| strategic plan belongs to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| So really all of the next steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| are up to you all to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| I would have to look at Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Dupler to be certain of this, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| believe if you wanted to form a committee, a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| committee, I don't know if you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| to take action to form the committee, but I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Ms. Henderson, you may need to propose members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| And then we have to vote on it? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| And we'd have to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| No, we wouldn't have to vote on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| I don't know that you vote on the membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Do you vote on the committee? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| Ms. Horne. Thank you, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Chair. Thank you, Corey, for going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| through all that. I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| the idea of a mix of board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| and staff. I feel like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| you know, I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| that's doable and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| that's what we did last time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| so I'd like to hear from other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| what your thoughts are, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I think that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Ms. Christy. I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| with Ms. Horne. I like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| recommended planning committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| as well and having the mix of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| board members with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| I think that would be a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| Reverend Butler. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Where would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| with community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| staff fit into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| this planning, this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| In retrospect, I sat down too soon. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| really know why I did that. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| So, I imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| that once the, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| went the committee route, in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| the committee would spend some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| thinking about, do you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| task some third party?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Do you want to enlist some third party support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| And that might be in the engagement space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| so I think you need to make some of those initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| decisions first. Do you want to task a staff member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| with doing the engagement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Do you want that to be an entirely board-led process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| So, I imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| that conversation begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| in step two and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| make some initial recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| to bring to the board in step three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| that, you know, this is how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| we're going to do community engagement, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| who is going to do community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| and then once the full board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| has said, yes, we really like that idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| along with this development model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| and this proposed timeline, then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| actual engagement work would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| place between steps three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| and steps four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| I know time is of essence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| but I think in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| staff interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| and staff engagement, I think that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| It sometimes works better when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| a third party with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| I'm thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| when you're working with community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| staff can work with community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| but I think when you're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| with staff, staff may give you more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| sincere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| if it's a third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| who's engaging them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| And I'll just chime in to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Reverend Butler. I know you lived through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| the Region 5 strategic planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| process with us and I think one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| the greatest assets we had in that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| was that we had a third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| who was able to conduct that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| engagement work and I think we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| some really honest feedback as a result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| One other question though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| One reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I wanted to bring it back up is I was looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| three is where the board approves the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| process we decide to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| The planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| committee said this is what we think we ought to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| and then the board approves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| So if that is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| then I think the community and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| engagement happens between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| three and five, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| be four. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| where the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| is at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| I know timing on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| crucial so it's something that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| definitely have to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| making these decisions, putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| this committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| I would think next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| is when we need to start getting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| so we can start getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| not only the committee together but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| that input from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| and what does the next five years look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| like for KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| So thank you Corey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Thank you so much. I'd like to just make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| one last comment. This is an overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| comment about strategic planning, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| for this board, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| seems like a long time but also seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| And also we will be updating it. It said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| every two years but we're looking at every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| we're going to have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| But what I do note in a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| of organizations that have five year plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| and such, but you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| a five year board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| You may have a two year board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| And so I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| that what we do, we do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| understanding of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| is what's best for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| schools for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| five years. And as it changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| as things change, we change the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| But if those things don't change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| then we should, the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| shouldn't drastically change or we shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| stop doing something that we said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| that was a target that we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| to do and we still need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| And I'm not sure if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| boards stay consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| That's why I think President Eisenhower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| what he really meant was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| a plan is worthless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| if you don't follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| I was thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| the same thing when you put that quote up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| there, Corey. I'm like, you can have a plan, you can have a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| plan, but if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| if you don't implement it or use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| correctly or, you know, this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| should outlive this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| whether that be two years or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| And I know this process is new to many of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| This is the first time I'm going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| going through a new strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| so I look forward to this process and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Okay, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| if there's no more discussion on that, we'll move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| our next item, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| the review of the superintendent's evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| tool and timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| And I know this is something that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| discuss at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| retreat a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| I know Corey is going to lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| us in that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Or Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| Mr. Bolton is going to lead us, kick us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2596)|

| 0:43:28| and we know that's not accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| information, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Madam Chair, board members, thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| kind of outline and speak to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| about Dr. Rysluk's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| evaluation. You should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| have in front of you a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| items. You should have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| approved evaluation tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| that you all acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| You should see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| drafted timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| that we had talked about previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| And you should also see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| evaluation 360| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| that should also be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| I wanted to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| just a few moments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| if you would find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| the performance evaluation guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| that's outlined on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| second page of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| the evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| I just wanted to bring your attention to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| and kind of go over those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| So a few things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| what we had talked about, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| evaluation will take place in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| January, that's January of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| You all will score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| performance based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| that objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| the objective based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| evaluation model as outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| in this. And I wanted to, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| flip over beyond that page just to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| at for an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| flip over to the actual page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| of the document which would be on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| 7 of 13, you would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| those performance objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| and then you would see everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| from below expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| up to significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| above expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| You'll see below that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| supporting evidence for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| of those things that you can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| evaluation in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| as you determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| how you feel as though the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| has performed on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| things. I want to remind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| particularly that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| scoring the indicator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| not the supporting evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| You can use the supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| evidence as far as for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2735)|

| 0:45:47| the indicator as listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2747)|

| 0:45:59| for REA to kind of provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| a scoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2761)|

| 0:46:05| You could also, you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| to expect some narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| data as well as you evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| and score those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| objective things. And then there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| where you'll get both when you look to score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| that indicator. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| REA will provide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2781)|

| 0:46:29| and score for each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| And then also consider the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| annual plan report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| The one thing I want to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| as you go through that document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| I don't know if you've had time to see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| electronic version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| of that document but as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| actually click those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| the score will populate on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| document. But please know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| and it's important that I tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| if you fail to score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| if you failed, if no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| score is given on a certain indicator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| the score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| will not be counted in that calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| So keep that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| And so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| wanted to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Jennifer, do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Madam Chair, members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| of the board, I think you covered it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| pretty well. You also have a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| of the 360 evaluation if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| are questions about that. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| that Corey is available to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| more on the, if an objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| is not scored then the score won't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| The evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| itself will automatically divide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| the scoring by 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| so if for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| one objective was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| scored then that would be changed to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| divide by 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| any questions for Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Does anyone have any questions? I know this is a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| process for some board members so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Yes, thank you Madam Chair. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| for the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| This is for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| We have supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| evidence for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| but we only have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| at this point one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| So are we, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| are we, what's the suggestive way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| we utilize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| so that some of us are not doing one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| and some of us are doing another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| I can't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| speak to the utility but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| I believe if I'm thinking back to the board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| original conversation around why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| that three year longitudinal data was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| asked for was really just to have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| identification of trends. So are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| anticipating that if this score is trending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| upward, do we see that year after year or did we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| really see a big impact last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| So that just gives you an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| or an opportunity to compare potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| growth or regression against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| prior years trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2933)|
| 0:49:01| Anyone else have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| Thank you Mr. Moulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| Well there's no further questions on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| We will move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| public forum, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| Yes, thank you Madam Chair. We do have a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| So Wendy Brinley, I believe the name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| is. And Wendy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| if you will state your name and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| of residence and then you will have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| Good evening. My name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Wendy Brinley. I am a Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| resident, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| I've resided in Farragut for 11 years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| and both of my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| attend Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| First of all, I want to commend the Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| teachers, administrations and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| for doing their absolute best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| These people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| are my heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| So please don't misconstrue anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| that I say is negative on anyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Everybody's been doing their best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| with the tools that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| And I thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| making the purchase and seeing the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| that we have in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| because our schools are starting to bust at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| seams and have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| What I'm here tonight to advocate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| is what I think is the benefit of all Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| students, not just my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| because the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| if I got my way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| the chance of them being in a new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| is nil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| My kids are not going to be in a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| building. I think this is what is best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| for all Farragut students and the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| what is developmentally appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231026?start=3045)|
