| 0:06:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Do you know what the server compliance letter is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| It's just basically how you're going to train the servers to be sure that they don't sell to underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| or over-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=412)|

| 0:06:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| And the Metropolitan Drug Commission is in the back, the lady in the very back row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| She can probably help you put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| And then I know you've already got a designation letter from the IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| and we just need a photocopy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=427)|

| 0:09:10| Mr. Frost, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| This, I mean, this is obviously an ordinance related to the sale of beer that certain signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| must be posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Apparently, the applicant, for some reason, didn't have a sign posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| You know, not saying one way or the other, but this is probably one of the more minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| of the possible offenses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| But nevertheless, it is an offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| I would recall, remind the beer board that in the past, someone with a similar offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=582)|
| 0:09:51| they were approved and another one, another person who had been convicted was given the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| opportunity, likewise, to go back and seek it to be expunged from their record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| So there's some options out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Do you have signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Right now, we have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| And you have them posted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| So if we all walk in there at the end of this meeting tonight, we'll see those signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Well, this is in my district, so do we have everything in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| I will move that we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Well, it says here you've got a manager that hasn't submitted a background or fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Then we will defer this until the August 19th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| So I'd like to move that we defer to the August 19th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=648)|

| 0:10:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Now, the manager who doesn't have the documentation done, the task class and all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| has to have those done by August the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=658)|

| 0:12:01| Just pull it down closer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Is this better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=724)|

| 0:12:08| Mary Millsaps, 1317 Island Home Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| 7920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Officer Price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| We need the building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals and the surrender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| of the former owner's permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| When are you planning to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Labor Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| So you've got some time then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| How's this different from the place that was previously at that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Ball and beers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Ball and beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Well, I'm not familiar with what was previously there, but I'm hoping that it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| an improvement based on what I've seen of the building and the property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| Ball and beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Well, that's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Yeah, I'd like to add, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Gary, former Councilman Gary Underwood owns this property, and I've had some discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| with Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| And this is going to be right outside of the new apartments that are coming up in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| to the housing, all the goings on at the former Baptist site and then the Island Home folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| So an upgrade, I think, will be a gold mine for anyone that can come in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| They're going to expand the kitchen, have comfort food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| But it will be different than what's been in there in past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| So, I mean, I really welcome them into South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| We've kind of been waiting on the ... I thought I had somebody roped in that was here earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| this evening, but he went to a place downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| But I'm just really excited about them coming and being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| I think it will be a great establishment for much-needed folks in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| They don't have to cross the bridge if they don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| And I think this is probably a good example of, if you will, that they will come with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| the apartments, Sutter Landing and other things going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| This is another one of the hot spots in the First District, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| And, oh, Vol in Beers Bar on Martin Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=850)|
| 0:14:21| April Robertson, 3846 Martin Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Before we proceed, they had asked for dancing, and the fire marshal says they do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| enough room to dance, so they're just going to drink and do whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| Not dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Not dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| We need a copy of the sales tax registration and the former permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Do I hear them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| This is another First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| I was distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Is everything approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| I was just trying to think in my mind of something else to say, and I will when I get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Is there a second on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Before he takes the floor to talk, when are you planning to open and start serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| As soon as we're approved by you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| So that was the form and VETS before, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| It was VETS, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| So I'm equally excited for you, and everybody that's come from the First District tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| to enhance what the experience in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| I know you run a good organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| We're doing the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Before we got to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Did the hot rod group come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Well, we have three administrative hearings tonight, and so let's begin with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| The three hearings, two of them have a second violation within two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| and one of them has a second violation within three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| As you know, according to the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| we can only address those who have had the violations within two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| The first one on the list is NAMA doing business as Shucks Raw Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=968)|
| 0:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| This is the second violation in less than two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| The first violation was March 17, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| This one was May 28, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| The code requires a $500 fine and a plan, and we can also send this to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| That's one thing we're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| The other thing we'll be considering is the TABC issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| So the first thing that we need to discuss and vote on is whether you want to send them to the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| for having two violations in a short amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| or do you want to just accept they've paid the fine and submitted a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| What is the status of the TABC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| The TABC requires it to go to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| They're sending them to a hearing, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| Yes, and we'll look at that after we deal with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| So they're going to one hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Okay, so we're in agreement that we'll accept your $500 fine and your plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| and we will never see you again for a violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Now we go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| TABC gave them a 15-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| So according to the rules and the law that was in effect at the time of the citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| we need to send them to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Can we not accept the TABC ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Not, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| We cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Let's have a second hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| The law that was in effect at the time they were cited required that they go to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| if they were cited by TABC, they had to go, we had to send them for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| If we cited them, TABC has to send them for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| That was the law that was in effect on the date that they were cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| So my question is, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| And Ms. Mitchell will be in touch with you with the information about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| The second one is Kingston Alley doing business as Doc's All-American Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| They had a five-day suspension for a February 6, 2014, underage sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| This is the second sale underage, but the first one was in 2011, and that's outside the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| So essentially, we're looking at a new rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| This is a TABC suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| So this needs to go to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| So they've already been to one TABC hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Yes, and they had a five-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| I make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| And we'll be in touch about the TABC, I mean, about the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| The next one is Chewy's, and Chewy's was cited by TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| And the date of their first citation was January 2, 2013, and most recently was May 28, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1168)|
| 0:19:37| They've not paid their – have they paid their financing plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| This is a TABC hearing only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| This would be to go to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| My name is Greg Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| I'm an attorney in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| I'm here on behalf of Chewy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| My address is 800 South Gay Street, Suite 1650, 37929.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| And I'm here on behalf of Chewy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| It's my understanding, in response to a first offense letter that we received from the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1207)|
| 0:20:15| if you follow Title 55, we all know that the property does not flow with the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1215)|
| 0:20:24| Chewy's is under new ownership with regard to selling alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| If I had to bet, I would think that's why KPD sent us a first offense remedial letter, and we submitted a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| And your betting is correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| But what we need to consider is the TABC suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| And that – you were – Chewy's was cited on May 28, 2014 for an underage sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| And the law, in effect at that time, required that we send this to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| Very respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| It's our position that the law sunset on July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| It makes no exceptions to whether or not a notice was sent out prior to July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| As of July 1, that law sunset, and there's no exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| Our position is it's a first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| We submitted a remedial plan, and we're prepared to pay a fine if necessary if this board dictates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1278)|
| 0:21:27| However, I think it's – if I could just give an opinion, and it's just an opinion, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| I think if we – if you send us to a hearing officer and a hearing officer agrees with the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1293)|
| 0:21:42| then where we're going to end up is Chantry Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| I know that's not anybody's concern, but it's – I feel pretty strongly that this is a – the law is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| It sunset July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| This board does not have to follow what ABC did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| And I see – I know this board doesn't accept ABC telling it what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| I'm not saying ABC's done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| But because the law sunset, and this is a first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| I think we're going to be wasting a lot of time and effort by going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| But, of course, that's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| I'll answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Mr. Frost, would you tell us about your conversation today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Thank you, Mr. Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| I have to respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| Chewy's was caught and cited, and it's – everything was done under the law that was in place at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1344)|
| 0:22:35| While it is true that the law sunset, I've had a couple conversations with the law department today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| who also spoke with Keith Bell, the executive director of the TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| Mr. Bell said it is the TABC's position that since Chewy's was cited when the law was in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| that they would expect the law to be followed at the time that Chewy's was found in violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1376)|
| 0:23:05| and actually entered an agreed order, if I recall correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| They entered an agreed order on that violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| They did do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Like I said, though, whatever the TABC's position or interpretation of the law is not binding on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| They're totally separate entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| I would respectfully request of this board not to ignore what ABC does because you work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| but they don't interpret the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| They're not the courts, and they don't have any bearing or binding effect on this board at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| And our position is the law sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| I think that we probably have some disagreement between your interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| and the fact that when this citation was issued, we were under a specific law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| Now, this beer board has not discussed changes that occurred on July the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| because I didn't want to muddy the waters until we were ready to get in the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| So let's not do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| But this board needs to decide the law that was in effect on May the 28th when they were cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| and did require that they go to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Now, I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| If this board votes to go to the hearing officer, you'll have an opportunity to argue again your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| So, board, do we want to discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Do we want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Tell me what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| I take it based on our counsel, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| summation of where he reads this that he believes that the rules in effect at the time of the citation govern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| So I think we should vote to send them to the hearing officer, and then they can argue it in the proper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| So you can take your case to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| The spitual will be in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| You know the drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| You've done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| How's our hot rod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Is the hot rod group here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Well, I guess they ran out of gas before they got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| They were missing a background check and fingerprints, so we couldn't really do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Do you want to postpone this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Do I have a motion to defer this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| I will make a motion, Madam Chair, to postpone it to the next meeting of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| And that's in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Now, I just do want to tell you that even though the rules that we followed prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| July 1st did sunset, there is a new law that addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| And the law department and Mr. Frost are working on an information piece for us so that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1548)|
| 0:25:56| know where we stand, where we don't stand, what we can do, and what we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| But there has been some change, I believe, in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| We were in a trial period, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| We were one of those people who were models or whatever you want to call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| And so that piece is over, and now there is a statewide law that went into effect July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| Are we going to be briefed now by our counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Well, if you want to be briefed, then he can do it in four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| Take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Basically, that, as Mr. Harrison referenced, that law did sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| But I, as well as the law department, as well as the ABC are of the opinion, if someone was caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| while that law was still in effect, it comes to this city council, which is supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| automatically pass it along to the hearing officer with no, there's no discretion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| With the sunset of the law, discretion will exist for if an entity gets caught after July 1 by the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1608)|
| 0:27:01| So new citations that come in after that July 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| There's discretion, and people can make an argument if they've won punishments enough kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| So we won't be into this, what we've been into so far, where we have, they do a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| and then we have to do, you know, they're just one hearing for one violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Well, no, they're going to, Bill, the ABC will notify us, and they will come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| and then it will be up to the beer board whether or not, there will be discretion here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| whether or not to send them on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Your hands aren't tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Previously, it was just straight to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Give us a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| If the state did a sting tonight, what would occur, and somebody served underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Well, I guess it would depend on how the state was going to prosecute the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| or if there was an agreed order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| In most circumstances, as you'll see in your packets, there are agreed orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| And they'll come and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| that we will suspend selling of liquor by the drink for 5, 10, 15, however many days, and pay a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1685)|
| 0:28:14| And there's language in each of those orders that talks about how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| they admitted their guilt, basically, and that, you know, if they ever get in trouble again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| their admission can be used against them in that subsequent violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| Well, now if someone's going to get cited, I'd imagine the same thing will be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| but it will come here and people will be able to argue whether or not they've made the corrective steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| so you all would not have to send them on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| It would not be an automatic path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| And I think that probably this board will need to have some discussion so that we can be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| because I would not want to say, well, Councilman Della Vopi is a nice guy and this is his first transgression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| so we won't do anything more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| And then Councilman Saunders, you know, he's made a practice of selling to underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| so we'll send him on to the we need to be consistent and we'll need to talk about this and develop some rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| I hesitate to use the word workshop because sometimes we don't get as excited about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| you rolled your eyes, Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| But I think that probably at the next meeting we might, if we have a shorter thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| Plus you mentioned, referred to him as a nice guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| I guess that was a hypothetical, though, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Saunders has the nickname Finbad, so he might have a different punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| I was going to say, why can't if someone has two violations that we just don't automatically say that person has to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| Well, I believe you're required to have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| We still have to have the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Oh, you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| If they have two violations, they have to have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Well, under the city ordinances, if it's a beer, if it's three violations, it doesn't even come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| At that point it's been escalated where it just goes straight and Ms. Evertine will file a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1804)|
| 0:30:12| But just like tonight, we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| One, some of them had already been to the TABC hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| We could have voted to send them back to another hearing, and we chose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| We said one hearing is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| And that's what's going to go forward, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| And we're not going to be into this double jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| They're going to be there for a matching suspension of selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| But the second thing for Shuff, that you all did have discretion because that was not related to the TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Seeing no other business before this board, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140722?start=1853)|
