| 2:17:52| The amendment can assist in redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| And it's Knoxville Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| Yeah, Knoxville Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| Yeah, you said city, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| Will this have a fiscal note in any way, shape, or form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| They are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:30| I would imagine some sort of fiscal note we'll have to get with KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8310)|
| 2:18:34| because they may have some funding that covers part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| Then we'll get with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| And then if there's a transportation piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| I don't know who covers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| But we'll have to get an amount for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| I just don't know what KCDC has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| So will that come back to this body then after the fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| It will have to be an appropriation for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| But we at least have an entity that does this work instead of going strictly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| outside for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| Yeah, I think KCDC does this for the city of Knoxville all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| And I don't think what they did, they did one around the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8349)|
| 2:19:13| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| And I don't know who did the Charlie Park study for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| And we would have a partner with the city to share costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| I just have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| Is the motion to direct or to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| Ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| How will we know the scope of work that they're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| I feel like I was pretty, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| direct on specific things that I thought we needed to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| Will they bring that to us before they start this study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| Or is it just kind of we went from a 500-foot view to a 2,000-square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| view from exit ramp to exit ramp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| Well, the highest and best use is usually a pretty encompassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| It's less where your motion was more focused on the condition of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| building in some aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| This is more on the market conditions of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| and what is the best use of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| Maybe it is government offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| But it's a little bit broader in what needs to be done there to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| in order to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| you've got a pretty good development ring around the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| The mall itself is what needs to be redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| But how it redevelops also plays into the pieces that are around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8431)|
| 2:20:37| the roads that are around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| and the type of businesses that are around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| I'm just suggesting that this is probably a better approach to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| and I hope you'll all support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8445)|
| 2:20:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| Commissioner Smith, you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| This whole motion sounds very much like what Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8460)|
| 2:21:06| and what we were trying to say earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| We want to see what that whole area over there and what it can impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8468)|
| 2:21:15| And if it doesn't take Knox County stepping out and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| we want to look at this entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| I believe we said the entire area and transportation and the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| I think we pulled everything in there as to see what this whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8487)|
| 2:21:33| and what we could help to go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| and help push along to cause the whole area to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| I mean, I drive those roads every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| I know what the traffic is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| I know all the ins and outs of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| And so I think we're basically saying the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| that just maybe there needed to be somebody else's word in there to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| I mean, all we're asking for is for Knox County to take this seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8519)|
| 2:22:05| We have an opportunity to go out in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| and see what can happen with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| We didn't say anything about moving city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| and we didn't say anything about moving all the county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8535)|
| 2:22:19| We specifically have had one thing in front of us was about the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8539)|
| 2:22:24| And then we went from there as to what could happen out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8544)|
| 2:22:29| if we allow ourselves to give this a fair opportunity for the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8549)|
| 2:22:36| to see what can develop in that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| to affect everybody in the county and surrounding counties and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8560)|
| 2:22:47| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| That motion is promptly before us with the substitute amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| We also have a friendly amendment that was added onto this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| which was brought back by two folks who were on the prevailing side of the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8580)|
| 2:23:05| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8588)|
| 2:23:09| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| All right, Madam Clerk, I think that puts us back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| and I think the Patients Award tonight goes to Ms. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| I want to thank you for your patience in sticking with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| In fact, with that, I hope my fellow commissioners will grant me this also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| as a thank you for all the time you've put in tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| I encourage you to speak early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| By the way, my wife just texted me there's a thunderstorm coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8623)|
| 2:23:49| I do want to give you a chance to speak to us again because, frankly, you spoke earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| and that was an effort, frankly, to make sure you made your statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| and give you a chance to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| But we've talked about a whole lot of stuff since you made that original statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| But out of fairness to you, I do want to give you a chance to just say a couple more words here at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| and then we're going to move into discussion of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| You may not want to go through your whole statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| but I do want to recognize you for your perseverance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| and give you a chance to do another brief recap as we shift our brains back into this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| We'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| I'm going to have the clerk read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| I wanted to recognize you first because you came up on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| Actually, if you don't mind, I'll go ahead and allow the clerks to go ahead and reread this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| and then I'm going to call on you to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| This will be just a minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| Item number 40, consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| permitting Knox County Code, Chapter 54, by adding a new Article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| entitled Sidewalk Construction Standards for New Commercial Developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| and Residential Developments Greater than Five Lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| to establish the location requirements and general specifications for the installation of sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| and new developments or redevelopments permitted in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| Knox County Code, Chapter 54, Article 4, previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| This is on first reading, Ordinance O-19-12-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8706)|
| 2:25:12| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| Ms. Cooley, the floor is once again yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| Thank you for putting up with this long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| I won't restate all the previous statements I made, but I do want to add a few other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8721)|
| 2:25:28| The ordinance will be a disincentive to developers who have been including sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8728)|
| 2:25:34| on all their streets within their subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| The cost analysis that was presented at the workshop is fallacious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8738)|
| 2:25:44| in that you're comparing apples to oranges when you compare sidewalk construction to asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8744)|
| 2:25:51| Once sidewalks are constructed with all the appropriate standards, they last 40 to 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8751)|
| 2:26:00| Asphalt has to be replaced every 8 to 10 years on most streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| and also the asphalt construction costs did not include gutter and curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8765)|
| 2:26:11| if those are indicated by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| And gutter and curb do add significant costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8775)|
| 2:26:22| Sixty percent of new homeowners want sidewalks in their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8782)|
| 2:26:29| This is consistent with the population that is buying new homes out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8789)|
| 2:26:38| They want to be able to walk places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| They want their children to be able to walk to the neighbor's house on a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8801)|
| 2:26:47| Speeding is considerably worse than it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| The number of cars, traffic volume has increased, which increases the risk of being hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8813)|
| 2:27:00| So I think that will conclude my comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8820)|
| 2:27:06| and I would appreciate if you might postpone this vote so that we can get some more public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| because the final language on this ordinance was just completed last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8832)|
| 2:27:19| and has not been put out to the public at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| I recognize, in order of light so far, Commissioners Anders, then Daly, and then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| I'm sorry, John, but those were the first three I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| I guess, I'm sorry you just sat down, Ms. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| I had a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| I didn't get an opportunity to say something before you sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| I read your email, and then I got your letter in the snail mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| Did you hear the discussion in regards to sidewalks on arterial roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| and maybe the county working through those instead of including them in every subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| but in the feeder roads, especially around schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| but in the feeder roads connecting neighborhoods but not necessarily within the neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| Did you hear that discussion in the MPC discussion at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8889)|
| 2:28:18| According to this ordinance, out on the arterial roads, it would only be one-fourth mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8898)|
| 2:28:26| Most people—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8906)|
| 2:28:27| Ms. Cooley, could you talk up just a little bit louder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| I apologize for the storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| We're now having a storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| The language in this ordinance requires the developers to, out on the frontage roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8913)|
| 2:28:39| to only add sidewalks for one-fourth mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8919)|
| 2:28:46| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8926)|
| 2:28:47| I don't think it's going in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| You're leaning on the mute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| Tell you what I'd do is try to pull it for you because there might be a button in front of this mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| It's just occasionally going in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| You're leaning on the mute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| I'm not touching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| Is he leaning on the mute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8944)|
| 2:29:05| He thought you were somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| Anyway, one-fourth mile is really not an adequate distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| because most people will readily walk a half mile to a destination, a 10-minute walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8953)|
| 2:29:19| So that's one of the conditions in the ordinance is that it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8959)|
| 2:29:24| When a sidewalk is being constructed on the frontage road, it's required to be one-fourth mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| And that's just really not a significant amount of sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| Thank you, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8978)|
| 2:29:39| Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8979)|
| 2:29:44| I guess I'm having the same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| We have a development going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| Jim, what's Highland View?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| Is that the subdivision's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8993)|
| 2:30:01| I'm not hitting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| It's the weather, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| We have like 60 feet of right-of-way there for the entrance, maybe 80 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| which would be the time you put the road in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| For that developer to put a sidewalk there is going to be two foot, five foot on each side or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9014)|
| 2:30:20| which is a mile away from Chapman Highway or Bower Ball Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9020)|
| 2:30:26| I have a concern that if we was to try the force, which I think KK Knox Planting did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9026)|
| 2:30:34| they're going to make him put sidewalks inside that subdivision that is nothing but basically a hillside going off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9034)|
| 2:30:41| dropping into the valley, a ridge going this way and a ridge going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9041)|
| 2:30:46| How do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| This would be on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| It would be a sidewalk to nowhere for sure for years and years and years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9051)|
| 2:30:56| But what about inside that subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| How do you feel about inside that, a subdivision that is well over a mile away from Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9058)|
| 2:31:05| I would like to know how many housing units you're talking about in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| I also would like to know what is the distance from the entrance to the subdivision to the last house in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:19| Are they all going to have 26 foot road width all the way to the last house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:28| Are we willing to say as you get down that connector road and get on to some of the side roads or other roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9088)|
| 2:31:36| can the road width go to 22 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| The reason I say that is when the 26 foot roadway is an incentive to go faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9099)|
| 2:31:47| You have all that space and people speed on 26 foot wide roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9107)|
| 2:31:54| A narrower roadway actually lowers the speeds at which people drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9114)|
| 2:32:01| and can make the street more walkable if there's no sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| And if the grade, if it's up and down, there's significant grading problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9125)|
| 2:32:12| then maybe have, and that's in this ordinance, that there might be an alternative walking path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9132)|
| 2:32:21| an asphalt path that could be suggested, something that would still allow people to get out and walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9141)|
| 2:32:27| But if you have a steep hill and you have no path or no sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9147)|
| 2:32:35| it actually becomes even more of a barrier for someone to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| especially if they have any physical disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| It's very hard to walk in grassy slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| I do know that, and I did not know this until I forwarded an email to Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9168)|
| 2:32:56| and there are 26 feet in the subdivisions for off-street parking or on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9176)|
| 2:33:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| So most of your subdivisions are going to be 26 or is there ever anything less than 26, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9185)|
| 2:33:12| There are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| Recently, when the subdivision regulations were revised to include the slope and hillside recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9195)|
| 2:33:25| in those areas the Planning Commission can allow, in consultation with us, narrower streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9205)|
| 2:33:31| But I think it's worded down to 22, is what Ms. Cooley said, is the recommended width during those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9211)|
| 2:33:39| I, you know, that's one example of where I think that maybe we really need to look at forcing someone to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9219)|
| 2:33:50| But then I would take on Highway 33, Severe Meadows, which is within a quarter of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9230)|
| 2:33:56| that's not even that far, an eighth of a mile from the I.C. King Park entrance, where they need sidewalks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9236)|
| 2:34:03| That's a prime example where we need sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| And maybe this quarter of a mile from public facilities, libraries, parks, and senior centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9247)|
| 2:34:13| maybe a quarter of a mile might be a little too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| We may need to increase that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| Yeah, I agree with you completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| It's very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9261)|
| 2:34:22| You and I know very well, together at Mount Olive Hill Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9262)|
| 2:34:26| that you cannot even walk along Maryville Pike to get to I.C. King Park, which is only 200 yards, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9266)|
| 2:34:34| A little farther, but yeah, you're real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| Real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9276)|
| 2:34:37| And that's not unusual in Knox County or even some places in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| that there's these barriers that are not much distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9283)|
| 2:34:49| So I just think this needs to be thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9289)|
| 2:34:55| I'll give a quick example, then I'll turn it over to Gap Creek Elementary and New Hope Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9295)|
| 2:35:02| I would say, yes, sidewalks, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| You know, a mile in each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| I think that's parental zone anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| It's in the parental zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| I suppose we need sidewalks, but down below there where it's connecting to nowhere, I can't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:20| Well, that's why on arterial roads, I don't know that we need sidewalks on a lot of arterial roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9320)|
| 2:35:29| because the subdivisions do get farther apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| But people that live within a subdivision, and for children that live outside of the PRZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| they're dropped off at the entrance to that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| And subdivisions are so large, it's about a mile for them to walk to get to their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9343)|
| 2:35:49| And I feel strongly that at least sidewalks on one side are very beneficial within neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9349)|
| 2:35:56| so that people can walk out their front door and take a 10- or 15-minute walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9356)|
| 2:36:03| and that children can walk to neighbors' houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| and that this is very beneficial to the neighborhood as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| And this is what new homebuyers are interested in having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9370)|
| 2:36:14| And this ordinance discourages developers from putting sidewalks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9374)|
| 2:36:22| because of the requirement to have the homeowners assume the cost of maintenance of those sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9382)|
| 2:36:32| That's going to be very difficult for the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| because they're going to have to pass that along to each individual homeowner that comes by the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9395)|
| 2:36:42| I apologize, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| I know it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| This is not the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9406)|
| 2:36:49| We'll be bringing this again next month because this is the first reading, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| Oh, we don't have a public hearing on this. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| Mr. Snowden, what's the average life of a sidewalk and what would it cost us to maintain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9418)|
| 2:37:04| Once we take it over, it belongs to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| As far as Ms. Cooley's right, I mean, you know, if concrete will last longer than asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9430)|
| 2:37:17| there's no question about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| that the problem we run into in a lot of locations in residential settings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| is where, you know, on an arterial collector, we have a pretty good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9443)|
| 2:37:29| We permit the work that's occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| There's not as many homes immediately adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| We can control that right away a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9454)|
| 2:37:37| In a residential setting, people install sprinkler systems, irrigation, lighting, trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9457)|
| 2:37:43| all manner of things in the right of way that over time create maintenance issues for that sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9463)|
| 2:37:50| And, you know, like I said the other day, we've got $14 million in ADA liability in our residential streets right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9470)|
| 2:37:57| And, yes, some of those were probably related to poor construction practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| but a good many of those were done because homeowners chose to do things in the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9481)|
| 2:38:07| adjacent to the sidewalk that now we're responsible for the maintenance of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| So I guess that's one of our concerns with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9491)|
| 2:38:16| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9500)|
| 2:38:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9501)|
| 2:38:22| Mr. Snowden, could you just talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| obviously this is not the first time this body has talked about sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| but this is a new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| Can you just give us a little understanding of what we used to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| and what is this change actually doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| Because there's a little bit of a miscommunication, I think, with the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| that we're getting rid of all sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| It's more of a process change than it is a you have to do, you can't do, da-da-da-da.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| So can you just explain that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9532)|
| 2:38:53| Yeah, what we'd like to do with this is to get this body's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9533)|
| 2:38:58| on where you all think sidewalks are necessary and beneficial for the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| We gave you what we think that suggestion should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| In the Minimum Subdivision Regulations for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| the language is really clear when it comes to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| that the city of Knoxville Engineering Department makes decisions for city streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| in regard to sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9557)|
| 2:39:18| In the county, that decision is deferred to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9558)|
| 2:39:23| and we feel like that's a little inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| We would rather my staff and engineering staff that maintain the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9565)|
| 2:39:31| and have to maintain them operationally make a lot of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9571)|
| 2:39:37| And you're exactly right, all the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| You know, like we're building Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| You know, that's one of Mr. Schoonmaker's most popular projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| In rebuilding of that, we're going to put sidewalks on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| and greenways on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| I feel like we try to do a very good job in strategically placing pedestrian facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9590)|
| 2:39:55| where they're going to be most utilized by the most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9595)|
| 2:40:00| What we think, though, is in interior to subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| crash data does not support the need for that expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| either by the developer or by us for long-term maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| We would rather focus those locations on adjacent streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| to where the public at large can use those and benefit from those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| And over time, we can create a network of walkable streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| that are included in the PRZ and in the commercial nodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| so that people can safely walk to the places that they are ultimately going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| So we feel like the language presented is appropriate and reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| And we certainly want to provide for safe pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| That's our main goal, whether it's vehicle or pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9645)|
| 2:40:49| We certainly are looking out for the safety of all the Noss County taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| and trying to do so in the most cost-effective means possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| If I heard you correctly, this essentially changes the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| from being completely in the Planning Commission's purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9659)|
| 2:41:06| to essentially you're changing how you structure it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| to having it be in your department's purview exactly like the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9670)|
| 2:41:15| That is correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| We would revise the subdivision regulation language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| to reflect exactly the same consideration the city of Knoxville has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9682)|
| 2:41:26| The county does not have that consideration right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| A question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| Thank you, Mr. Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| A question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| Ma'am, just quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| Ms. Cooley, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9700)|
| 2:41:44| You stated a couple times that new homebuyers are interested in sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| That's what they want, I think is what you said, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9710)|
| 2:41:51| If that's the case, then wouldn't developers want to put in sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| if that attracts better buyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| I mean, isn't that part of the free market enterprise in which buyers have a choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| If they want sidewalks and they want that amenity, they can buy in that division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| And if a developer is not selling a product because he doesn't have that amenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| then certainly he or she might correct that behavior in future developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| First off, I don't consider a sidewalk an amenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| so I think it's part of what should be in a road or street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| And I prefer to call neighborhoods streets where traffic volumes are low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| and speed limits are low so that people who live in that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| feel comfortable walking in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| So many of our neighborhoods, people do not walk at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| because they are fearful to even go out and walk in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9759)|
| 2:42:44| I am a retired physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| I took care of many patients out in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9766)|
| 2:42:49| I recommended to them that they walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| Ten minutes, that's all I asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| Oh, I don't go out in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| That's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| And there's information, there's data that supports that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9781)|
| 2:43:06| that people will not go out and walk when they don't feel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| So I just feel strongly that we need to have something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9791)|
| 2:43:16| either narrow roads, lower speed limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9796)|
| 2:43:20| where people feel comfortable to go walk in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| or we have sidewalks on streets that are too wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9805)|
| 2:43:29| to have a physical effect on speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9809)|
| 2:43:37| So just making sure I just understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| So your preference is that everyone is required to put in sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9819)|
| 2:43:45| in every development no matter what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| No, that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| The MPC, when it was voted on initially, the wording did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9829)|
| 2:43:53| the wording that I understood from the, once again, it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| it's a communication problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| This was voted on twice by the MPC, the first time in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9838)|
| 2:44:04| and the second time in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| And it passed both times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| In 2018 it actually passed by more votes than it did in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9849)|
| 2:44:14| It had specific, more specific language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| It said in subdivisions more than 12 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| and also that there could be a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9860)|
| 2:44:25| and this was mentioned in the new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| a process by which the developer could, because of topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9867)|
| 2:44:32| ADA concerns, that there could be an alternative to sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9872)|
| 2:44:38| meaning an asphalt path that maybe meanders through the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| so that people can still get out and move around within their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9882)|
| 2:44:46| So it wasn't totally rigid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9886)|
| 2:44:49| But this, you just heard Mr. Snowden said that this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| essentially takes the decision making from the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| and puts it into the hands of engineers, just like the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9897)|
| 2:45:00| So do you have a problem with how the city does their sidewalk decision making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9900)|
| 2:45:04| There are essentially no new subdivisions in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9904)|
| 2:45:08| to address this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| Okay, so it's a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9909)|
| 2:45:10| Yes, and the city right now, for any major redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| is requiring sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| There is no ordinance, but it's understood that when there's a new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9917)|
| 2:45:22| along commercial usually, that a sidewalk will be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9922)|
| 2:45:29| in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9929)|
| 2:45:33| Okay, last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9933)|
| 2:45:34| Anything in this ordinance does not prevent anybody from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9934)|
| 2:45:39| any development from actually installing sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| or making that part of their plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| It doesn't prevent anybody from adding sidewalks in any way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| It doesn't prevent anyone from adding sidewalks except that there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| if you read the exact language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9950)|
| 2:45:54| that the developer of property may install sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9954)|
| 2:46:00| in addition to those sidewalks required by this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| Prior to the installation of such additional sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| the developer shall record a maintenance agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| obligating subsequent landowners to maintain these sidewalks in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9970)|
| 2:46:17| The maintenance agreement shall be in a form approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| by the Knox County Law Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9979)|
| 2:46:22| That is quite a disincentive to a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9982)|
| 2:46:25| who might previously have been including sidewalks routinely in their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9985)|
| 2:46:32| or in their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| I think it's a disincentive for them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| But I thought we just said when the sidewalk's built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| we own it and maintain it as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| So I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10001)|
| 2:46:42| What you read sounds like they have to maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| The homeowners do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10005)|
| 2:46:46| But you just said we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| This is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| If approved, everything that predates this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| I'm sorry, can you go to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10015)|
| 2:46:56| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| You're correct in both senses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| If this ordinance is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| everything from the enactment of this ordinance forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| if sidewalks are installed per the developer's discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10026)|
| 2:47:11| the HOAs would maintain those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| Everything that predates that would still not have the weight of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10034)|
| 2:47:18| and we would maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| So if a new development gets built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| sidewalks are involved, they maintain them inside so that our resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10041)|
| 2:47:26| I believe would the intent be that our resources are then used to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10046)|
| 2:47:30| roads and neighborhoods and things together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10050)|
| 2:47:32| versus maintaining everything inside that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10055)|
| 2:47:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10056)|
| 2:47:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10057)|
| 2:47:38| Thank you for all that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| In this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| had you all thought about the way you have it listed here is that the five lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10068)|
| 2:47:57| should you have designated a certain number of lots for the commercial developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| and then a separate amount of lots for the residential developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10081)|
| 2:48:05| instead of grouping it together and saying either four is five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10085)|
| 2:48:11| We can take a look at that a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| Typically in commercial developments, a good portion of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10094)|
| 2:48:18| those are lots of record that are just being redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10098)|
| 2:48:22| The reason we chose five lots is that that's the requirement for what you would consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10102)|
| 2:48:28| MPC doesn't necessarily call it a major subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| but essentially if you have less than five lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| we felt like that was a pretty steep burden to ask someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10113)|
| 2:48:38| So that was kind of our thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| We don't care a bit to look at that a little closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| but that was kind of where we were with the selection of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| My questions have already been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10134)|
| 2:48:55| I've got a question or statement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| I know this meeting is awfully long in a tooth, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10139)|
| 2:49:03| but I guess my—I'm not sure if issue is the right word on this as I've looked back at it—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10143)|
| 2:49:10| is this quarter of a mile issue of, you know, when—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| I mean, that's really not very long of a distance if you're connecting people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| walkability to commercial nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| It was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10162)|
| 2:49:23| I got, like all of us, got quite a few emails on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| and I took a little bit of time as I was prepping for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10165)|
| 2:49:28| I called a few people and said, so tell me what you mean on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10168)|
| 2:49:31| And one of them, who is a mutual friend of Ms. Cooley's and I, Ed McAllister, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10171)|
| 2:49:38| so I said, well, Ed, tell me your take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10178)|
| 2:49:41| Because his—shouldn't be surprised that his email didn't make a lick of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10181)|
| 2:49:44| So I asked him about it, and he said, well, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10184)|
| 2:49:49| are you talking about sidewalks in the neighborhoods or just this whole connectivity thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| Because I think we all want to see more walkability within our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10193)|
| 2:50:01| to connect to things where they want to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10201)|
| 2:50:05| And I know that one of the intents of this is to mandate some of that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| And correct me if I'm wrong, in the past ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10209)|
| 2:50:13| the quarter mile or the front footage on a main road, there was never—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| was that firm that you had to add sidewalks to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10218)|
| 2:50:21| or was it the preexisting ordinance that it was mainly geared towards sidewalks inside neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10221)|
| 2:50:26| I just want to get that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| The wording in the minimum subdivision regs was a little vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10230)|
| 2:50:34| but primarily what we saw in practice, Chair, was sidewalks internal and not external.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10234)|
| 2:50:42| Okay. Okay. Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10242)|
| 2:50:44| My point is there's an awful lot of people out there who I think would like to see external sidewalks as much as the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10244)|
| 2:50:49| you know, we're talking sometimes perception in the public is we're talking about internal sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10249)|
| 2:50:55| and I don't think anybody even realized that we are—part of this is talking about the externals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10255)|
| 2:50:59| You know, where my issue with this is more so, you know, is it a half mile—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10259)|
| 2:51:05| and I'm thinking about, say, Westland Road, and there's some really cool stuff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| If you go towards the school out there, we've got a long stretch of sidewalks right off of Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10270)|
| 2:51:16| that goes beyond that quarter mile area as you're getting closer towards Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10276)|
| 2:51:21| And I'm just thinking of that as an example where everybody worked on it together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10281)|
| 2:51:25| and you had some extended sidewalks that were passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| Was that done by the developers out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| Or I don't know if we've got institutional memory of when those sidewalks were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10290)|
| 2:51:35| Where exactly on Westland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| If you're going—if you go down Westland, kind of out of my neighborhood, if you take a right—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10297)|
| 2:51:43| y'all don't know where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10303)|
| 2:51:44| But if you go down Westland and you are headed west, and then you hit Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10304)|
| 2:51:50| and you know how you take a left on Ebenezer and then you take a right on the next section of Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| kind of near Gettysview, and Westland Drive on the left, continuing to head west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10316)|
| 2:52:01| has got a really long stretch of a sidewalk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10321)|
| 2:52:04| which I know goes for more than a quarter of a mile past A.L. Lott's school down on that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10324)|
| 2:52:10| I'm sure that there are some mandates that you've got to do some connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10330)|
| 2:52:14| but my point is it stretches a lot farther than a quarter of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10334)|
| 2:52:18| and it's a very useful sidewalk there that, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10338)|
| 2:52:23| if there are similar areas in town that could grow into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| it would make a little bit more sense to consider these if they're—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10346)|
| 2:52:30| I mean, goodness, the front footage of a neighborhood is barely a quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| I mean, so I guess I'd like to see this apply maybe to folks who are a little bit farther out than just a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10354)|
| 2:52:42| In fact, I think Commissioner Daley had mentioned that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10362)|
| 2:52:46| And certainly that—the quarter mile actually came when we first started talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10366)|
| 2:52:52| We'd got some literature from Commissioner Green about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10372)|
| 2:52:56| so that was kind of where I guess they had originally started that discussion back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10376)|
| 2:53:01| like Ms. Cooley said, back when they considered that resolution or subdivision regulation request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10381)|
| 2:53:08| One thing I would like to add, and I don't mean to delay the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10388)|
| 2:53:12| but like, for instance, a good situation that we would like to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10392)|
| 2:53:18| and I think it's in Commissioner Anders' district, Spradlin Place subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10398)|
| 2:53:23| It is out off of Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| There is sidewalks that were supposed to be installed into that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| because that subdivision's in the PRZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10412)|
| 2:53:35| The developer has came to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10415)|
| 2:53:39| and is asking them to release him of that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10419)|
| 2:53:44| We don't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| What we instead want him to do is much akin to what we're asking this ordinance to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10426)|
| 2:53:52| If anybody's familiar with Pleasant Ridge Road, there's a—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10432)|
| 2:53:56| where Autumn Walk Apartments are, those folks have to walk down Pleasant Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10436)|
| 2:54:00| and then they have to cross at grade on Pleasant Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10440)|
| 2:54:04| which we think is very dangerous, and we want to eliminate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10444)|
| 2:54:07| So what we're asking Planning Commission staff to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10447)|
| 2:54:10| is kind of apply the, I guess, the scope of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| and ask the developer to install sidewalks from that terminus point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| where it currently crosses Pleasant Ridge all the way to the traffic signal at Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10458)|
| 2:54:24| That way people that are in Autumn Walk Apartments can walk all the way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10464)|
| 2:54:28| to the traffic signal and cross at a much safer point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| So I guess that's a good practical example of where we would like to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10471)|
| 2:54:36| install these sidewalks on these collector roadways external,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10476)|
| 2:54:41| and I think that could be something that we would also do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| in lieu of the developer installing along his frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| if it's way in the outskirts of the PRZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| we could ask him to potentially give us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10490)|
| 2:54:55| the commensurate amount of his sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| and we could go in and build those locations closer in that would benefit more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10498)|
| 2:55:02| So that's also something that's codified in this ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10502)|
| 2:55:05| So, you know, I appreciate Ms. Cooley's passion for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10505)|
| 2:55:10| I mean, I want safe pedestrian facilities too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| so I appreciate the fact that she brought some of these comments up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10514)|
| 2:55:17| but I just, sorry to delay the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| but I did want to get those couple of points across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| All right. Thank you, Jim. Mr. Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| I went to an opening of 52 affordable houses right off of Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10528)|
| 2:55:35| noticed that the driveways were combined with a shared driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| and there was no sidewalks in those 52 houses down that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10539)|
| 2:55:43| It goes down the street back down to Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10543)|
| 2:55:46| They did that because of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10546)|
| 2:55:49| When you put in sidewalks, concrete comes in different strengths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10549)|
| 2:55:54| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10554)|
| 2:55:56| Some concrete holds more weight, some doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10556)|
| 2:56:00| In our area out there, we had some on Emory Road, which was put in by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10560)|
| 2:56:07| Theirs held up to it, but when they went inside some of these subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10567)|
| 2:56:11| it did have sidewalks in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| They had the big utilities trucks drive up on those sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10573)|
| 2:56:17| which are not designed to hold weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10577)|
| 2:56:22| Now, if we put that on the HOAs in those subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10582)|
| 2:56:28| and those big utilities trucks break those sidewalks down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10588)|
| 2:56:34| then they're going to say, hey, we didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| That was utility work, and then we're going to have litigation going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| But it's done for, they do cheaper sidewalks in subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10599)|
| 2:56:44| because it's a cheap way to get out and hold their costs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10604)|
| 2:56:48| Who's going to check on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| How are we going to litigate against that if they use the wrong poundage concrete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10610)|
| 2:56:55| And what happens if utilities trucks breaks it down and they say, well, it wasn't us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10615)|
| 2:57:00| Then the HOAs have to go to litigate those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| So there's a lot of things happening with sidewalks for unforeseen consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10623)|
| 2:57:09| Before we really get into this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| how are we going to take care of those issues for the homeowners and the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10631)|
| 2:57:16| We haven't said anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10636)|
| 2:57:17| We want sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10637)|
| 2:57:18| Yeah, I want sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| But I only want to pay for them once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| I don't want to have to pay for them two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| So anyway, that's just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| Is there any additional discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10654)|
| 2:57:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10655)|
| 2:57:36| Remind me, Madam Clerk, it's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10656)|
| 2:57:39| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10659)|
| 2:57:40| It was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10660)|
| 2:57:41| Who made the motion and who made the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10661)|
| 2:57:44| It's been that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| All right, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10665)|
| 2:57:46| It's been that long, and it's a late night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10666)|
| 2:57:47| I think it was the motion from Commissioner Smith and the second from Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10670)|
| 2:57:51| I think that's, to clarify, that's where the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10671)|
| 2:57:54| The guy that asked who made the motion made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10676)|
| 2:57:57| Commissioner Jay, just real quickly, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| I think as we continue this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| as we continue this conversation both for our engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10684)|
| 2:58:08| and for our citizens that are passionate about sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10688)|
| 2:58:13| please bring some visuals, some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| Help us understand these opportunities where we can understand where engineering would like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10696)|
| 2:58:22| hey, let's make this a judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| Let's see a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| We all have neighborhoods and we all have districts or the entire county where we have examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10706)|
| 2:58:32| but I think it just helps to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| I live in a neighborhood that has no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10714)|
| 2:58:36| I feel perfectly safe walking up and down it, and we do quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| So everybody's going to have a different opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| but I really think it would be helpful for you to bring some of that to the next discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10725)|
| 2:58:46| Back to Commissioner Anders, then Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| I was just going to remind Dr. Cooley that it's first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| We'll have a public hearing, and I would hope that she'd come back and continue the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10732)|
| 2:58:57| This, I recall from earlier in the meeting, this is item 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10737)|
| 2:59:02| so we don't have to have a public hearing unless we wanted to schedule it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| Because it's not zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10745)|
| 2:59:06| Because it's not a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10746)|
| 2:59:07| Because it has a second reading, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10747)|
| 2:59:08| It has a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10748)|
| 2:59:09| It has a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10749)|
| 2:59:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10752)|
| 2:59:13| Back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10753)|
| 2:59:14| Yeah, I just want to follow up with Commissioner Anders' point that this is really a procedural vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10754)|
| 2:59:19| because the main vote is going to be in January, being the following the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10759)|
| 2:59:24| So if we all vote yes, it's not specifically saying that, you know, this is the final end end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10764)|
| 2:59:31| Because I think Mr. Stoden might have a chance to do some little adjusting here as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10771)|
| 2:59:36| if we, you know, work with him and have additional comments from the public as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10776)|
| 2:59:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10782)|
| 2:59:43| I want to agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| Commissioner Daley, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| Since we're going to be here on the 21st, why can't we have a public meeting then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10787)|
| 2:59:52| I think we could do a second public hearing after the work session on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10792)|
| 2:59:58| I mean, this is one of those things that we all are almost assuming that it's like a zoning thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| We kind of got to do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| We could do a public hearing that will take place after the public hearing, the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10804)|
| 3:00:11| We all know that the first public hearing, it might take all of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| This one could take a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| If they're interested, I would rather do it on work session than be here on a commission meeting until 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10817)|
| 3:00:24| All right. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10824)|
| 3:00:25| Let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10825)|
| 3:00:26| I'm going to schedule a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10826)|
| 3:00:29| We've already got that other public hearing, Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10829)|
| 3:00:32| That's going to take place at 7 o'clock or immediately following this public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10832)|
| 3:00:37| That'll be a quickie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10837)|
| 3:00:41| Let's have this one start at 7 o'clock or immediately following the first public hearing at the 21st work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10841)|
| 3:00:50| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10850)|
| 3:00:51| You want it at 7 as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| Well, the key thing is going to be immediately following the first hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10853)|
| 3:01:00| You could say 7 o'clock or immediately following the first hearing that we've scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10860)|
| 3:01:07| I think that is a really fair way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| We do need to have a vote on this one to move it forward to the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10869)|
| 3:01:14| There's a motion on the floor to move this to January for the real work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10874)|
| 3:01:20| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10880)|
| 3:01:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10885)|
| 3:01:26| This will move forward, and there's a lot of work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10886)|
| 3:01:28| Once again, I want to be clear in my feeling on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10888)|
| 3:01:30| I'm just not comfortable with that quarter-mile stuff, and there's a whole lot more that I want to drill down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10890)|
| 3:01:35| I may end up being a no vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10895)|
| 3:01:39| Anywho, finally, two things before we all run off for the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| Thing number one, we've had a really heavy agenda this month, so we've had so much energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10904)|
| 3:01:52| We haven't had a chance to tease out what we're going to talk about with the Knox County delegation at the January lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10912)|
| 3:01:59| Part of that's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10919)|
| 3:02:00| I didn't post it to the forum after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| We still had a whole lot of other stuff to work through, so I'll get that posted this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| We're going to need to drive that through the forum to pull together what we're going to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10926)|
| 3:02:10| And secondly, I want to say something about how really, frankly, proud I am of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10930)|
| 3:02:15| We had so many important things come before us tonight, and we all stayed focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| We listened to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10939)|
| 3:02:20| Everybody, I guess it kind of makes me very proud to serve with all of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10940)|
| 3:02:24| If you consider how late this meeting, I never, other than having to go to the facilities, nobody complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10944)|
| 3:02:30| And our attention to the public was just as good at the end of the meeting as it was at the very end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10950)|
| 3:02:37| And I just want to let you all know how proud I am to be serving with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10957)|
| 3:02:40| And have a happy holiday and Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10960)|
| 3:02:43| Give Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=10963)|
