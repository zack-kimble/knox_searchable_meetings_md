| 3069.56 | 3077.04 | Commissioner Beeler. Sure, thank you Madam Chair. The purpose of this really is to                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230821?start=3069.56)            |

| 3082.72 | 3088.36 | based on the discussion that came out of the joint workshop with council a couple                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230821?start=3082.7200000000003) |
| 3088.36 | 3094.12 | weeks ago. I think as the vice mayor stated that that night, perhaps others                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230821?start=3088.36)            |

| 3140.8  | 3146.56 | question for the sponsor. I mean it, we've talked about this for years. It's not a,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230821?start=3140.8)             |
| 3146.68 | 3156.68 | certainly not a new subject, but when does it get to a more specific ask? I mean, you know,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230821?start=3146.68)            |

| 3267.56 | 3271.6  | could be a county match or even a city match at this point, like this is a                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230821?start=3267.56)            |
