| 0:00:06| We have to have a forum to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=6)|
| 0:00:10| We have to have a forum to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=10)|
| 0:00:13| You're the only one but me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=13)|
| 0:00:15| Ethics committee only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=15)|
| 0:00:17| I didn't deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=17)|
| 0:00:18| Are there any additions or deletions from our agenda for August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=18)|
| 0:00:27| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| I'm Sheila Munzer with Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=28)|
| 0:00:31| And items 9 and 10 are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| It's community development block grant recovery funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=35)|
| 0:00:39| This is an application, annual action plan amendment that went to HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| and we need it on the agenda, but we just need it on one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=45)|
| 0:00:51| We'll take off number 10 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| Are there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| One thing that was a little bit confusing to a couple of people is number 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=60)|
| 0:01:07| consideration and resolution requesting KCDC to operate as a housing authority for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=67)|
| 0:01:13| and approving a public housing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| I think it's not confusing to those of us on the commission because from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| finance has met with each of us, and we understand that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| But the way it's written here, it doesn't really state totally what we talked about in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=88)|
| 0:01:37| It doesn't say we're merging them, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| But we haven't seen the detail yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| Perhaps when the detail appears, then we'll see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| What's confusing is it's written there, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| Of course, the details will come out when we get our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| Do you have a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| One thing on 43, get my mic down here, on number 43,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=124)|
| 0:02:15| rather than keep deferring that month after month, I can always bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| There is a meeting set for the August 27th to do at least part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| So I'm going to just withdraw that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| We can bring it back later if the 27th meeting doesn't address all of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=152)|
| 0:02:41| And number 43 will be withdrawn from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| Are there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| Anything from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Is there any detail on item 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=175)|
| 0:03:11| Maybe Mr. Nance can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| He's sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| He got the backup information for that particular tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| So he can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=207)|

| 0:03:54| I didn't know if there was any detail up yet about this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| It just caught my eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Well, some of these don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Some of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| But that one is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090805agendameeting?start=240)|
