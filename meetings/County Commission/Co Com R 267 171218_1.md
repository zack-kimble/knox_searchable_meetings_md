| 2:18:41| On| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| that same day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| finance meeting at 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| Which means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| we could have this at 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| or we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| the finance meeting at 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| and the public hearing at 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| or we could go to the next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| day meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| That's on a Tuesday also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| It's a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| The commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| means that's a normal time but the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| assembly is only open 8 to 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| We'd only have 8 to 1.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| on that Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| Mr. Law Director, can we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| is this where it has to be read in consecutive meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| or can it be read a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| then February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| It just has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| two readings with a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| I don't think it's much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| of a public meeting if you have it at 2 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| and nobody can show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| I would move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| to do it at the work session in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| if that's not conflicted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| The chairman's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| I would agree we could have a date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| sometime in February and have the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| reading in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| Is that all we need to come to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| Is everybody okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8409)|
| 2:20:15| Okay, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| Discussion regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| Charter Review Committee size and makeup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| Because we do have a few months that we can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| on this. As I pointed out at our last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| meeting that there was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| question to the number of the size of the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| something that we would need to get resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| before this next election cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| that it would be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| whenever Charter Review does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| meet in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| Right now, I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| going to ask you guys to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| If you know anybody that served on Charter Review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| get their opinion on it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| talk to anybody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| had anything to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| what they think the formula is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| It may be best just to leave it the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| but I wanted to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| Anybody have anything on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| Mr. Chairman, I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| You and I were on that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| and it was rather large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| and all the chairs were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| filled and people were sitting at tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| and still some seated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| I would think that we'll probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| run into some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| difficulty getting it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| Name the makeup again. It's nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| It's nine commissioners from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| districts. Each commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| appoints one person from their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| and then the mayor appoints nine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| From a district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| Did the mayors have to come from a district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| I think they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| The problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| that I would see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| nine commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| need to be on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| and then if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| you say you're going to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| nine commissioners, it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| to be difficult to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| these other people who they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| going to cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| I think we should still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| discuss it. I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| bring forth what I thought might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| happen, the contention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| we might arrive at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| It's something to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| not anticipate the size of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| being reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| I agree with you. I think that you do not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| the majority of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| to be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| I think you're better served by this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| if there is more influence from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| community than from those with political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| Okay. Anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| Next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. What kind of time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| are we going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| looking at to further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| the discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| We need to have something to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| law department by May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8579)|
| 2:23:11| Discussion regarding DUI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| litter pickup crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| I think we can just pass this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| Discussion regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| emails that come through the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| office. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| Two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| One, when we receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| emails that come in that are addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| to commission at KnoxCounty.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| if you'll notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| in the last four or five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| the caption's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| changed so you know it's been coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| into that website. It says commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| email colon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| and then what the title of the email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| is. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| were specifically coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| to the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| website. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| other emails, as you know, we get from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| Drew that says the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| or Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| or whatever department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| we get a general email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| that's pretty much from internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| inside Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| The whole idea was to differentiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| the two. Now the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| second part of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| email that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| is when they're directed to all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| how do all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| of us know that that email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| was answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| suggestion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| think the thing to do is if you respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| to an email, go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| the commission forum and post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| what you responded on there. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| that's probably the easiest way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| The public's not going to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| Or you can reply all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| You can send it to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| Respond to the email to that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| but then post on the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| to let us know that you responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| and what you responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| If it's an item that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| we're never going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| during a commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| does it make sense to just then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| if, say, Commissioner Thomas knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| the answer to that question, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| replies all so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| gain that same knowledge that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| has regarding that and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| not violating any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| of sunshine rules. Or if Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| Wright or Commissioner Anders has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| the answer to that, it'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| nice that all of us know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| information and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| that we know the public was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| responded to. Well, I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| if somebody does have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| codes or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| Anything, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| And somebody responds, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| but in that case, you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| copy everybody on it because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| not something that we're deliberating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| But we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| currently not doing that, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| you know, are the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| getting an answer to their emails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| And it goes back to something we discussed earlier in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| Some of us are worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| violating the Sunshine Act by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| hitting reply all. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| I have heard that discussed. Now, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| hit reply all, have we violated the Sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| Act because this is a . . . Depends on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| It depends on the question. So, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| may be something we just need some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| clarification on because there are issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| we vote on and then there's customer service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| issues. I meant to tell you all this earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| back on the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| I plan on meeting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| Judge Pranzler after the first of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| to sit down because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| none of us went through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| So, we probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| don't have the perspective that he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| on it to be able to . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| I'm hoping he can give me some guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| on what his . . . You know, he's the man that wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| He should be able to give me what his intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| But back to yours. Yeah, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| also think it could be an educational opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| for all of us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| particularly if, say, Mr. Nystrom knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| something because he's next door to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| on a particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| He can let everybody know, hey, this is what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| going on and that's why the equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| was out on North Shore and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| whatever intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| and then we know that a new building's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| going up or whatever. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| think that we need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| that the citizen is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| responded to. And right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| now, when they come in . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| And I'm not speaking of these zoning issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| because we understand that's an entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| different ballgame there, but anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| that comes in, we need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| that, hey, the citizen was taken care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| of. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| to me, it should be a reply all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| if you know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| And the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| not something that would be . . . Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| Or . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Reply all and then post your answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| on the forum. That way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| you reply all and the citizens know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| the reply was. That way it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| is public knowledge then and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| not like hidden from . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| like you all are communicating only with yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| Or you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| could answer to that one and post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| your answer on the forum and not reply all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| question . . . suggestion. My eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| aren't good. I was just seeing if Dick is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| here, but I think I see . . . Yeah, the IT staff is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| Okay, IT is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| One thing that might make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| just one step easier could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| if there is a . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| And I'm not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| that some commissioners may . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| We may be busy. We may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| respond to something and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| it's another step where you cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| and paste and put your response in the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| I'm wondering if there is a . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| I'm not sure the right word. A dummy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| email that can be maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| response at county commission that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| can loop in when we hit a reply all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| We copy a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| email that could . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| Any emails that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| this address receives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| are automatically posted in the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| That might be a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| kind of make it one step. You know, if you're going to hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| reply all, you're going to hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| response at county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| and then someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| behind the scenes, it could be some of our admin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| folks, will automatically take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| response and drop it into the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| so that it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| public. And that's just trying to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| a little bit more simple because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| county commissioners may be moving and responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| quick. You could be responding on your phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| and you may not have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| while you can add in an email address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| going into the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| that's an extra step that might make it a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| more simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| It looks like . . . Is Dick making his way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| to the front? He's leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| Thank you. Or is he leaving the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| No, he wanted to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| Dick Moran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| IT department. I get to follow the beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8981)|

| 2:29:45| I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| point out that the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| email are not linked together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| So it's going to have to be a manual process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| of some kind. But we'll be glad to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| Whatever you all want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| we'll be glad to support it and make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| Well, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| I think it just needs to be the easiest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| process and the citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| is being responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| It's the goal of all of this. Or we could just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| make it that the at-large commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| respond to all the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9021)|

| 2:30:25| to beat a horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| They have an extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| email cc'd and it could either be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| IT or it could be our admin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| The purpose of that is just to make sure those things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| public record and that everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9035)|

| 2:30:39| what we replied all to. If it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| we're not debating about, it's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9041)|

| 2:30:45| that something's been dealt with. And then if we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| make sure that that's public record or easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| to find public record, you add in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| a response at county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| commission and then it's behind the scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| and it could be our admin that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| checks that email occasionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| or IT. Somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| it just automatically, we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| that stuff gets posted in the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| Commissioner Gill. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| Chairman. How difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| would it be to just simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| contact the person who sent the email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| to figure out which district it goes to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| You don't want to make it difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| I'm going to go to Dave first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| Well, go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| and address her question since it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9089)|
| 2:31:33| Let's discuss that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| It would be as hard as somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| replying to it and asking where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| that would be from Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9103)|
| 2:31:49| Commissioner Wright. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| I was actually going to muddy the water and change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| the subject. Still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| about commission email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| Let me refer to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| personal account at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| I get emails and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| every three or four days, I begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| to get more emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| from unknown people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| they're just advertisements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| or you've been added to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| someone's email list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| I think that's happening to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| in the world of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| that we're on email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| lists of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| that just send us one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| and maybe we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| of how do we determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| some email list that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| we may be on. We don't really need their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| emails. And you know how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| unsubscribe then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| You're saying we need to form a committee, an email committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| And every quarter or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| go through the list and say let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| unsubscribe. That's not a bad idea, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| I would be happy with anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| saying that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| unsubscribe to half a dozen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9173)|

| 2:41:33| that recommendation to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| for basically two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| reasons. One being that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| there is other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| C.A. zoned property, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9701)|

| 2:42:53| property that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9773)|

| 2:42:57| commercial zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9777)|
| 2:42:59| As far as access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| property, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9781)|
| 2:43:03| two median cuts as shown on the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9783)|

| 2:43:11| corner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| we feel access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| would not be limited to just Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| Road, that there could be strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| access from Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9803)|

| 2:43:27| We would stay away from the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| The property fronts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| on Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9813)|

| 2:43:41| So, access points at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| good distance from the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9823)|

| 2:43:51| as far as the CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| zoning, why we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| pick this property to hold it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9835)|

| 2:45:39| MPC has stated that the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| access would be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9941)|

| 2:45:49| It's questionable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| whether or not this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| extends all the way to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| it would line up with the median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| There is potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| if the larger property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9959)|

| 2:46:03| of a larger piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| property, if it were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| develop at some point in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| future, or I shouldn't say it's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| of a larger piece of property, there's other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| property there that's primed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| development, and you can anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| the same type of request probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| On KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9981)|

| 2:46:25| It has a median cut there, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| got a driveway on to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| Well, that's for a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| Oh, I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| But a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| is a driveway according to TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| Well, then why was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| specified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| I guess I'd like to hear from the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| before I have any more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| The driveway was there long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| before as a four-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10011)|

| 2:47:11| years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| and I support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| MPC's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| hesitantly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| overlay this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| or to give the OB zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| and the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| I've driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| Thompson Road for 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| plus years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| and I think I might shed some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| light on the confusion about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| access. This is a residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| that is kind of at the corner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| Thompson and Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| There's a pretty good, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| a TDOT or a county right-of-way buffer there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| very wide for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| ingress and egress to Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| But a number of years ago, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| two to three, there was a tenant in that house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| that was running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| an illegal business, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| against the zoning, that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| He was running a commercial business out of the agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| zoning and he cut a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| across the low side of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| property onto Thompson Road, about 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| feet from Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| You can see it from the cages. It looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| like a dirt road and that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| To my knowledge, there was never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| a driveway permit issued for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| It is an unsafe situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| If you turn right off of Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| onto Thompson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| and there's any traffic coming in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| of that drive, it's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| I have additional safety concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| the line of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10109)|

| 2:48:33| backing traffic up right there to turn into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| Nevertheless, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| still hesitantly support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| the MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| To my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| there's been no specified intended use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10125)|

| 2:48:49| I heard the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10129)|

| 2:48:53| a restaurant there, they bought it from family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| they might develop it, they might do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| The bigger picture is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10137)|

| 2:49:25| barely safe for a school bus to navigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10165)|

| 2:49:29| but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| have a lot of concerns about having commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10171)|

| 2:50:01| The cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10201)|

| 2:50:15| on Thompson Road is dismal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| and it would not support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| commercial access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| I endorse what the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| planners have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| and thoroughly endorse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10227)|

| 2:50:35| just a second, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10235)|
| 2:50:41| The access on Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10241)|
| 2:50:43| Road that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| on the map, that's not the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10245)|
| 2:50:47| driveway that you use, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| That guy drew that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| He just took his bush hog and cut down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| It looks like that's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| I don't know if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| Has he submitted a site plan to NPC at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| Sorry, you haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| the access that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| you don't have permission of right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| on Thompson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| correct? No or yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| We have not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| We have no plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| yet, but I would tell you that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| design efforts were made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| given the fact that there's 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| and I think it was 340 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| of depth back from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| interchange, access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| onto Thompson Road would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| feasible, but it would be at the far south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| corner of the property. As the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10295)|

| 2:51:43| also, and as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10303)|
| 2:51:45| that drive that was cut in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10305)|

| 2:52:11| off Thompson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10331)|

| 2:52:15| is that correct? Correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10335)|

| 2:52:29| Hardin Valley, there is a dental office over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| Okay, so they're like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| medical offices and other offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10353)|

| 2:53:25| Hardin Valley, as we all know, is changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| And I would ask that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| give us this consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| especially given the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| there are other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10415)|

| 2:54:41| down Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| So, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| the OB was looked as a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| Again, as you stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| the uses across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10491)|
| 2:54:53| are already office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| The property to the east of it is zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| However, it's extremely steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10497)|
| 2:55:00| and comes down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| So, it would take a significant amount of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| to get it ready to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| As we stated, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| there's eight parcels east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| of our parcel that are already zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| And that's just within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| 3,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10520)|
| 2:55:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10529)|
| 2:55:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| I think the difference in this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| of property that gives us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10543)|
| 2:55:45| a little bit of hesitancy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| these other parcels don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| a small residential road that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| they're affecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10551)|
| 2:55:55| I'm scrolling down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| I don't see a single one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| that has a residential road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| that they're affecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| So, I think that kind of changes this lot a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| What about that zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| that MPC is requesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10567)|
| 2:56:11| That general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| that CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| that opens you up to a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| The traffic there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10577)|
| 2:56:19| gives people apprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| Especially, you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| your access is going to be farther down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| to the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| and not down on Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| near Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| So, I think it gives us an apprehension there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| a little bit about what could go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10593)|
| 2:56:35| and what traffic it brings to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| Well, by bringing our access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| further south on Thompson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| one, helps with stacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| issues going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| It would minimize those type of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| Therefore, less traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| at our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| So, that's more of a safety thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| That's going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10613)|
| 2:56:57| And the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| immediately to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| fronts on Thompson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| I would ask that you consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| why is my client being treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| any differently than that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10629)|
| 2:57:15| Mr. Kelly, how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10635)|
| 2:57:17| has that property been zoned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| adjoining property to the east?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| suspect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| probably Winston Cox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| probably got that done at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| or shortly around the time that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| developed the subdivision there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| just to the south of it, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| sometime in the 90s, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| If you were going to pick a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| where you wanted to halt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| on Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| would Thompson School not be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| point that anything to the west would remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| One of the other things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| you've got to think about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10683)|
| 2:58:07| given the situation out on Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| Valley right now with the traffic that's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| out there, if you start adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| a significant amount of commercial traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| whereas the office uses generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| significantly less traffic generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| than a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| if and when the situation is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| fixed out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| there may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| a good argument for looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| at CA zoning for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| or commercial zoning. I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| It would probably be better if the entire track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| that larger track, came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| and we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| planned commercial or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10725)|
| 2:58:47| on that so that we could get a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10727)|
| 2:58:49| and potentially even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| tie it in with the Iron Gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| construction that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| and other alternatives out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| Looking at just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| small track is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| not the way you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| planning for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10743)|
| 2:59:09| Again, I'm kind of confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| We're talking about the impacts of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| off of a two acre site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| but at the same time we're talking if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| incorporated the larger track next to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| would that not generate even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| traffic? And then I would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| you to consider that an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| zoning is going to generate traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| more during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| time hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| when the traffic is heavy on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| My office is the OA track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| just east of Reagan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| I know what the traffic's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| like out there. And in the evenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| when prime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| restaurant use would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| it's not that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| Looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| the mapping, Mr. Anders, I also noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| that the CA track just to the northeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| of our site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| corners on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| Reagan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10797)|
| 2:59:59| Reagan Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| is very comparable to Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| How wide of a road is Thompson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| Probably not greater than 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| And the reason I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| that is it used to be a whole lot less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| than that. And when they developed those subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| back up in there, there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| improvements that were done that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| raised it up to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| There are sections of Thompson Road that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| all the way over to Lowell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| that are probably 14 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10835)|
| 3:00:37| I agree wholeheartedly. There is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| further south on Thompson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| it does get extremely narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| But once again, that's also going to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| as a restricting factor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| traffic until that is improved upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10847)|
| 3:00:59| Would planned commercial not work here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| so it could be site reviewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| The track is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| really too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| You have to have a 50 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| setback all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| You take 50 feet out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| of a two acre track all the way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| you've lost a lot of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| Another thing as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| more chance for review. This property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| does lie in the technology overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| so we will have to go before TTCDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| There will be plenty of opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| for additional review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| for any type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| Could I ask Mr. Snowden a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| Jim, could I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10899)|
| 3:01:45| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| If this were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| as he's asked and they added traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| would they be required to make Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| improve Thompson all the way down to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| intersection at all or would it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10917)|
| 3:01:59| a requirement upon the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| that causes the change in traffic to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| Depending on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| use and the trips generated, a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| study would look at that. They might have to put a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| right or left. Right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| Thompson Road is just a two lane exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| They might have to put a right turn lane in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| That would be determined in a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| What traffic count number would trigger that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| 750 trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| would generate a level one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10941)|
| 3:02:23| traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10943)|
| 3:02:25| But if we don't know what's going there, we don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10945)|
| 3:02:27| they're going to trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| But if he triggers 750, it has to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10949)|
| 3:02:31| traffic study and they'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10951)|
| 3:02:33| required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10955)|
| 3:02:57| Mr. Kelly, did the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10977)|
| 3:02:59| Planning Commission ever consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10979)|
| 3:03:01| I know they did office at 14-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| Was there a vote on the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| So it came from staff as office and they voted on office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10987)|
| 3:03:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10989)|
| 3:03:15| Did the applicant agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10995)|
| 3:03:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| No, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=10999)|
| 3:03:21| Moorman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| was at the meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| made the same arguments that he's making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11005)|
| 3:03:33| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11015)|
| 3:03:37| Mr. Kelly, in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| staff report, were you reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| from a report or were you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11021)|
| 3:03:43| just highlighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| some of the things in it? Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11025)|
| 3:03:47| the verbiage that I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11027)|
| 3:03:49| was as relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| to the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11031)|
| 3:03:53| the staff may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| have said there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| vacant property of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| I thought I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| that there's vacant commercially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| zoned property in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| that probably would meet the demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| for commercial zoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11047)|
| 3:04:09| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11049)|
| 3:04:11| And what were they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| The OB zone does give them a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11053)|
| 3:04:15| use of the property. We recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| attractiveness for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| use is probably about zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| So from that standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| what are the alternatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11067)|
| 3:04:29| And we landed on office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| The Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| endorsed that recommendation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| sent that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| What were some other reasons other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| that there was an excess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| that zoning already available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| The access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| typically has businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| which operate past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| normal hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| And again, Thompson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| is a residential street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| You would anticipate commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| traffic and they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| potentially attempt to traverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| Thompson Road at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| which is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| other uses, other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| office uses that you're finding in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| are primarily medical in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| and there seems to be a pretty good market for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| is a significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| fast-growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| and as you go further out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| Hardin Valley, so I would anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| that some type of medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| office could very easily be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| at that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| The reason I asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| I heard you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11143)|
| 3:05:45| give the staff report and I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| what I was hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11151)|
| 3:05:53| disagree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| maybe I need to give a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11155)|
| 3:05:57| of reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| This particular owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| has one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| and if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| are a kabillion other pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| of property around just like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| and they're not being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| that might be a reason for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11171)|
| 3:06:13| owner of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| not to go in that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| But I don't think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11177)|
| 3:06:19| the government's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| to say which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| business you ought to go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11183)|
| 3:06:25| because there are other people out here that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| failing at what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| If they wish to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11189)|
| 3:06:33| it should be based on their wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| not based on the fact that other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| people are sitting there with the same zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| but not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| successful with their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| That does not fit within my idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11205)|
| 3:06:47| of capitalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| When I hear you're speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11209)|
| 3:06:51| to traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| at night and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| you've given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| you've put more things on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| Well, there are a number of reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11221)|
| 3:07:03| and this is a debatable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11225)|
| 3:07:07| There are a number of reasons that you could vote either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| What's happened here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| is the Planning Commission has made a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| to you for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| and you certainly can weigh that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11235)|
| 3:07:17| and choose to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| whatever feels appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11239)|
| 3:07:23| How much available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| office space is available out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11249)|
| 3:07:35| Mr. Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| don't typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| use office as a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| between commercial and residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| Since you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| LDR across from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| Thompson Road, does that not make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| the logical sense that that parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11271)|
| 3:07:53| should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11275)|
| 3:07:59| It's commercial in front of it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11281)|
| 3:08:05| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11285)|
| 3:08:11| Looking at this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| and you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| to, I guess that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11295)|
| 3:08:19| get my directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| right across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| from Thompson Road, there is one right on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| Hardin Valley there, you can just barely see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| in the corner there, that's CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| and that's right beside this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| And I see everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| else down through here that's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| on the Hardin Valley drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11325)|
| 3:08:47| This looks like it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| developing into CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| and I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11331)|
| 3:08:53| what you can get on a two acre track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| that would generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| a lot of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| but if it's an evening type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11339)|
| 3:09:01| business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11341)|
| 3:09:05| that would cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11345)|
| 3:09:07| down a little bit of the traffic that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| that an office would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| generate during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| MPC given an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11357)|
| 3:09:19| between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11359)|
| 3:09:21| the, to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| as CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| or OB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| Were they given that option to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| Mr. Kelly. Well, they're given the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11369)|
| 3:09:31| option as you're given this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11371)|
| 3:09:33| The applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| applied for CA and general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| designation on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11377)|
| 3:09:39| sector plan, the planning commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| made a recommendation to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| they heard the evidence from both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| planning commission staff and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| and made a decision and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11389)|
| 3:09:51| how they came to that. So from that standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| yes, they had the CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| and the general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11395)|
| 3:09:57| designation in front of them that they could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11397)|
| 3:09:59| acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| So what you're saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| it was written up as OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| presented to the MPC committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| and said you can either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| and made the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| more for OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11411)|
| 3:10:13| but like I said, I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11413)|
| 3:10:15| decide in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| what would be the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| use of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11419)|
| 3:10:21| property if we did OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| and we lend it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| OB to this individual that bought the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| property and it was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11429)|
| 3:10:31| there's the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| option would be to have to come back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| rezone it because he couldn't get the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| that he wanted out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| And I'm kind of torn between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| that. Were you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| were you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| when a person suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11445)|
| 3:10:47| for that, shouldn't we try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| to accommodate that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11449)|
| 3:10:51| if it fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11451)|
| 3:10:53| because that's his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| to see if that can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11455)|
| 3:10:57| and maybe more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| gear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11459)|
| 3:11:01| that argument toward what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11461)|

| 3:11:07| right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11467)|

| 3:11:25| on that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| Yes or no? Probably yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11487)|

| 3:11:31| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11491)|
| 3:11:33| I would like to add there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11493)|
| 3:11:35| some discussion about office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| medical office in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| if you look at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| just west of Cherivoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| Road in between there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| Pellissippi Parkway there is a medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11505)|
| 3:11:47| office building that was just constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| in the last, they just opened it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| last month and that's in a CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| zone so by zoning this CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11513)|
| 3:11:55| we're not restricting the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| for it to be developed as office if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| someone so chose. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| if we go with OB we've eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| the opportunity for my client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| to develop a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| Just wanted to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| was given consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11531)|
| 3:12:19| If I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| Mr. Chair, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| conflicted in the point that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| Thompson is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11545)|
| 3:12:27| insufficient for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| what traffic this might bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| but also every argument that we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11551)|
| 3:12:33| is we look at the map and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| every argument that I've heard tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| is right down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| street from it and so I struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| with that. Is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| fair for us to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| at the map and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| you can't have this but your neighbor's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11569)|
| 3:12:53| That's my only struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11573)|
| 3:12:57| Thompson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| I feel would need to be improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| to have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| traffic on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11583)|
| 3:13:05| But I'm not so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| sure that are we being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| consistent if you look at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11589)|
| 3:13:11| we're certainly not being consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11591)|
| 3:13:13| with denying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| That's my struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11595)|
| 3:13:23| As I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| it is in the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| overlay so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| the struggle with Thompson Road would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11609)|
| 3:13:31| addressed at the time development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| come to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| Technology Corridor doesn't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11615)|
| 3:13:37| traffic studies. They do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| structure. They don't do traffic studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| but they do regulate drive access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| and what not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| It's more architectural and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| I've sat on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| I know but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| more aesthetics than it is anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| My struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| is that every argument I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| against this, look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| the zoning map and it's unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11639)|
| 3:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11645)|

| 3:14:11| I need some help in understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11651)|

| 3:14:17| multicolored and purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| I see your site location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| What is across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| in the purple section that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| the, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| That's Business Park and it takes a large property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| to obtain that type of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| It is commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| as well. That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11673)|
| 3:14:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11675)|

| 3:14:45| That's BP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11687)|

| 3:14:51| That's where the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| business park is located off of Terra Hala Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| And it is on BP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| and technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| is a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11701)|
| 3:15:03| change and if we were going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11703)|
| 3:15:05| any zoning we would have to send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| with a different sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11709)|
| 3:15:11| I'm just going to throw this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| out there to get this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| I make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| send this back to MPC with a sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11717)|
| 3:15:19| change to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11719)|
| 3:15:21| General commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| General commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11725)|
| 3:15:31| Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| You're correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| that if you do something different than MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| initiated then you need to send it back for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| MPC and the language that we normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| use for that is for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11741)|
| 3:15:43| to initiate a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11743)|
| 3:15:45| And in this case it would be from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| park to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| GC. General commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11751)|
| 3:15:53| If I understand you correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| I would like to change my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| if the second is okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11759)|
| 3:16:01| State that again please Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| The way I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| the motion is that the county commission desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| to initiate a sector plan amendment from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11767)|
| 3:16:09| TP technology park to general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| commercial and send that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| MPC for its consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11775)|
| 3:16:21| I make that motion. Is everybody clear on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| So essentially what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| is that we couldn't change it tonight anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| We could either vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11789)|
| 3:16:33| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11793)|
| 3:16:35| I just want to question to Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11795)|
| 3:16:39| What is this Arbor Gate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11799)|
| 3:16:41| Is that the name of the road in the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11801)|
| 3:16:43| behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| Thompson Road there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11805)|
| 3:16:47| In the zoning and the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| there's no road going down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| to Thompson Road but in the aerial map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11813)|
| 3:16:55| there's a road that's now built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11815)|
| 3:16:57| from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| residential area down to Thompson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11821)|
| 3:17:03| looks like it's through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11823)|
| 3:17:05| the piece of property that's between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| the residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| and Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11829)|
| 3:17:11| Is that owned by the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| people and it's not going to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11833)|
| 3:17:15| now that that road's through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11835)|
| 3:17:17| the middle of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11837)|
| 3:17:19| I'm going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11839)|
| 3:17:21| go from memory here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| The subdivision was originally approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11843)|
| 3:17:25| It seemed like there was a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11845)|
| 3:17:27| back up in this area about where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| Arbor Gate Lane is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| right now and the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| snaked its way down through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| that fronts on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| That's my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| I don't think it's a road per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11861)|
| 3:17:45| It looks like a road connecting to Thompson on the aerial map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11865)|
| 3:17:49| It was an access drive to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11869)|
| 3:17:51| residence back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11871)|
| 3:17:53| prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11873)|
| 3:17:55| the development of the subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| It does not tie to the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11877)|
| 3:17:59| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| This road right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| is not on the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11885)|
| 3:18:07| so if this is CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| it seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| there's a road on the aerial map that goes right through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| It looks like it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11893)|
| 3:18:15| a pretty good road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| You are correct. It's a concrete driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| It was a gated drive for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| pretty large residence at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| It was up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11903)|
| 3:18:25| It's not used at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11905)|
| 3:18:27| It's not currently being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11907)|
| 3:18:29| It's one of the CA properties that are not developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11909)|
| 3:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11911)|
| 3:18:45| Sir, could you please speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| We can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11927)|
| 3:18:49| We do see traffic on that driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| pretty regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| You noted that it looks like a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11933)|
| 3:18:55| but it is a concrete drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| and it goes up to the residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| that I guess was the original property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| where the subdivision was developed around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11941)|
| 3:19:03| And it still appears to be a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11943)|
| 3:19:05| I don't know if it's occupied. I assume that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| But we do see traffic up and down that driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| fairly frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11949)|
| 3:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11957)|
| 3:19:23| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| If I misspoke, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| There was a residence at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| It may still be a single family residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| that that is serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| Okay. The road I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| looks like it's connected to Wellington Chase Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| and goes right into that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11979)|
| 3:19:43| The developer of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| bought that house at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11985)|
| 3:19:49| When he bought the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11989)|
| 3:19:51| then he moved into that house at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=11991)|
| 3:20:07| Do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| Okay. The motion before us is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12009)|

| 3:21:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| Can we explain that to the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| that are in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| What happens is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| MPC will go back and consider the sector plan again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| so it will come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12089)|

| 3:21:47| It will probably be on MPC's February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| agenda so it will be back here in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12109)|

| 3:27:47| the properties particularly along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| the frontage of Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12469)|
| 3:27:51| are important properties to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| the development of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| the Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12475)|

| 3:27:59| that are located out through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12479)|
| 3:28:01| I believe rezoning this property in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12481)|
| 3:28:03| general area would be a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12483)|
| 3:28:05| to change from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| Technology Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12487)|

| 3:28:11| use in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| One of the things that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| potentially occur if this property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12495)|
| 3:28:17| rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| and residential development occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12499)|
| 3:28:21| in the area, one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| you've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| this argument before, once you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| approve something and it gets built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| out, the next thing you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| the people are here opposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| what's going to go on next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| to them. In this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12515)|
| 3:28:37| there is anticipation that there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12517)|
| 3:28:39| other businesses that would be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| in the area given the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| zoning of the property and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| to a certain degree you're creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| opposition to future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12529)|
| 3:28:53| Probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12533)|
| 3:28:59| most important thing, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| two most important things. One is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| the sector plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12543)|
| 3:29:05| just updated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| 2016. There has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| been no discussion or there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| discussion of changing the property at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| and there has been no change in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| that would warrant changing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| sector plan just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12559)|
| 3:29:21| somebody is now asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12561)|
| 3:29:23| And then thirdly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12565)|
| 3:29:27| there is a lack of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12567)|
| 3:29:29| mainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12569)|
| 3:29:31| for access and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| what the opposition would say is the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12573)|
| 3:29:35| they haven't been able to sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12575)|
| 3:29:37| for BP use is primarily because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12577)|
| 3:29:39| of the poor access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| At this point the county is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| pursuing doing improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12583)|
| 3:29:45| to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12585)|
| 3:29:47| to Cherahala Drive and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| potential improvements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| the state is looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12591)|
| 3:29:53| an overall plan now for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12593)|
| 3:29:55| improvement of the Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| which in the future would most likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| include a closure of Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| Road, but at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| present it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12603)|
| 3:30:05| dangerous situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12605)|
| 3:30:07| that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| addressed before development occurs in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| Sir, how many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| did we change the sector plan tonight in that sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12613)|
| 3:30:17| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12617)|
| 3:30:19| About every one of the plan amendments have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12619)|
| 3:30:21| dealt with in that area. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12621)|
| 3:30:25| Would the applicant please speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12625)|
| 3:30:29| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to try to be very brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12629)|

| 3:30:35| to speak. I'm here on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12635)|
| 3:30:37| Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| I would like to introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12639)|
| 3:30:41| before we get started the ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12641)|
| 3:30:43| group that is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| I think, would you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| please stand just for a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| Anybody that has any ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12649)|
| 3:30:51| in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12651)|
| 3:30:53| This property, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12653)|
| 3:30:55| are a number of other owners, Mr. Fain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12655)|
| 3:30:57| who are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12657)|
| 3:30:59| We are here, you all can sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12659)|
| 3:31:01| we are here asking for a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12661)|
| 3:31:03| for low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12663)|
| 3:31:05| residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12665)|
| 3:31:07| rezoning at 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| The property has a long history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| I'm going to refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| to Mr. Fain as sort of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12675)|
| 3:31:17| organizer of the group, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12677)|
| 3:31:19| it was done prior to him, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12679)|
| 3:31:21| But this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| has owned this property since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| 1976.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| At that time it was zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| planned residential for up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12689)|
| 3:31:31| to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| In 1985| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| at the behest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12695)|
| 3:31:37| of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12697)|
| 3:31:39| this ownership group was convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| that this property could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| as a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| park. Since then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12707)|
| 3:31:49| nothing has happened to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12709)|
| 3:31:51| and we're over 30 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12711)|
| 3:31:53| They have tried to get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| to develop this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| as a business park and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| it simply has not occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12719)|
| 3:32:01| And I think the explanation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12721)|
| 3:32:03| not only the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12723)|
| 3:32:05| but the Knox County Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| Development Board owns a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| considerable amount of property in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12729)|
| 3:32:11| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12731)|
| 3:32:13| its mission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| to create jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12735)|
| 3:32:17| in Knox County. It negotiates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12737)|
| 3:32:19| with potential businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12739)|
| 3:32:21| and sells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12741)|
| 3:32:23| property at low market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| prices to entice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| businesses to come in here. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| criticizing it. I think that's great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12749)|
| 3:32:31| and they've done a good job. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12751)|
| 3:32:33| these are private owners. They have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| unable to sell this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12755)|
| 3:32:37| property for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12757)|
| 3:32:39| a business park as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12759)|
| 3:32:41| is zoned. Now they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12761)|
| 3:32:43| to go back and take the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=12763)|

| 3:37:57| of meetings in the last six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13077)|
| 3:37:59| to voice our opposition to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| appeal that Mr. Biddle is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13081)|

| 3:38:07| a dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13087)|
| 3:38:09| Even Mr. Seymour said at the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| MPC meeting, and this is a quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13091)|

| 3:38:43| more accidents. On this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13123)|

| 3:38:47| reported accidents in the last 11 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| and probably many more that are unreported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| Are these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| homes worth people's property and lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| We have listed all of our concerns over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13135)|

| 3:39:05| just the voice of another developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| This is getting personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13147)|
| 3:39:09| because many people are making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13149)|
| 3:39:11| on our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13151)|

| 3:39:15| who bought this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13155)|

| 3:39:21| They've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13161)|
| 3:39:23| that land for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| and they have sold land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| in that area and they have land across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13167)|

| 3:39:31| they will have the possibility of selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13171)|
| 3:39:33| that, which maybe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13173)|
| 3:39:35| roads are better over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13175)|

| 3:39:41| but they don't live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13181)|
| 3:39:43| there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13183)|
| 3:39:45| You people who are making this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| you do not live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| We will be the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| to deal with the aftermath because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| we do live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13193)|
| 3:39:55| The County Commission does not listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13195)|
| 3:39:57| to or seem to grasp the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| the way the MPC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13199)|
| 3:40:01| The MPC has voted it down twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13201)|
| 3:40:03| The last vote was 14-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13203)|
| 3:40:05| You don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13205)|
| 3:40:07| listen to the professionals paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13207)|
| 3:40:09| to analyze these situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| like the engineers and the community planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13211)|
| 3:40:13| Mr. Snowden from Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| and Public Works has asked the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13215)|
| 3:40:17| to defer the action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13217)|
| 3:40:19| so they can study the roads and network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13219)|
| 3:40:21| to create a safer road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| and better routes for the people who live in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13223)|
| 3:40:25| which is a lot of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13225)|
| 3:40:27| that are behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| They all say this road is dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13229)|
| 3:40:31| but you seem to be turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13231)|
| 3:40:33| a deaf ear to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| Why? Because there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13235)|
| 3:40:37| safe and adequate road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13237)|
| 3:40:39| No businesses have moved there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| because there's no road to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| So that shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13243)|
| 3:40:45| even be a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| because if there's no road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| they can't build technology in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13249)|
| 3:40:51| Because there is no safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13251)|
| 3:40:53| and adequate road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13253)|
| 3:40:55| and another thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13255)|
| 3:40:57| does Arden Valley need any more housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| There are at least six to eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| new developments going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13261)|
| 3:41:03| within a five-mile radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13263)|
| 3:41:05| of the Reagan Road area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13265)|
| 3:41:09| You should be concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13269)|
| 3:41:11| the quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13271)|
| 3:41:13| not the quantity of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| you can squeeze in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13275)|
| 3:41:17| to a dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13277)|
| 3:41:19| Now, some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13279)|
| 3:41:21| are still thinking about approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| against the wishes of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13283)|
| 3:41:25| Then we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13285)|
| 3:41:27| to limit it to one to two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| homes per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| because that is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13291)|
| 3:41:33| is established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13293)|
| 3:41:35| in most of the subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| You need to have a vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| to have growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| but include appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| infrastructures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| You can influence this change now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| And I have another person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| who likes to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13313)|
| 3:41:55| Okay. If you would, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13315)|
| 3:41:57| please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13317)|
| 3:41:59| Yes, Lorraine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13319)|

| 3:42:07| to these meetings, but I do question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13327)|
| 3:42:09| the legitimacy of the petitioner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| request. I have with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| two letters from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13333)|
| 3:42:15| one dated 829, the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| the most recent. If I read it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13337)|
| 3:42:19| correctly, it spells out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| the conditions that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13341)|
| 3:42:23| any amendments to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13343)|
| 3:42:25| Please tell me which of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13345)|
| 3:42:27| these requirements have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13347)|
| 3:42:29| The reason for appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13349)|
| 3:42:31| states, unusable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13351)|
| 3:42:33| with present zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13353)|
| 3:42:35| I do not see that listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13355)|
| 3:42:37| as one of the reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13357)|
| 3:42:39| warrants amendments of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| use. Please explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| After attending the most recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13365)|

| 3:42:49| this rezoning, which has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| denied twice, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13371)|
| 3:42:53| husband did some further investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13373)|
| 3:42:55| Just as we suspected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13375)|
| 3:42:57| this rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13377)|
| 3:42:59| is just a foot in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13379)|
| 3:43:01| A parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13381)|
| 3:43:03| directly across the Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13383)|
| 3:43:05| of the same size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13385)|
| 3:43:07| is owned by the same entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13387)|
| 3:43:09| Therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13389)|
| 3:43:11| if you approve this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13391)|
| 3:43:13| next, they will want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13393)|
| 3:43:15| their property across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13395)|
| 3:43:17| the Pellissippi rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13397)|
| 3:43:19| also, because now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| you've set a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| In addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13403)|
| 3:43:25| you're actually approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13405)|
| 3:43:27| future opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13407)|
| 3:43:29| from this proposed subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13409)|
| 3:43:31| to any new business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13411)|
| 3:43:33| being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13413)|
| 3:43:35| Hence, the dissolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13415)|
| 3:43:37| of the technology corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13417)|
| 3:43:39| due to this precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| Is that your plan for the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13421)|
| 3:43:43| Why have an MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13423)|
| 3:43:45| or a technology corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| if this is approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13427)|
| 3:43:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13429)|
| 3:43:51| You are undoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13431)|
| 3:43:53| all the work that's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13433)|
| 3:43:55| to preserve this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13435)|
| 3:43:57| for business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13439)|
| 3:44:03| Mr. C. Merrill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13443)|
| 3:44:07| Your rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13447)|
| 3:44:09| Do you want to take this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13451)|
| 3:44:13| I hear traffic, traffic, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| Mr. Vandervate stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13457)|
| 3:44:19| at a meeting here two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13459)|
| 3:44:21| that this area of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13461)|
| 3:44:23| is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13463)|
| 3:44:25| of very high priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13465)|
| 3:44:27| for Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13467)|
| 3:44:29| and they are working on plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| for a frontage road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13471)|
| 3:44:33| along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13473)|
| 3:44:35| Mr. Biddle has agreed to dedicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13475)|
| 3:44:37| 30 foot of right-of-way along the edge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13477)|
| 3:44:39| of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| towards construction of a frontage road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| which would make this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13483)|
| 3:44:45| very accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13485)|
| 3:44:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| And if people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13489)|
| 3:44:51| if they build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13491)|
| 3:44:53| a subdivision in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13493)|
| 3:44:55| people that live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13495)|
| 3:44:57| then are going to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13497)|
| 3:44:59| this road going through with a business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13499)|
| 3:45:01| right next door to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13501)|
| 3:45:03| That doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13503)|
| 3:45:05| Who would want to have a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13505)|
| 3:45:07| if there's homes in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13507)|
| 3:45:09| and you have a right-of-way through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| it doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13511)|
| 3:45:13| I never got my question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13513)|
| 3:45:15| What reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13515)|
| 3:45:17| does the applicant have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13517)|
| 3:45:19| for the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| I don't see any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| reasons for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13523)|
| 3:45:25| listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| that are listed in the two letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13527)|
| 3:45:29| that we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| on what he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13531)|
| 3:45:33| going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13533)|
| 3:45:35| with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13535)|
| 3:45:37| I don't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13537)|
| 3:45:39| of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| What he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| unusable for present zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| that isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13545)|
| 3:45:47| one of the requirements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13547)|
| 3:45:49| you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13549)|
| 3:45:51| ask for to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| If you explain to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13553)|
| 3:45:55| what is his reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13555)|
| 3:45:57| What legal reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13557)|
| 3:45:59| can he have other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13559)|
| 3:46:01| it's unusable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| It's not unusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13563)|
| 3:46:05| The only problem is the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| Business will go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13567)|
| 3:46:09| if the road is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13569)|
| 3:46:11| Does anybody have an answer for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13571)|
| 3:46:15| Is that a legitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13575)|
| 3:46:17| reason for rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13577)|
| 3:46:19| Unusable with present zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13579)|
| 3:46:25| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13585)|
| 3:46:27| I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| I think that's a legal question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| that one of their attorneys would have to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| and speculate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| There's business land that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| with accessible road now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| that's not developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13599)|
| 3:46:41| I would imagine that would be their argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| My question is for Jim Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13603)|
| 3:46:45| in regards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13605)|
| 3:46:47| chair of HALA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| The discussion we had a month or so ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13609)|
| 3:46:53| in regard to the expansion of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13613)|
| 3:46:55| and development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13615)|
| 3:46:57| What has come of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13617)|
| 3:46:59| and what has transpired through that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13619)|
| 3:47:03| We got CDM Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13623)|
| 3:47:05| a local consultant firm in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13625)|
| 3:47:07| to prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13627)|
| 3:47:09| several options for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13629)|
| 3:47:11| One that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13631)|
| 3:47:13| presented previously that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13633)|
| 3:47:15| extends chair of HALA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13635)|
| 3:47:17| through the center of the Fane property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| One which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13639)|
| 3:47:21| moves it closer to Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13641)|
| 3:47:23| which is what Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| indicates and then one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| actually takes it towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13647)|
| 3:47:29| Knoxville or to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13649)|
| 3:47:31| We just recently received those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13651)|
| 3:47:33| This thing's been moving pretty quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| so we haven't had a lot of time to digest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13655)|
| 3:47:37| that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| We are looking at multiple options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13659)|
| 3:47:41| to determine what's the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13661)|
| 3:47:43| transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13663)|
| 3:47:45| network to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13665)|
| 3:47:47| installed as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13667)|
| 3:47:49| When you talk about it going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13669)|

| 3:48:07| The option we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13687)|
| 3:48:09| at now brings it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13689)|

| 3:48:17| because what we want to try to avoid is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13697)|
| 3:48:19| crossing that line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13699)|
| 3:48:21| for obvious reasons due to the conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| with that gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13703)|

| 3:48:27| looking at actually coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13707)|
| 3:48:29| pretty close to Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| there at Coward Mill so we'd be some distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| from that gas facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| We would have to cross it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13715)|
| 3:48:37| You can kind of see on KJS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13717)|

| 3:48:47| itself. So how do you do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| with Carus Healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13729)|
| 3:48:51| being there on the parking lot and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13731)|
| 3:48:53| That one parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13733)|

| 3:48:57| potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| That's one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| that we haven't got into the fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13741)|

| 3:49:07| that's got like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13747)|

| 3:49:11| that parking lot could be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13751)|
| 3:49:13| We just don't know the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| of that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13755)|
| 3:49:19| I guess you'd be closer to the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| is a little off of Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| so you would cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| the corner of that parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13765)|
| 3:49:27| Would you acquire that business that's for sale there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13767)|
| 3:49:33| On the other corner, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| if it's for sale or for lease but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13775)|
| 3:49:37| maybe a security business there or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13777)|
| 3:49:39| Would that be part of the acquisition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| I'm having a hard time looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13781)|
| 3:49:43| and imagining where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13783)|
| 3:49:45| the frontage road would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13785)|
| 3:49:47| in regards to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13787)|
| 3:49:51| Does that close off Coward Mill at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13791)|
| 3:49:53| Pellissippi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13793)|
| 3:49:55| Above all, we would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13795)|
| 3:49:57| eliminate that conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13797)|
| 3:49:59| There's a lot of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13799)|
| 3:50:01| a lot of high-speed traffic. We want to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13801)|
| 3:50:03| the folks trying to have to get across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13803)|
| 3:50:05| that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13805)|
| 3:50:07| TDOT's in cooperation with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13807)|
| 3:50:09| Obviously, we would want to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13809)|
| 3:50:11| any relocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13811)|

| 3:50:15| that would eliminate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| Whether or not that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13817)|
| 3:50:19| we really can't answer that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| We would definitely try to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| for ways to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13823)|

| 3:51:53| It was their understanding that it was forced on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13913)|
| 3:51:55| that they said you're in the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13915)|

| 3:52:25| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| Basically what you're saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13947)|
| 3:52:29| it wasn't agreed to, it was forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=13949)|

| 3:55:57| that, then you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14157)|
| 3:55:59| improve the infrastructure. Which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14159)|
| 3:56:01| how long is that going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14161)|
| 3:56:03| I mean, it may be years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14163)|
| 3:56:05| And also to go back, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14165)|

| 3:56:09| I had to sit on the phone for quite a bit to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14169)|

| 3:58:03| it's, especially during peak hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14283)|
| 3:58:05| it's very hard to make that movement against all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14285)|
| 3:58:07| traffic. I think TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14287)|
| 3:58:09| and their ultimate goal is to shut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14289)|
| 3:58:11| all those cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14291)|
| 3:58:13| cuts into Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14293)|
| 3:58:15| that are not designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| on and off ramps. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14297)|
| 3:58:19| correct. That's us and TDOT's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14299)|
| 3:58:21| goal, was to make that facility as safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| as we possibly can by doing just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14303)|
| 3:58:25| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14305)|
| 3:58:31| Commissioner Neisman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14311)|
| 3:58:33| Thank you. It seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14313)|
| 3:58:35| like it was this summer, I can't remember the exact date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14315)|
| 3:58:37| when we were first debating this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14317)|
| 3:58:39| the original development had proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14319)|
| 3:58:41| I think it was an apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14321)|
| 3:58:43| in a density of about 10 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14323)|
| 3:58:45| an acre before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14325)|
| 3:58:47| sent it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14327)|
| 3:58:49| I guess part of me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14329)|
| 3:58:51| curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14331)|
| 3:58:53| at that time, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14333)|
| 3:58:55| reviewing 10, and I personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14335)|
| 3:58:57| especially with the Coward Mill on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14337)|
| 3:58:59| one side of it, yeah, I had a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14339)|
| 3:59:01| with an apartment complex going in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14341)|
| 3:59:03| but when you compare the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14343)|
| 3:59:05| for 3.5 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14345)|
| 3:59:07| which is less than it was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14347)|
| 3:59:09| proposed at 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14349)|
| 3:59:11| that density actually seems reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14351)|
| 3:59:13| to me for this property, especially if you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14353)|
| 3:59:15| the access point to be at the Faith Promise Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14355)|
| 3:59:17| which is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14357)|
| 3:59:19| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14359)|
| 3:59:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14365)|

| 3:59:57| specific to this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14397)|

| 4:00:01| in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14401)|

| 4:00:05| which I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14405)|
| 4:00:07| excuse me, FY19, which will be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14407)|
| 4:00:09| upcoming fiscal year, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14409)|
| 4:00:11| believe I've mentioned that at a previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14411)|
| 4:00:13| meeting. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14413)|
| 4:00:15| regardless of the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14415)|

| 4:00:31| you take tonight. Okay. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14431)|
| 4:00:33| will be an FY19 budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14433)|
| 4:00:35| Yes, sir. Upcoming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14435)|

| 4:00:45| how soon would that project actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| go forward? I think we would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14447)|
| 4:00:49| be in right-of-way in design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14449)|

| 4:00:55| and probably move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14455)|
| 4:00:57| construction in the spring of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14457)|

| 4:01:05| Okay. Would that jump ahead of some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14465)|
