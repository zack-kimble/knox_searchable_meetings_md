| 0:03:36| Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| I didn't know I had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Do you have anything you'd like to say to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| No, I thought that the plans that I submitted were pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| We'll have the commission read your recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| The planning commission reads your recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| But you have nothing to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| No, I think the unanimous vote by planning surrounded by, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| I guess I've got a couple of notes that we could go off of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| Well, while you're looking those notes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| go ahead and ask our director to read the recommendation of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Planning commission recommends that county commission approve the PR plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| residential zone up to 12 dwellings per acre because it is consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| To the east, I'm bordered by CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| To the north, I'm bordered by Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| To the south, I'm bordered by old Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| I have one resident that is 102 feet from my property that borders my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| There is another lot owner, but this lot is too small to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| It is actually a parcel owned by another resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| I'm 54 feet from a 12 unit or 12 dwelling per acre zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=296)|
| 0:05:05| owned by the Hensley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| I'm 107 feet from a 12 dwelling unit zone owned by Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| 115 feet from a 12 dwelling acre zone, Waynesboro HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| I'm 102 feet from CA across the street, which is owned by Weigels or LMK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| 136 feet from a multifamily, which is Country Club Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| So you can see that everything around me is, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| I'm 102 feet from the closest house from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| I think the concern that I got an email from Miss Oster last night was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| she was not going to be approving this because it needed a landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| Happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| The willing to put in the sidewalk along old Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| that would also coincide with what LMK has done or is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| I think that's just about all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| I think that fits the one-year sector plan that I was able to pull up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| yesterday and then the growth plan that I guess is still being voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| How did I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Under my time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| I thought you were finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Will the opposition step forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| And would you please state your name and county of residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| My name is Robin Griffin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| and I have the property that adjoins where he wants to put in the townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| I have 8457 and 8453 old Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| I apologize because I wasn't able to come to the first meeting because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| been no signs posted anywhere on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| People behind me don't know what's going on either there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| As of tonight, I even took pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| There's still no signs of zoning or anything that's going on other than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| property's been sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| My concern with that is there are properties around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| There's condos behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| But old Middlebrook Pike is heavy traffic already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| and my concern with putting 12 more units in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| minimum of two cars per house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| You've got kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| You could end up with four to six cars per unit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| Renters coming in and out at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| At least the condos behind me are sold and maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| They're not, you know, changing people all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| Another concern is that my daughter lives at 8457,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| and there's constant wrecks that end up in our yard from old Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| on to Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| I wasn't able to get those statistics because I couldn't get a hold of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| 911 statistics for that, the wrecks that happened there on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| I'm also concerned that where those condos will be coming on to Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| there is no cut through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| So everybody coming out of there will be forced to turn right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| or it will throw the traffic back on to old Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| which is already messed up, potholes, needs to be paved tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| So, of course, I'm against this because, you know, if that does pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| I would like it to see fewer units going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| And I definitely would like to see something besides a tree buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| I would like to see some kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| landscaping either fence or wall like that is across the street on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| Middlebrook that blocks off the noise and the view of that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| exchange there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| But I know that there's the lady that lives next to me is an elderly lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=528)|
| 0:08:57| and she was not able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| Her property rides right up to where the two acres will be joining there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| But I would just like you to consider all the traffic going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| Fewer units would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| greater liability of less wrecks on Middlebrook and old Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=558)|

| 0:09:20| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Commissioners, are there any questions or comments about this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=563)|
| 0:09:31| Commissioner or Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| what would an example of the landscaping requirement be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| This does look like a very condensed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| awkward piece of property with the way the roads run on both sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| you all have several different options that we reference on a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| So the type A screening, which is more dense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| those are typically found along boundaries of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| and industrial developments that are adjoining residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| And that's a continuous screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| And then there's also the type B screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| That's another one that typically screens parking and loading areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| adjoin residential and office districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| And that includes shrubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| and also can include a masonry wall or timber fence with evergreen trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| And then we have a type C, which is partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| And those are typically found between adjoining residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=640)|
| 0:10:49| You did read the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Was there any additional report or anything to say to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Do you have a sense for what the recommendation might be as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=662)|
| 0:11:10| landscaping goes in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| For a landscape screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| we would typically recommend the type B or type C, which is the type B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| again, is the shrubs with a combination of evergreens and potentially a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=683)|
| 0:11:32| And that seems it might address most of the concerns of the adjoining neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| And Director Snowden, I know you don't have a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=700)|
| 0:11:49| but what would your requirement be as far as entrance and access on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| particular piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Yeah, Chair Lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| We would most likely grant full access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| He has an access, or his property looks like it could possibly align with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| Roswell Road, which is one of the entrances into that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| Obviously that would create the fewest conflict points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| So that would be our preferred location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| And on Middlebrook Pike, obviously that's a state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| He would have a right in, right out at best if TDOT even allowed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| We have spoke to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| The adjoining property to the east is being expanded to a new Weigel store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| We have asked Mr. Weigel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| and he has agreed to install a sidewalk along that portion of his new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| It's not there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| And then we will ask this gentleman to install a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| So if you do reside in these developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| you'll be able to walk from his property all the way to the sidewalks on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| North Galahad View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| So that's just kind of a brief snippet of what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| from an infrastructure improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| we would be asking of this individual and what that plan might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Any other questions or comments before I turn it over to the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| I've seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Does Director Brooks know on these units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| is this going to be a multi-story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| I have not reviewed a site plan for the development that they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Is this going to be a multi-store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=819)|
| 0:13:49| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| I had submitted plans and drawings to planning and met with them downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| to show kind of what I was looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| It is a two-story with a garage, three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| 1,457 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| We'll stay here until we finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| Is that a problem, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| I'm going to lean on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| I did speak with Mr. Barnes, emailed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| We've actually spoken a couple of times on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| He got his original zoning at nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Planning went back and gave him 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| I'd stated I was more comfortable with nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| just hearing from other community members in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Old Middlebrook is a very small road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| If nobody's ever been over there, it has no shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| And we really don't know, as Director Snowden said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| that we're going to get any ride in, ride out on Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| with it being a state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| I can't imagine just looking at it at any time of day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| that TDOT is probably going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| But that's not for me to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| I just feel like it's very unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| So I have been comfortable with the nine units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| So my motion will be to approve nine units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| It's also going to be installing landscape buffer B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| And we will also go ahead and add the condition of the sidewalks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| front of the new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Is there any discussion on this motion with the conditions presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| Your motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| When can I apply for the 12 again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| Director Brooks, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| You have to wait a year to request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| One year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Can I ask one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| So the driveway would be off of Roswell, which you recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| That's what we had planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| We're not doing the ride in, ride out off Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| TDOT had a lot of concerns with it being within 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| The ride in, ride out would then T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| I have to hammerhead that for fire trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| There would be four on the left, four on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| So at this time, given a nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| I can build three of them and leave the fourth pad available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| And then in one year can reapply to build that fourth one in to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Is that what I understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1009)|

| 0:16:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| If you want to request additional density on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| you can do that within a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| But until then can build three of the four and leave that fourth pad dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| As long as you don't approve, don't exceed the density approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1031)|

| 0:18:52| Did you like to speak to this item, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| I'm really excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| This is, I think, a unique opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| It's not often you find 18.707 acres of property on a road as underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| as Outlet Drive that has the existing infrastructure in place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| Outlet Drive has on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| I think when we were talking about finding areas to mitigate against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| sprawl and find where you can concentrate density in a walkable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| in the county, this is just the perfect fit for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| It is right across the street from the Topgolf facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| In 2019, the Town of Farragut changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| They created a new zoning district called the Outlet Drive Regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Entertainment and Employment District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| It's a mouthful, but they did that to attract businesses like Topgolf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| They've been discussing plans of a hotel there, of restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| and other amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| If you don't know Outlet Drive, it's a three-lane road, one going east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| one going west, with a center turn lane, but it feels like a five-lane road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| as easy as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| If you live in that area like I do and you need to get between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Lovell Road and Campbell Station, Outlet Drive is the best place to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| because Kingston Pike is usually backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| The interstate is usually backed up most times of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| But Outlet Drive has plenty of capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| It's very pedestrian-friendly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| It has a sidewalk on one side of this location and a greenway at the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| And it's underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| There's plenty of commercial businesses in the county just east of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| that really have not found a lot of opportunity to really flourish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| and really meet its full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Pretty much the only business there that really has flourished is Cotton Eye Joe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| and that's a different story altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| But what we're asking for is to go from the medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| to medium-density residential slash office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| which if you look at the location criteria in our current sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| that's traditionally considered a kind of a transition zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| between low-density residential and more intense uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| There is HDR sector plan immediately to the west at the apartments for the tapestry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| even though it's only built out at 18 and zoned at 18 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| But there's the entertainment district across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| There is Buddy Greg, and there's a boat dealership just further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| just on the other side of the intersection of Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| So this is really an odd mix of land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| and this is a nice transition zone to this older existing neighborhood that's RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Now, there is that neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| It's been developed for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| The unique thing about that neighborhood is even though we'd be right next to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| they're kind of set back further from Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| They don't have access to Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| We don't have access to their neighborhood or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| All of our traffic will come on Outlet Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| and their traffic has been going out onto Lovell Road kind of to the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| So there's no real cross-contamination, if you will, of the traffic or the impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| What we did, we've been very involved in trying to be transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| with what we're trying to do with this property, and we met with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| We sent letters out to the ten neighbors that are adjacent to our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| on the eastern property line, and we met with six of those households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| They actually came to our meeting, and we showed them the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| and what our plans are, I mean, we are looking to zone this to OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| so we can do between 12 and 24 units an acre on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| We've conceptualized it at 12 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| but because of the size of the property and the opportunity it presents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| we can kind of feather that density where we keep all the real high density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| adjacent to the existing multifamily properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| and next to the neighbors we're looking at a townhome development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| And we think that's really kind of a two-story, kind of the same form and scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| of the single-family residential neighborhood, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| I think you heard Mr. Odom from the Chamber talk about the largest demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| growing in this area is the 55-plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| These types of developments, they really cater to, one, young urban professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| looking for a really nice place to live, maybe not able to afford a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| but want that kind of a lower-maintenance type of living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| or people that are wanting to downsize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| And having a townhome like that really presents an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| And we've talked about our plans and what we are wanting to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| Even in the more traditional multifamily, those are air-conditioned corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| garage entry, elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| So it's something that really could speak to somebody who's not quite ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| to an assisted-living facility but are looking to maybe downsize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| or something lower-maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| So when we're talking about the Advanced NOx initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| and trying to look at building where there's existing infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| this checks all the boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| And that's no coincidence that the proposed place type for that property is SMR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Suburban Mixed Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| When you look at the Appendix H use matrix, you guys are familiar with this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| I'm joking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| It's a bad joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| That's okay, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| You can wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| The RB, as general residential, is a directly related use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| and the OB is a partially related use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| But what that's significant is the only reason OB allows this type of residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| is because it incorporates within itself all the residential uses that RB allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| So even with the plans that we've been working towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| this RB zoning or OB zoning would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| The only reason we asked for OB was just to make sure we can meet a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| designation that kind of meets the current location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| So we'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| We're really excited about this project, and we hope that you support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Just a quick question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| I saw that staff recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Can you speak to that, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Staff did recommend denial of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| I think that they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| we were challenged to find any recent changes to justify the change in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| sector plan in our initial look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| And additionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| staff looked at this as a transition between that higher density adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| down to the RA zone property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| And the future land use map has it as suburban mixed residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| and that does overlay with the Town of Farragut's urban growth boundary and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| their growth map, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| And commissioners, let me just apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| This whole meeting, my platform doesn't seem to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| And since we don't have lights anymore, I'm not able to track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| So I have to kind of rely on the circle on your microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| I think Commissioner, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| I just want to really brag on you guys because it's kind of after my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| heart when a developer goes, there we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| goes to the takes the time to go to the homeowners and get feedback and let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| them know what they're doing first is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| And of course we're going to brag on your representative as we did at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| But I just appreciate the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| I think it's a really good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| And I think that you guys are doing it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| So I just wanted to commend you on record for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Commissioner on outlet drive where this property is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Is that the terminus of Knox County's jurisdiction of the road that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| have from that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| everything West and the town of Farrakhan has jurisdiction of everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| to the right of that property or East all the way to level road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| It's really strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| It is kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| I think it looks like what we maintain is kind of the good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| some of the portion of their frontage as well as where the tapestry is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| And then a little bit to the West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| So it kind of comes in and out of jurisdictions through there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| And then we pick up, like, we maintain the signal at level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| but so you kind of come in and out of the town of Farragut versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| county in Knoxville, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| So would the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| have you been apprised as far as the entrance to these units where would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| that come in off of Knox County's jurisdiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| In my, it's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Is I had spoken to both Mark Shipley and Daryl Smith at the town and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| clarity from them because certainly we wanted to be in agreeance with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| And based on my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| when we built out the drive back years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| we acquired the right of way that adjacent that's the frontage adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| So it's my opinion that that is the county's right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| And we would permit the access as, as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| as I've seen it being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| But most people leaving this development would most likely go East to level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| road to have access to all the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| It's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I mean, there's signals on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| There's draws on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| So I think a case could be made for somewhat of an equal traffic distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| I mean, they both have interstate ramps at both the level and Campbell station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| So, I mean, I haven't seen a traffic study yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| but I think a fairly even distribution could be argued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| And then this question is for director Brooks is because the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| is on the West side of the tapestry development and South of this proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Is this property in the town of Farragut urban growth area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| And so the tapestry, when that was originally rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| it was originally eight units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| And then the developer got it bumped to 12 or was it originally 12 and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| bumped to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| They did have it increased to 18, but I believe that they started with 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| I'd have to look further back in the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| And then this project is asking, they're 12 now they could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| and now they're asking for 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| So that'd be roughly 217 units on the 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| Is that a question for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| I'd have to do the math, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| I can clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| We're not asking for a specific density to be imposed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| We're not asking for the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| We're asking for the OB, the office zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| which allows all the uses that the RB allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| So it allows up to 12 by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| And somewhere between 12 and 24 would have to be the residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| So it allows up to 12 by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| And somewhere between 12 and 24 would have to come through a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| So we're not asking for a specific, like 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| We're asking for somewhere in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| We haven't done the full engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| We've conceptualized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| And our traffic impact is intended to look at it as if we could do 24 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| an acre on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| But I don't know if we'll be able to get that on it or not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| So that could be 250 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| I'm trying to do the math fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| You're asking me to do math at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| That's a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Director Brooks, is the urban growth area that Farragut deemed on a map in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1864)|
| 0:31:14| all of the town of Farragut, or does it extend beyond the town of Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| It extends beyond the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| It's an urban growth boundary for the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| We've run into this several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Can you help us understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| The town of Farragut has a very distinct property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| How is it that they can put their arms farther than their own property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| and say we think this is our growth area too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| Well, I can try to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| But, you know, when the growth policy plan was first developed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| there was a lot of concern over annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| And so the idea was these are areas that might be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| for further annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| So I would say that that was originally probably how they were proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| I wasn't here at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Which is by state law not available at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| It's not available anymore, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| With all due respect to our friends in the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| we've run into this several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| I think the town of Farragut has a, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| they have a definitive property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| and we have a definitive property line and we should respect each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| and not because of what would be the difference between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| Imagine us creating a proposed land use map that says we think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| particular area inside of the town of Farragut is what we think it ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| be versus our jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| They would absolutely lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| So I just think that's not a factor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| And we ought to stick to our own actual property lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| and focus on what we control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| I have a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| I did run the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| If you build it out at 18 units an acre, that's 324 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| If you build it out at 24 units, that's 432 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| And that gives us the opportunity to kind of keep the higher density next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| the tapestry and kind of feather it down to getting the two-story townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| on the eastern side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| It allows us that flexibility and also to build in certain amenities like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| you know, we have proposed here at Pocket Park, some trailways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| One thing I forgot to mention with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| that they asked for a privacy fence and an increased landscaping buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| and we're happy to provide that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2018)|

| 0:33:42| This being in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| I'm very impressed with the homework that's been done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| I think this plan is beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| I think that the location is extremely appropriate given outlet drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2037)|
| 0:34:08| To my commissioner in District 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| I might say I can see the cash registers cha-chinging in the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| So I have absolutely no problem recommending this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| and I really appreciate what you did with the neighbors that are nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| I mean, you all did not hide from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| You went straight to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| You spoke to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2075)|

| 0:37:14| Is there any opposition on this present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| Would you please come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| My name is Herb Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| I live in Ruggles Ferry Community in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| If you'll hold on just a minute, I'll ask for the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve PR plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| residential zone with up to three dwelling units per acre because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| The applicant has five minutes to speak to this, as well as the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| I appreciate y'all's time and appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| My oldest daughter happened to be at this meeting and she just sent me a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| text and she goes, how do you do this all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| So I appreciate y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I would respectfully request that y'all approve as per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| as per voted on 13-0 by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| I believe it meets all the criteria required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| It's consistent with the zoning, consistent with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| and, again, I appreciate y'all's time and respectfully request you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Would the opposition like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| Yes, I'd like to say I'm representing the Ruggles Ferry Community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| and since development has started in that area and many proposed developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2322)|
| 0:38:51| we have made as a community a strong point that we're not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| We are oftentimes opposed to the density of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| We don't think that higher density developments are a fit for the rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| In the Asheville Highway, Andrew Johnson Highway, Holston River Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| in that area, approximately 6,000 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| The average lot size is seven acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Many rural farms in excess of 100 acres, and it's been in the rural state for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2360)|
| 0:39:30| One gentleman here tonight was born in that community, and he's 70-plus years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| and he was born on the farm that he currently lives on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| and we have those types of farms in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| Again, we're not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| We like responsible development, and the proposed or the recommended three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| we feel for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| It's 23 acres with approximately four acres of slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| There's a high-powered line that runs across it, which will get another acre and a half, two acres perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| So that means 69 houses could be built on approximately 17 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| which puts it in almost four units per acre as a buildout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| And I realize that three units per acre, how that's calculated, I'm very familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2414)|
| 0:40:22| I would ask that my preference is for the development to be not approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| but I realize that we're not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| I would like to see it done at a maximum of two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| which is sort of in line with what's coming up on the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| We feel that that would maybe be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Also, Wooddale Road is not 18 feet wide, and it's approximately a quarter of a mile off of Ruggles Ferry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| and that road needs improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| And I don't think we should saddle the developer with those type of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| I think what he does on site is acceptable and taken over by the county and all like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| but we as a county need to take responsibility for providing the infrastructure to these developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| and not making it an unsafe access to such developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| It's important to the communities to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| and it's a very, very narrow road, access to that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| and with the proposed subdivision that the road's 26 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| it's approximately 10 feet wider than the road that accesses that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| So it's not a good fit for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| I would like to recommend or request that you deny the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| and if you choose to move forward with it, limit it to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| I would also like to say that during this process, and I talked to Mr. Davis prior to this coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| and I appreciated one thing that he said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| I've elevated from the vocal minority to the elite activist, and I am neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2536)|
| 0:42:26| I'm a concerned citizen for the communities that we live in, not just Ruggles Ferry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| but all of the county and the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| So the labels that we put on groups such as Ruggles Ferry, the Corrington, Rita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| and all that community shouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| I have great respect for what you people do and for what our planning commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| I was a planning commissioner for about seven and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| and I respect highly what you all do and the decisions you have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| I know it's difficult many times, and I know we're not going to please everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| and I would ask that you be conservative in your decisions that you make here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2585)|
| 0:43:13| and I appreciate your input, and I appreciate the commissioners that I've contacted regarding this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| and your feedback to me and to other peoples that have contacted you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| If you tapped your screen, touch your screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Mr. Snowden, Director Snowden, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| Is the entrance going to be on Wooddale, and do they have the site distance there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| and the speed limit and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| That looks like a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| You can't tell by this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| We haven't obviously seen site plan specifically, but it's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| Obviously, we will require them to have line of sight on Wooddale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| and then potentially make some improvements to Wooddale Road because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| to Mr. Anders' point, it is a little bit narrower on the north end versus the south end of Ruggles Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2656)|
| 0:44:30| Is that all you had to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Ms. Brooks, what is the one condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| The one condition is that the rear of the parcel with slopes of 25 percent or greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| at approximately beyond the 960 contour line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| So that's the slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Mr. Snowden, I drove this property this weekend, and it looks, if I'm correct, the access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| although it was hard to get up and it was clearly private property to a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| is this little sliver right next to parcel 55, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| I mean, it's a little narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| It's like a driveway almost, but is that a county road or is that just an access easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2717)|
| 0:45:25| I'm looking at it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| It's not a county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| It looks like to be an easement for a couple of parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| So the entrance wouldn't really be able to go up that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| So it really is going to have to hit Wooddale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| And so you'll have to do, based on the concept plan, you'll have to determine if road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| are warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| And that'll come later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Those are all my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2756)|

| 0:46:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Appreciate Mr. Anders' remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| I mean, we're really all just country folks trying to, you know, protect our interests in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| And whether we're from Ruggles Ferry or Carleton or wherever we're from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| not all of us are farmers and not all of us live on acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| Some of us live in subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| But the point is, everybody has interests in this that they're trying to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| And I do have tremendous respect for Herb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| We've talked a lot during this process about many different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Mr. Davis has been a friend for a long, long time, since well before I had any interest in county commission or land use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| So respect both these men and what they are trying to fight for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| The issue with this one, it really comes down to the parameters of what we use to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2818)|
| 0:47:08| And this property is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| It actually borders the urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| This, you know, could easily qualify for a five per acre application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2836)|
| 0:47:24| And when you get down to density here, to say no to three per acre is really more of a preference issue than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2844)|
| 0:47:35| I mean, it meets every criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| I would like to see, Mr. Snowden, if it's possible to make some modest improvements to Wooddale Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| because there's really only about five modest sized lots between Wooddale Road and Rubble Strait Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| But, you know, regardless of my preference, I think the parameters of what's before us on the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2874)|
| 0:48:03| and not only on the plans, but as I look at the plan that we're going to be considering here in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| this is proposed to be in the suburban residential area, which also supports up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| So I will I will offer a motion to approve this per the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2898)|
| 0:48:28| And also with the the ask of Mr. Davis that this would be as clustered as possible to preserve as much of this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2908)|
| 0:48:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| We have a motion on the floor by Beeler, second by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| Is there is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| Seen none. All those in favor? Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| One no. No appraisers. Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| Madam Chair. Yes. May I make one more further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| I've known this man for a lot of years as well, Richie, and I have great respect for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| And this is in no way personal. We've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| We know. And and I appreciate what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| And I'm not one of those guys that says not in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| We have a difference of opinion of density and y'all have spoken and I'll respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| And I'll twist his arm to see how it's done. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| Thank you, Mr. Anders. I appreciate thank you all for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| And we'll work with Mr. Anders and the neighbors on trying to make this a good development for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| Thank you, Mr. Davis. We appreciate it. Appreciate you both. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=2988)|

| 0:51:00| Thank you. You have five minutes to speak, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| Good evening, commission. My family owns a farm, raw land on Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3067)|
| 0:51:16| As the landowner, we don't want to farm it. We don't want to mow it. We don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| We won't develop it. That's not the popular opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| But as the landowner and as the rules and regulations that this government has set before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| we have every right to check the boxes that are put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| We asked for three units an acre. The growth policy plan came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| It went from three units an acre down to two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| OK, we are here to accept the two units an acre as the as the commission wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| Next thing we have to do is prove there's infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| We had a traffic impact study done. It said no additional infrastructure will be needed for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| OK, box checked. Then we have to prove that has sewer water and electric that can house the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| Well, there's a development that's three inch maker right next door. So we check that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| So now that we have compromised down to two units an acre, we've checked every box that has been put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3125)|
| 0:52:15| We're asking you so in this two inch maker and let us build a development in Gibbs for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3142)|
| 0:52:31| Thank you, Madam Chair. I actually ask you to support the recommendation of staff, which was to deny the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3151)|
| 0:52:39| The original application was for LDR. Staff recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Planning Commission recommended rural residential staff got this correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| The only reason planning commission gave for a different recommendation is because it is in character with the surrounding agricultural and rural residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3169)|
| 0:52:57| Now, that's quite the stretch for the imagination. Now, there actually are boxes that you need to check when you are requesting a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3177)|
| 0:53:05| There's criteria and you have to meet one of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| Staff's report indicate clearly called out that this amendment request doesn't meet any of those three criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| First, there is no obvious or significant error in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| The 2015 sector plan update deliberately said almost all of Northeast Knox as agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| And that occurred well after the subdivision to the south was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| That subdivision itself actually reverted back to agricultural in that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| So there was no update. And I'd also argue that the sector plan designation of agricultural is absolutely correct for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3217)|
| 0:53:45| This parcel meets all the location criteria for the agricultural land use classification in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| In fact, it meets the even stricter classification criteria to be considered agricultural conservation sector plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| which is where you have undeveloped tracks with the best soils for agriculture are considered as the primary hour areas for the agricultural conservation land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3238)|
| 0:54:08| This tract is undeveloped with approximately 65 percent of prime or locally important farmland soil on this parcel, according to the soil map on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3248)|
| 0:54:18| The other criteria, the last criteria, there has not been trends in development, population or traffic that warrant reconsideration of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3258)|
| 0:54:27| There's nothing nothing happening out there. So this fails to meet any criteria that would justify a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| Finally, I want to call your attention to the principles on page 28 of the general plan under section six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| It states that prime agricultural land should be protected for continued farm use in the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| The rural areas designated in the growth policy plan should be conserved, including open space, historic sites and farm buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| Now, while you're pondering this case, I know we're also thinking about item 35 later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| The draft sector plan, as it was recommended by the staff to plan commission, had four criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| So and those were essentially the three that we have today, plus an additional criteria that proposed changes support policies, goals and objectives of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3303)|
| 0:55:13| The original final draft said two criteria of two of those four need to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| Planning Commission changes being one criterion added a little bit more on roads, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| But if you find that you can improve this sector plan amendment under the existing criteria tonight, well, that's pretty much the same ones you're going to have in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3325)|
| 0:55:34| So you will see how easy it is to amend the new comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| So in conclusion, they haven't met the any of the criteria for a sector plan amendment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| It actually is great agricultural land. Some of the farmers in the area have remarked about how dark that soil is and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3345)|
| 0:55:53| What robust production there is of hay and silage and other material from that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| So I'd ask you to deny the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3357)|
| 0:56:11| Are there any comments from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| I see no lights. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| Thank you, Madam Chair. Just a clarification, Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| So what Mr. Murphy testified to is that an accurate statement that the applicant did not meet any of the qualifications to have a sector plan change is what your employees said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3386)|
| 0:56:42| The Planning Commission did say that they did meet the criteria and didn't recommend LDR, but recommended the rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| Now, I'm asking, did your staff, when they reviewed it, your employees, they said that it didn't meet the criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3410)|
| 0:56:59| There are staff said deny the LDR land use classification because it'd be out of character with the surrounding agriculture and rural residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3419)|
| 0:57:07| OK, so Mr. Murphy's comments then are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| Can't speak. I'm not going to speak to all of Mr. Murphy's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| I'll just share what the staff's recommendation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| Are there any other questions or comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3444)|
| 0:57:32| Quickly, sir, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| No, I'll leave it to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| Seeing no other lights. Commissioner Veiler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you, Madam Chair. Seven to six vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| So, Ms. Brooks, what what was the Planning Commission's justification for approving this sector plan amendment to rural residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3469)|
| 0:58:00| They felt that that particular land use classification was in character with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| OK. So there is a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| I mean, they're not a parcel now, but there is a subdivision right next to this property that is zoned PR at up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| Correct. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| OK. And there is a parcel across the road that is zoned PR at up to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| Yes, that is correct. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| So how did how did those zonings come about? Were they were they there before sector plans or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3516)|
| 0:58:46| See. So the one. No. The one to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| That was approved for a sector plan amendment from ag rural residential to LDR in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3531)|
| 0:59:00| And then I don't know that our staff report speaks to the one across the street, but I can look into the date of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3540)|
| 0:59:08| OK. So. So the neighboring parcel then was approved for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| That is correct. Yes. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| Yeah, this. This is tough because I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3559)|
| 0:59:31| You know, I mean, I'm giving my hand away, but I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| I do support the vast majority of the amendments to the to the to the comprehensive plan that we're going to be considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3576)|
| 0:59:46| But at the same time, I look on this handout that Mr. Murphy gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3586)|
| 0:59:56| Talking about the issue priorities for residents, for local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| and the first one was increasing the amount of housing that is affordable for most families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| And the second one is protecting open spaces like fields and forests, farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| I mean, so they are like right there next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| And that's where all 11 of us are living right now, right there between those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| And, you know, like I said, I support the vast majority of the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| You know, I agree with you guys on most things. I wish I agreed with you on everything, but I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3626)|
| 1:00:35| Because when push comes to shove, I'm in the people business, not the land business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| That's just who I am. That's my heart. And it is my calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| I am about people and people need houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| And they don't they don't they don't they're not looking for them in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| They're looking for them in a place that's good to raise a young family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| My point. Here's the point I'm making. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| Along Washington Pike from Murphy Road to the county line, which is approximately 12 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| There are two subdivisions of any size. Neither of them are very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| There are two. One was developed in 2002. The other was developed in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| So in 20 years, there have not been any new subdivisions developed on Washington Pike between Murphy Road and the county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3682)|
| 1:01:32| There are two subdivisions on Roberts Road between Emery Road and Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| Neither of them are very large. One was developed in 2005, the other in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| So in 17 years, there hasn't been a new subdivision developed on Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| The point I'm making is not that we need a bunch more subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| The point I'm making is I believe reasonable growth is possible and reasonable and feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| You know, I hear people say we know growth is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| We're not against growth. But then every time growth is mentioned, it's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| It's a no. It's a no. And I just I struggle with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| I do, because we people, not people from California, but people from here, people from my own community that want to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3736)|
| 1:02:28| They struggle to find a house they can afford to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| You know, we know what the median housing price has done in the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| It's almost doubled. It's gone from 225 to 425, I think, something along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| My church just called a new worship leader. He and his family moved here from Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| They can't find a home because to find a home comparable to the one they're leaving in Alabama would cost over half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3771)|
| 1:03:00| And they're not living in a half million dollar home there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| And I just struggle that that that we keep saying no, no, no to to any kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| And there just there hasn't been very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| There's been a lot around Harbison's Crossroads, which is like a town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| But, you know, what I can see here is a conservation subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| I believe this is going to be Miss Brooks. Let me ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| OK. In a rural living place type, could you could you explain what the density levels that are permitted in a rural living place type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3812)|
| 1:03:44| Both in and out of the planned growth area as currently proposed and currently proposed in rural living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3824)|
| 1:03:55| You can densities up to five dwelling units per acre can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| OK. If if if the two to five were removed from the rural areas, it would still be one to two. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3842)|
| 1:04:11| Well, let me yeah, let me be clear. In the rural area, you're capped at two. No more than two can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| But but it is two as of as proposed now as approved with the policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| Yes. Right. It's two. So, I mean, I guess it comes down to whether you think this sector plan is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3861)|
| 1:04:33| And I mean, I'll put it out there for a motion to approve the Planning Commission's recommendation for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| Let the vote go as it may. We have a motion on the floor to approve by Bieler, a second by Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| Is there any further discussion? Seeing none. All those in favor. Aye. Any opposition? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3885)|
| 1:04:56| Opposition. I heard nays by Lee and by Frazier. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| Thank you. Motion passes. Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| Number 46 is to dash J dash 24 dash RZ. Also a request of Smith built homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| This is for rezoning from a agricultural to PR plan residential up to three point oh dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| And the property description is the same as the previous item. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| Is the applicant present? I need for you to introduce yourself again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| Josh Sanderson. Forty nine. Oh nine. Ball Road, Knox County. Thank you. Is there opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| Also, Mr. Murphy, I need for you to please come forward again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| Kevin Murphy, Knox County. Thank you, Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| Planning Commission recommends that county commission approve the PR plan residential zone up to two dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| because it is consistent with the surrounding development and a minor extension of the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson. Would you like to speak to your project? I have no comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3967)|
| 1:06:15| Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Do you have comments to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3975)|
| 1:06:22| Yes, Madam Chair. First, I'd like to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| You've made the case for why we need we think we need stricter criteria for amending the future land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3986)|
| 1:06:34| because that one we believe strongly in the staff reports went through all those criteria and did state that each one of those wasn't met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=3994)|
| 1:06:42| So in the face of that, this is this is what we got regarding the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4002)|
| 1:06:49| I urge you to deny the request planned residential. This property is in the middle of an established rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| And the zoning requests are just that their request for legislative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| There is no obligation to grant that request. And a valid option is to not rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| Today, the owner has all the land use rights that they did when they purchased the property previously, just a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| The ordinance has four criteria that must be met for a zoning map amendment request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| And it says shall be met. And it means all four of them. I believe it meets three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| Criteria A states that there must be substantially changed or changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| And here there aren't any changing conditions. As Commissioner Buehler, as you just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| there's not been a lot of new subdivision development out there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| You know, the the natural environment isn't changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| There haven't been notable transportation projects in the area recently. The subdivision to the south was approved in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4065)|
| 1:07:53| But, you know, if anything, conditions in this area are changing to much less of a degree than the rest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| Criteria C in the zoning ordinance not having adverse impact has not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| The proposed amendment has a direct and indirect adverse effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| The direct effect is the loss of 50 acres of prime farmland soil that we will never get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4088)|
| 1:08:15| And additionally, the planned residential zone has no development standard standards to ensure compatibility with the adjacent agricultural uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| Finally, criteria for consistency with the general plan is not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| As stated previously, the general plan actually states that has a principle that prime agricultural land should be continued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| protected for continued farmland use. You know, that's that's not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| I think this application is an example of where we need better standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| There might be some ways to do this development in a way that actually could work out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| There has been I don't want you to confuse this with rural conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| but there has been a call in for all of our plans since the 2003 general plan to enact conservation subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4132)|
| 1:09:00| That's where you can say we're going to set aside a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| And then, you know, that will be either land trust or it'll be a farm or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| And then for the rest of it, you know, that's where you can develop and we'll put the density in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| There have been calls for that. Your hillside and ridgetop protection plan has a model conservation subdivision ordinance that was written for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4153)|
| 1:09:20| and included as an appendix that is there ready for you to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| But nobody's ever actually adopted it. So we don't have that tool in our toolbox today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| But this is something we've been calling for for years. So there are ways to have our cake and eat it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| But because we haven't acted, we we get faced with this. The only option that you have is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| You can try and attach conditions on it and come up with those right now. But that's not in the application or staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| So I urge you to deny this rezoning because you could actually reconsider it or they can reapply later when you do have a toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4188)|
| 1:09:57| Maybe it's when they have a new idea or something, but you have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| We just don't have land use regulations that let you develop this really well yet. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4200)|
| 1:10:14| Yes. Brief comment. We have every intention of clustering this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| We don't want to run roads, sidewalks and everything that the county and the tax burden or the tax is on the burden of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| We have every intention of of clustering the subdivision and leaving the least amount of raw land disturbed and leaving it as open space or amenity area or green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4224)|
| 1:10:35| Something that people that are by our homes are getting accustomed to. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4235)|
| 1:10:44| Thank you. And just a quick question, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| Seventy five acres. Is that correct? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| Do you have any guesstimate how when you and I appreciate your clustering that how much of that actually may still remain undisturbed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4252)|
| 1:11:03| We haven't done a site plan yet, knowing that this whole process was kind of in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| Thank you. Thank you. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Murphy, I have a question, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| And this applies to this particular zoning, but I think it applies to so many others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| You've mentioned several times that farmland should be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| If you have a property owner, this is I don't want to be a farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| Are you suggesting that you're forcing that person to to say your land is only available for farming and you can do nothing else with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4296)|
| 1:11:45| I mean, wouldn't that erode our basic tenants of private property rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| So the the rights that are they currently have are what they're currently zoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| So it's currently zoned agricultural. That's what are their vested rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| You're asking about changing land use zoning, being a legislative decision that can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| And that's where county land policy comes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| There are absolutely ways that we could actually have good policy and regulations that would allow them to explore opportunities for some development while conserving some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4331)|
| 1:12:20| And we could have a win win. Been asking for that for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| What if somebody doesn't want what if any one of the neighbors that are here today, if their children don't want to be a farmer, don't don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4346)|
| 1:12:37| Or what if at some point they don't want to be a farmer and they want to pay for their kids education or for their retirement or for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| Like do we are you suggesting that this body start saying this is what you should use your land for and that only and kind of handcuff the community into what the future decisions could be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4364)|
| 1:12:56| So it was it currently is a farm and that's the value that is vested in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| This isn't a farm. This is a field. This is not being farmed. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| I believe it's been farmed for a number of years up until now. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| OK. But I guess what this is sort of a bigger philosophical question, but you've advocated for this several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| I just want to be really clear. As this body moves forward, are you advocating that, you know, we tell people what to do with their land very proactively if they choose not to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4398)|
| 1:13:28| Because this might be this particular development, but the next month it may be somebody else that that isn't in the development business that owns a piece of land and says, you know, I just don't want to do this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4408)|
| 1:13:40| Yeah. So it sounds like you're asking, you know, what's the value of the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| And the value of the land is a combination of current zoning and uses that are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| And then also there's speculative value of what might I be able to get forward in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| I don't think I'm asking about the value of land. I'm asking about what's the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| What's the purpose of government's role in determining how you should live your life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| I think that's I think that's what I'm getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| And I respect I respect everybody that wants to to live in certain places or to work in certain professions or to pursue certain passions or to to develop continued legacies of their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4447)|
| 1:14:22| I'm just I'm trying to better understand how this body, you know, what is our role as government to versus the private property rights and the free will of of a people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4462)|
| 1:14:31| And I'm just sort of trying to clarify a little bit and we maybe we can have a longer discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| I appreciate it. That is that is the tricky area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| And that's why land use is so not only contentious, but important because land use really a policy really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4480)|
| 1:14:49| It impacts our community in ways that are permanent and difficult to under race, especially when you're taking vacant undeveloped land and developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4489)|
| 1:14:58| Well, it's really hard to get that farmland back. So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| We'll continue the discussion. Thank you, Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| Thank you, Madam Chair. Director Snowden, I know Mr. Sanderson said that they had done or conducted a traffic impact study and it didn't indicate any improvements on Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4505)|
| 1:15:15| Looking at Roberts Road, do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| Or I mean, this is a pretty narrow road with no shoulders, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4520)|
| 1:15:28| You know, Roberts is probably in the neighborhood of 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| So I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as narrow. It does have some areas that maybe the shoulders need to be improved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| But it's been a minute since I've looked at the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| I know they looked at turn lane thresholds at both Emory and Washington Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| And I believe based on this density, there weren't any offsite improvements recommended as part of that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| So you going forward, if this were to be approved, the county would not require any improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4555)|
| 1:16:05| Based on what we saw from their traffic study, we don't necessarily believe that there are offsite improvements necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| There may be some shoulders that we need to look at that are existing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| But I do not believe, based on the study that we saw, that there would be offsite improvements required by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| Seeing no other lights, Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| There's not much more I can say as far as I've stated my heart, my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| I move for approval of two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422-zoning?start=4602)|
