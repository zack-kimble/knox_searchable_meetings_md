| 0:02:18| I want to start by having the annual report from our police advisory and review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| Who is delivering that? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=145)|

| 0:02:34| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| I am Ola Blackman McBride, 1145 Winding Way Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=155)|
| 0:02:46| To Mayor O'Hara and the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| we want to thank you for this opportunity to come before you tonight to present the police advisory review committee 2012 annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=168)|
| 0:02:59| Within the report that all of you should have received, you will see our operations report for 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| In 2012, you would note that the cases that came before us went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| To us, that's a sign that things are working well, that the police advisory review committee is doing what it's supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=193)|
| 0:03:23| Before I go further, I want to acknowledge the hard work of the executive director, Mrs. Avis Reed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| and her assistant, Lisa Chambers, who do the day-to-day operations, Ms. Reed and Ms. Chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| But also joining us tonight is another park member, Steve Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| So I want to acknowledge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| I also would like to acknowledge Chief Ross, who's not here but is a representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| for his support and assistance in working with the police advisory review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=230)|
| 0:03:57| We continue to meet quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| We meet in all sectors of the city to provide access to the citizens of Knoxville so they have an opportunity to come out and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=239)|
| 0:04:09| We also, the park office, continue to be active in neighborhood watch associations as well as the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=249)|
| 0:04:21| And, again, we thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| And if there's any questions in regards to the report, I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| I believe council will take some time to review it and then give you a call or Ms. Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| But we certainly appreciate your service as chair of this committee and the full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| Thank you for serving in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| And we acknowledge, we also recognize the great work that Avis Reed and Lisa do, so we appreciate them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=283)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Continue the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Council, late this afternoon, so you may not have seen it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| the police department, Chief Roush and I announced that Captain Monty Houck is the new deputy chief, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=300)|
| 0:05:12| with Gus Paducis resigning, retiring from the city to go over to the school system for their security chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| That left a deputy chief position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| And so Chief Roush has appointed Captain Monty Houck to the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| He has graduated from the academy in 1989, so he's been with the city for quite a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| and I think you all probably know him and know the expertise that he brings to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| You'll see there probably will be an article in the paper tomorrow that will hit the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| but I just as a mayor want to congratulate now Deputy Chief Houck for moving into that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| I know he'll continue the great service that he has provided us for so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Also today, Secretary of State Trey Hargett visited my office along with Senator Becky Duncan Massey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=357)|
| 0:06:06| and our state reps Gloria Johnson and Harry Brooke, and they delivered a check for $5,000 for our archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| This is a check from the Secretary of State's office, and they provide grants to different cities throughout the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=373)|
| 0:06:21| and this $5,000 will allow us to preserve some of our archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| And Janet Wright from our information systems, Janet, you're up there somewhere, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| She applied for the grant, and she's the one responsible for making sure it gets spent appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| So we appreciate the Secretary of State for personally delivering that check to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| Also, I told him any time he had a big old check, you know, to come on by, that was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| Tomorrow, Wednesday the 15th, Mayor Burchett and I will hold a press conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| to announce a regional initiative to promote competitive airfares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| I mentioned this at the budget address a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| The Competitive Airfare Partnership, or CAP, is part of an Innovation Valley strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| to encourage business relocation and industrial development efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| Of course, that doesn't hurt us, either, those of us locally who want to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| The press conference will be held at 1.45 p.m. at McGee-Tyson Airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| on the second level outside the terminal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| So we hope to see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Also, at 10 a.m. on Friday, Chief Rausch and KPD will take part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| All of us will take part in a law enforcement memorial service to honor our fallen officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| Representatives from local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies are scheduled to attend the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| which will be at the Maricosta Plaza behind the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| This is a service that we observe each year during Peace Officer Memorial Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| And I know you all join with me in thanking our police officers for their sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| and invite the public to come and show their support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| So that's Friday at 10 a.m. at the Maricosta Plaza at the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| Also on Friday, right afterwards at 11 a.m., we'll be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| Well, actually, in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| And the IBM Smarter Cities team, who's been here three weeks, working with us and many of our partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| they will be delivering their analysis and their recommendations for how we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| As you all recall, we're trying to reduce the emergency utility bills that our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| many people in our community have each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| and a lot of good folks try and meet those needs and contribute to KUB for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| And we're trying to address that and coordinate that with the weatherization and energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| and upgrade resources that we have in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| And finally, this is National Public Works Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| And you all know that we have many hardworking employees, and it's always an honor for us to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=538)|
| 0:09:06| Tonight, as part of National Public Works Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| I'm going to present a proclamation to celebrate the employees and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| This is Christy Branscombe, who is our Senior Director of Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| for about three more weeks before she moves up to fill the big shoes of Eddie Maness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| She is here, and I'm going to thank you, Christy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| to pass that on to all of the employees that are here in the city for all that they do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| As you all know, public works is really the umbrella for four departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| engineering, which includes civil, traffic, and stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Public service, a department which has codes enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| also the building permits and inspections and zoning, and the parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| All of those are part of public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| We have 1,600 full and part-time employees within the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| and about a little more than 25 percent of them, about 460, are in that public works category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| So it's a big part of our operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| And those are the people that are out there day and night to keep our city going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| So on behalf of all the citizens of Knoxville, I'm going to read this and then hand it over to Christy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| but this is a proclamation on behalf of the people of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| to publicly recognize Public Works Week, whereas public works infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| facilities, and services are of vital importance to the health, safety, economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| and overall well-being of our community, and whereas the city of Knoxville's public works department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| includes building inspections and permits and zoning, engineering, parks and rec, and public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| and whereas these divisions together are responsible for setting and protecting development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| for our neighborhoods and businesses, maintaining our roadways and sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| providing parks and greenways for our citizens, planting trees, mowing grass, collecting yard waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| and generally ensuring the quality of life in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| and whereas these services could not be provided without the dedicated efforts of public works professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| engineers, and administrators at all levels of city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| and whereas the year 2013 marks the 53rd annual National Public Works Week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| sponsored by the American Public Works Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Now, therefore, I proclaim May 19th to 25th to be Public Works Week in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| and urge all citizens to join in this observance, and I'm going to walk over and give this to Christy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| and I think Christy's got a few comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Yeah, I'll share those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=704)|
| 0:12:04| Just briefly, I just need to mention we have our director of engineering, Jim Hagerman, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| I want to recognize him and his department for all of their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| They pave approximately 50 miles of city streets per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| maintain nearly 400 traffic signals on our city streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| and our building permits and inspections department need to acknowledge our director, Tom Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| who does a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| He and his staff manage eight inspections per day and do residential and commercial plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| For the public service department, I want to acknowledge David Brace, the director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| and Deputy Director Chad Weth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| They have 304 employees in the public service department and a budget of $33 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| And the parks and rec department, I want to acknowledge Joe Walsh as the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| We manage over 2,000 acres of parks in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| operate after-school programs at 12 different sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| and register over 150,000 participants in those activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| So I wanted to invite everyone to celebrate Public Works Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| We'll be hosting a cookout lunch for our Public Works employees from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| at Victor Ashe Park on May 20th and May 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| So if anyone would like to join us, please come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| Okay, that's the end of the mayor's report, so we'll go on to Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| I just want to announce that we'll be holding our annual budget hearings in this very room next Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| the 21st beginning at 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| We'll conclude as close to 5 o'clock as we can with the public forum at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| And folks are welcome to come in and hear the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| I'm sure it will be deep and robust at times even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| And I also want to just mention a festival occurred over the past weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| had a great crowd of about 1,200 folks despite some rain, intermittent rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| But it was still a very good time, great music, great craft vendors, food vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| and just a display of art and just a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| So for those of you who came to South Knoxville, we appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| and hope that you'll come back next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| And obviously if you weren't there, then come experience the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| It's a lot of fun, a very unique experience in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| A lot of great music there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Needless to say, there's been a few activities in the 2nd District the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| But one thing that I want to bring up, I talked to Chief Rausch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| and have talked to engineering that if there's any relief that can be given to North Shore and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| I know that the lights have been looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| And I did talk to the chief that, you know, we can get 110,000 people out of UT in a couple hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| but we've got traffic backed up from Kingston Pike up to almost Panera's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| And so if there's some way that we can get the police down there, especially during rush hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| needless to say, I'm getting a lot of telephone calls on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| I'm sure some of the rest of you have heard from some folks as far as the backup of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| So if there's something that can be done, you know, between the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| and maybe working on the signal arrows to turn left and right, that would certainly be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| The other thing is one of my favorite topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Mr. Swanson, could you give us an update on the shingles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| Well, it pleases the report that at both locations, both east and west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| the shingles are being ground and the piles are diminishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| It's sometimes a little difficult to tell that the piles are diminishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| because they were so substantial to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| But they are diminishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| They are being recycled and hopefully used to make a form of asphalt that can be used in the roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=937)|
| 0:15:47| So that is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| We are sending inspectors out on a regular basis to make sure that the work continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| It's not going as rapidly as we hoped that it would go, but it's going steadily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| And as long as it continues to go steadily, then everything will go well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| If not, then we'll have to take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Any other reports or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| We're on 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=975)|

| 0:16:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=989)|

| 0:16:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1017)|

| 0:17:30| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Mayor, members of Council, John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| I'm here on behalf of three clients who are in opposition to the closing of this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| I would like to ask for a postponement of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| Two weeks ago when we were here, the matter was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| Mr. King, normally in this process we first have the people that are supporting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| and then secondly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| I was going to ask for the postponement before we got into a discussion of the merits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| but it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| You're going to end up having a merits discussion I assume then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| I'd like to go ahead and have the discussion since a number of the parties are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| We'll call you back up in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you for trying to move it along, but I don't think that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| First I have ‑‑ it's a hard time reading this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| I think Scott Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| I have three people signed up for 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Hi, Mr. Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| I mean, yeah, 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Tony Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| I have Scott Bishop, Tony Cappiello, and Mary Lee Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| Am I reading this correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| And then Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| So, Mr. Bishop, you can come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| According to council rules, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| I'm going to set the little timer, so if you would please give your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| and I'll get the timer going for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Thanks for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| My name is Scott Bishop, 104 Westwood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| I do want to speak in favor of the road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| I both live and work in Bearden and have done one or both of those things for 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| and I'm really pretty strongly invested in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| I'm also here tonight wearing more than one hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| As a business owner a couple blocks away from this location, as someone who lives basically up the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| I'm also here representing the district in Bearden and the Bearden Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| all of whom are supporting the closure of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| It is not, as you know, tremendously uncommon for such property to be deeded over to developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1196)|
| 0:20:04| to enhance quality of development in neighborhoods where major ingress and egress is not affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| And since the developer has agreed to a narrower than the street is now easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| fronting Kingston Pike and on Homburg, there doesn't seem to be any real reason to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| It's also, I think, going to really enhance the Bearden Village plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| which is something the city has been working on for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| It's going to make the whole area much more pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| Having a street remain there cutting through will cut down on the potential for pedestrian traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| and we really, all of us who live and work there, want it to be more pedestrian friendly all up and down the Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| which is why we have advocated for traffic calming and a lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| And we also think that the way this property, which has not been exactly a visual asset to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| for a number of years, is going to be made one of the most attractive parts of Bearden altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| And I think that's really part of what this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| because closing the road gives the development a cohesion and a togetherness, a connectedness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| that will enhance that pedestrian friendly quality and make people much more likely to park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| and walk from shop to shop and business to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| And with any luck at all, that sort of thing will begin creeping out to other parts of Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| and making even more of it more pedestrian friendly in much the same way that the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| which now stretches all the way down to Westwood Road, has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| There will be much more pedestrian traffic on Sutherland because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| and we think this can do the same thing on the Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| There are still three other ready ways to get into Homburg Drive, either end of Homburg itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| and the traffic light at Mojica, which is especially handy if you're trying to turn left onto the Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| since there is no light at Ben Ashley Street and wouldn't be because it doesn't have a sufficient amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| The best left turn would be one block away at Mojica Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| Coming from the west to get onto Homburg at the Y there in front of Naples is a very simple operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1330)|
| 0:22:20| It's not where I would want to go to turn left, but again, I already addressed that because there is a traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| I just think the whole thing is a big plus for the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| I also think this is going to draw a lot more people to shop in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| which is an increase for merchants who pay business taxes, who pay sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| the increased property tax revenue that this sort of thing always brings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| because when you spiff up one part of the neighborhood, then somebody spiffs up another part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| and pretty soon you've got a whole lot of much nicer property that gets reappraised upwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| which the owners may not always care for, but which is always good for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| because if the city can't get sufficient tax revenue, it can't fund the things that everyone wants to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| And so this is a great way to help that process along just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| And I just can't see any reason why it would not be to the overall long-term benefit of both the Bearden neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| and the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| And I have not spoken to anyone in my neighborhood who opposes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| Of the 32 members of the district in Bearden, it's either 30 or 31 who support the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| The Bearden Council supports the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| I know MPC staff supported the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| I can't see any really compelling argument to not go ahead and do the closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1420)|
| 0:23:48| and that's really all I have to say unless someone wanted to ask me something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Thank you very much, Mr. Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Mr. Cappiello, state your name and address for the record, and I'll get the timer going for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| My name is Anthony Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I live at 3004 Kingston Pike with an office address in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| My family's been here since the 1940s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| and this particular property where I'm bringing anthropology has been owned by my family since 1960 for 53 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1457)|
| 0:24:27| I've provided each of you a packet, and I might just step through that real quickly to show you what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| That might answer a few questions, and then I'd be glad to give further history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| It starts with just a brief history of working with anthropology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| As you may know, anthropology is a subsidiary of Urban Outfitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| I've been working with this organization for over two years to attract them to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| and specifically to the Bearden community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| As I said in my summary, they typically look at a number of locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| It's their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| They looked at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| They looked at downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| They looked at West Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| But a tribute to them, they like unique buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| and they like kind of neighborhoods that have an artsy feel to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| So I kept working with them and trying to entice them to come to Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| and we situated on this particular building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| This, as I said, started two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| The next couple of pages you'll see in your packet is an article that was written by Forbes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| Anthropology is pretty close to the vest on their sales and their activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| But in this particular article, it stated that their average sales per square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| for an average store is $750 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| Taking that on the basis of the building that they'll be occupying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| this store should generate revenue of over $8 million per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| which should yield sales tax to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| and to the city in combination of over $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| And that's just this one store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| They act as the anchor to this whole development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| and the reason that I acquired additional property to build the shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| and to bring other quality tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| I have a laundry list of tenants that want to be next to Anthropology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| One of the reasons I know Mr. King is going to ask for continuance tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| I've held these people, a lot of these tenants, at bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Some of them are national retailers, regional franchisees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| and we've been delaying this process, and it's been a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| and I would like to give them either a yes or no tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| So I'm opposed to continuance further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| After the article about Anthropology, I've included a revised site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| which is a fold-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| This is a couple revisions we've made, and this, working with my site engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| we've come up with the idea of proposing a private easement to the three property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| This would be a perpetual easement only if all four parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| the ones that own this property and the ones that own those three properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| if they agreed to change it or make a change, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Otherwise, this roadway, basically it's a reduced roadway, would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| And what that does for me, it allows an additional 23 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| I am having, for Anthropology's purposes, to borrow 17 spaces on the backyard burger site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| We're very compact, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| In all of Bearden, it's difficult for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| So this would allow still access between Homburg and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| yet allow 21 spaces additional for parking for this whole development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| It really helps the development but does not limit access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| and it allows because it's a private easement for people to back into that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| Otherwise, they would not be able to if it were a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| The next few pages you'll see are just color renderings of the development I propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| Again, Anthropology loved the building that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| It took a lot of work just to make it structurally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| the integrity of the structure to hold this building for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| It used to be an old roller skating rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| One of the things they loved about it was that it had a barrel roof and kind of a Quonset hut look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| So I've taken that, as you flip through these pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| and I've applied that not only to the new shopping center but to the other existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| to give it a real sense of cohesion to make it feel like a community and an overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1731)|
| 0:29:02| Next, I know there's been some discussion about that there hasn't been really a precedence for closing roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| I've attached that I –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| There's 76.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Sorry, I didn't give you the warning, but –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Can we go ahead and give him a couple more minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Yeah, just wrap it up, just a couple more sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Yeah, the next you'll see precedence of 76 roadways, rights-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| that have been closed since 19 – I mean, excuse me, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Ms. Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1775)|
| 0:29:46| Please state your name and address for the record, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| I'm Mary Lee Fox, and I'm the owner of Gift Gourmet G&G Interiors in Bearden, 5508 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1792)|
| 0:30:04| We're in Cherokee Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| The Watkins family developed Cherokee Plaza about five years ago, and they had a great vision, I feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| to improve and revitalize the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| And as a business owner in a really very challenging economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| I think it's very important to take advantage of this opportunity we have to welcome a very well-known and popular retail store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1822)|
| 0:30:32| I feel like it will benefit everyone in the Bearden community to have anthropology there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| And I think it's great, and as Tony said, that they want to come to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| They could go to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| They could go to a mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| They could go to a lot of places, and I feel like it's a huge benefit to our area and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| And I think one of the main points that we are in favor of is being able to walk from store to store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| And this is just such an appealing idea, and we've all talked about it in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| They've talked about being able to walk from store to store, but that really enhances just convenience for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| It makes it so much more quaint and convenient, charming, and I think people really like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| And having plenty of parking and accessibility, I feel like those things are key because people are so about convenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| and they want to just park their car and be able to do lunch and shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| So I feel like that that is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| and I really don't think you can put a dollar amount on the value that it will add to this area, what they will bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1897)|
| 0:31:47| and just the financial resources and the things that they can add to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| And I do think, you know, as a high-end retail store, I mean, they are definitely competition for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| There's no doubt about that, and they have gifts and lots of things that we all have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| but I do feel like it's so critical to embrace them and make it good for everyone in our area for them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| And I think if you look at like Nashville and Chattanooga, they have these great areas where you can walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| and I feel like people go to those places as destination shopping areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| In Nashville, they have the Hill Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| You know, it's a great area like this where people can walk, and it's very pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| And Chattanooga, they've renovated Warehouse Row, and it's just so much more of a metropolitan great feel, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| And I do think that even if parts of this are inconvenient or uncomfortable for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| it's just important to realize how valuable it is and what a great benefit it is to have this here and be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1970)|
| 0:33:00| We're actually probably the furthest away from the walking distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| but hopefully this will be something that will just continue to grow in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| And it takes so many financial resources to be able to do something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| and besides that, it takes dedication and having a good vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| And I just feel like that we all need to look at what a great plan this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| and how much it will benefit all of us in not only in the Bearden community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| but in Knoxville and just in our whole city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| Now, Mr. King, you have five minutes, and please state your name and address for the record, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2019)|
| 0:33:58| And you're the only speaker for your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Is that correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| If anybody else is going to speak, I'm unaware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| And when we get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| I would like to observe that the proponents of this have used at least a total of 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| If I'm going to be the only speaker in opposition, am I limited to only five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| I have a lot to cover if, in fact, we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| My first purpose here is to request, as I said earlier, a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| When we were here two weeks ago, Mr. Capiello and Councilman Greene approached me the day of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2079)|
| 0:34:51| about a postponement, or maybe the day before, to which I agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| And at the time, I said to Mr. Seymour, I did not believe two weeks was enough time to grant us the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| to have discourse discussion about this matter, given the number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| Mr. Seymour's response was, let's go ahead and do it for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| and keep the heat on everybody to try to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| If we need to postpone it again, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| Starting at midweek last week, not having heard anything from Mr. Capiello as to what was being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| or what was to be discussed in the way of a, quote, compromise, close quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| not having heard anything, I started calling Mr. Seymour to get information about this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2144)|
| 0:35:55| for the purpose of discussing it with my client and being able to have some time to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| I got the proposal yesterday afternoon at about 2.30 at Councilman Greene's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| I had one client out of town and another just coming into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| I was able to get with them just yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2173)|
| 0:36:21| And I have not had time since those meetings, obviously, to have the kind of time I'd like to talk about this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2181)|
| 0:36:33| Fair is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| They had two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| I'd like to have two weeks to talk to my clients and evaluate this proposal about a joint permanent easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2197)|
| 0:36:50| because it carries with it liabilities and obligations on the parties that aren't currently there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2210)|
| 0:36:59| that they're going to be, if you will, responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| They need to fully understand and evaluate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| And also, if they're going to do it, we need to make sure that there are certain other things in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| that protect their interests as it relates to those legal obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| I had pointed some of those out in the meeting I had with Councilman Greene and Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| I think they acknowledged that those are issues and problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| We haven't had a chance to work through all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| And as further to the point, I got this yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| It's sort of like, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| This is the only option available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| I believe there are some other options or alternatives that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| that don't necessarily involve closing the road and yet give Mr. Cappiello everything he wants or needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| in order to go forward in his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| I'd like to explore those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Mr. Cappiello apparently has not, but I think if he's not going to, I'm willing to go see about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2280)|
| 0:38:10| So I'd like to have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Council, is there any motion to postpone or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| Do you want to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| So there's no motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| And, Mr. Delamope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| I was going to say let's give him five minutes to tell us what his opposition is and let's hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| I don't think we have a motion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| It's come this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I think it's worth hearing the other side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| So, Mr. King, I'm now going to start the timer again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| And you'll have up to five minutes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| Do I only have five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Well, I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| I approve to go ahead and give him ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Is that technically correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| That's a motion to amend the rules or to suspend the rules in order to allow ten minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| because the rules currently provide for five minutes per speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| But you can suspend the rules and give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| I'll hear a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I'll suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| And an extra five minutes will be a total of ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Mr. King, you have ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Before I start, I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| I won't start it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| You need a smaller box, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| He's got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| First are petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Are we starting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| I'm just going to pass this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| It's a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| You have a petition already, but this is in addition to the ones you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| That goes with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| And then here, Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| There are other copies in there I can give to each member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2405)|
| 0:40:22| We'll need some up here, too, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2422)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| You have an extra one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Do you want to amend your thing to seven minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2452)|
| 0:41:02| First, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Are we starting with ten minutes now, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| You ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| I guess so, but I may have to ask for leniency when we get to the end of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| Okay, well, we're starting your ten minutes now, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| We want to hear what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| If that happens, we're going to have to give the other side time, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Those in opposition to the closing of Ben Ashley Street, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2480)|
| 0:41:29| Madam Mayor and members of council, we're not here because we did something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2489)|
| 0:41:38| We built our improvements at substantial investment years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| I represent the owners of Southern Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| I represent the owners of Southern Management and Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| And I represent Dr. and Mrs. Phillips, beg your pardon, and their properties at the vet clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2510)|
| 0:42:02| And all those facilities, particularly Southern Market and the vet clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| were built based on a known and an existing network roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| and a reliance on those roads, including Ben Ashley Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| which I would note was named for a man whose many years of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| and political service was based on principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| But we're not here today to close Ben Ashley Street because that's the only way to get anthropology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| to come to Mr. Cappiello's development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| We now know that that assertion previously made by Mr. Cappiello at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| that assertion is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| We're not here tonight to close Ben Ashley Street because that's the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| that Mr. Cappiello can develop the rest of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| He can develop the remainder and still leave Ben Ashley Street open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| We're not here because of the location of a pie shop that he wanted to have a drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| and thus necessitate the close of Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| That's been changed, and we no longer have a drive-through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| When the Sexton's built their property, Southern Market, they wanted a 10,000-square-foot building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| but they had to be reduced because there was not sufficient parking available to have a building of that size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| so they reduced it to 8,300 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| Mr. Cappiello could do that if, in fact, he has a shortage of parking spaces, and I respectfully think he does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2613)|
| 0:43:44| He just doesn't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| What he wants to do is the development size that he wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| and I submit even at that, for what he wants, it can still be done without closing Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| I can illustrate, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| It's going to be a little hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| But, for example, this is his proposed the shaded area is his proposed joint permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2652)|
| 0:44:23| Currently, the boundary of Ben Ashley Street is that dark line right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| and the outside edge or the, if you will, the eastern edge of the shaded area that he shows as that permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| That's the current street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| And I respectfully submit that he can leave that street open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| lose some of his parking spaces that currently show, in essence, in the street, and yet retain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2687)|
| 0:44:57| and I believe a request to city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| their justification for them to permit diagonal parking on a portion of this property and the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2700)|
| 0:45:13| permit diagonal parking and, for that matter, parallel parking on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| What I'm saying is you can, if you wanted to, you could keep the nine spaces on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2720)|
| 0:45:43| There's nine on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2743)|
| 0:45:56| I'm looking at it upside down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2756)|
| 0:46:20| There's 11 on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| Nine on the west side, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Nine on the east, 11 on the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2786)|
| 0:46:38| And you wind up still having more parking spaces than is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| If you keep the nine on the west side and lose everything, I beg your pardon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2803)|
| 0:46:53| keep the nine on the east side and lose everything on the west side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| you still wind up with a shortage of parking spaces of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| And given that, that is clearly a situation where I believe you would get a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| to reduce the required number of spaces by two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| This is what I wanted to explore because I believe the city engineering for a street such as Ben Ashley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| can support diagonal parking that is laid out, that leaves him those parking spaces and solves his problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2843)|
| 0:47:35| I'm willing to go and talk to city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| I believe that they would approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| It's not that heavily a traveled street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| It's much heavier than they would like you to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| But I believe that can be done, and I would propose to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| and unfortunately I'm not given the time to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| so it's an issue of we're going to close the street or we're not going to close the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| I submit to you that the development can be done without closing the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| and it can be done without causing him any difficulty as far as the number of parking spaces he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2882)|
| 0:48:14| The reason he is ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Sir, there's three minutes just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Gee whiz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| We're not here today because we're obstructionists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| I'm speaking on behalf of my clients and the public's rights to the utilization of a public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| This issue was thrust upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| We didn't seek it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| The reason that this is being sought is, I mean, if you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| it's not there's no compelling public purpose or interest to be served by closing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| Now it's not even required for his private purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| We're here because Mr. Cappiello wants the city to give him public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| And I have said before, and I say again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| that this request is nothing more than a transfer of wealth from the public domain to the private interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| or the increase in value to one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| I've talked about this as a valuable piece of property, and I've said it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| I'll say it again, but it doesn't matter so much what I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| We got an appraiser, an MAI appraiser, Ken Woodford, well-known in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| He does a lot of appraisals for this city and the county and the state, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| And I asked him to find out what the value of this piece of property is that he's asking, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| be closed and transferred to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| His appraisal, which we'll distribute to you now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| tells us that the property that he's asking you to transfer to him by this vote is worth $235,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2984)|
| 0:49:53| It's about a 70-page appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| but it has some good points in it about the fact that the transfer of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=2995)|
| 0:50:04| and the potential utilization of this property by someone can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| and how it worked or could work to the detriment of the surrounding property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| including the businesses along Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Closing the road hurts my clients and helps Mr. Cappiello to the tune of $235,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3016)|
| 0:50:25| I want to talk about, you know, I'm going to pass you up some information on the traffic counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| but I believe it will demonstrate really clearly that city's numbers are in excess of 300 cars a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| I've got some other photos that I want to give you that show the traffic situation at Mohican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| where trucks, service trucks, park in the street and block the street there for deliveries to those businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| which creates a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| You're talking about adding more traffic to that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| I would want to close by making ---- I hate to read law books, but I'm forced to sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3057)|
| 0:51:08| I'll tell counsel we've got like five seconds left, so what is your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| Go ahead and let him finish, Mayor, or suspend the rules so he can finish or give him five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| What is it, Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Whatever you want to do, if you suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Suspend the rules and add some time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| How much time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Five more minutes, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| I would bring the total to 15 for his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| I'm going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| So is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Sir, counsel has given you five more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| I have likened what is being proposed here as the reverse side of the coin to condemnation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| and that's the taking of private property and public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| What we're doing here is the reverse side of the coin, taking private property and giving it over to private use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| But so far as you all know, in order for any governmental entity to take property, it has to be by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3117)|
| 0:52:07| It must be for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| And we hear a lot of the discussion here tonight about increased property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| and more jobs and this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Let me read you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| There was a case up in the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| It was decided about condemnation, and there was a flurry of activity, and statutes were amended about condemnation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| and it was in Tennessee, and the statute now reads public use being defined 2917.102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3147)|
| 0:52:36| Public use shall not include either private use or benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| or the indirect public benefits resulting from private economic development and private commercial enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| including increased tax revenue and increased employment opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| And then it gives some exceptions to that, none of which apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| In essence, they're saying public use, which is what has to be there in order for you to exercise this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| public use doesn't include private use or benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| or indirect public benefits resulting from private economic activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| And I suggest to you that that's precisely what is occurring here on the reverse side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| You're taking public property and turning it over to a private individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| There is no public purpose for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| There is no public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| You're doing it for that private person's benefit and for the wrong reasons that are not authorized by statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| when you start talking about public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| Now, I want to go ahead and pass up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| Ken, if you'll come down here, I'll get them for you, find them for you, and let you pass them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3226)|
| 0:53:57| How many of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Who's this been for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3239)|
| 0:54:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3269)|
| 0:54:42| You need to be talking because your time is ticking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| The photos that I passed up are photos of the truck situation I was talking about on Mohegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| It demonstrates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| This is a request made by Mr. Redback, who's here in opposition to this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| and he's well familiar with that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3296)|
| 0:55:06| As I said, I've got the traffic counts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| I've got the photos there that were a traffic situation at Mohegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| Nine businesses, two restaurants to be served by service vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| who utilize the street in order to make their deliveries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| All you're doing is adding more traffic to that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Now, I said that there's no public purpose for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3324)|
| 0:55:32| It started out with anthropology wasn't going to come unless the street got closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| That turned out not to be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| And then there was an issue about having a rental on a pie shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| Now that has turned out not to be the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| And the truth of it is parking is not really an issue either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| It's just the fact that Mr. Capiello wants this transfer of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| I want to pass up some pictures now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| The first two pictures are the two buildings that are going to be improved, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3365)|
| 0:56:13| The first two pictures are the buildings that will be improved by your transfer of $235,000 worth of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| And the last two pictures that you get, put them all together, Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| They all go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| The first two, look at them and pass them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| The first two are the buildings that will be benefited by this $235,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| and the last two buildings being the southern market as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| and the vet clinic as an example of properties that will be damaged or reduced in value by this transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3401)|
| 0:56:53| I think it's a startling comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| Mr. King, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| I'll close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Give me about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I would ask is it to be the public policy of this city that its public property is to be utilized to fund a private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3421)|
| 0:57:11| to the detriment of others, others who have made their investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| and operate their business based upon features that are a part of the public domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| This is the same as taking property or turning property over to private individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| There is no public purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| That is not to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| A vote to close this street is nothing more than a vote to give Mr. Capiello a $235,000 grant or subsidy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3451)|
| 0:57:41| because he wants it no matter what, and that's why we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| I would ask that you oppose the closing of Ben Axley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| And now, by council rules, the appellants get a two-minute rebuttal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| Let's see if we can stick to actual timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| You ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| I will, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902, here on behalf of Mr. Capiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3484)|
| 0:58:13| To clarify the record, we are not proposing a joint and permanent easement, as Mr. King has repeatedly said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| We are proposing a private easement roughly located where the existing road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| We would make his clients the beneficiary of that easement so that it could not be closed without their acquiescence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3506)|
| 0:58:37| We have also proposed sidewalks along Homburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| We have proposed a crosswalk along Homburg, across Homburg Drive from the Southern Market to Mr. Capiello's center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3521)|
| 0:58:51| These are all items that would have to be worked out, but they are, have been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| The proposal initially to consider an easement such as Mr. Capiello has proposed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| was presented at a meeting on April 19, 2013, to Mr. King's clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3543)|
| 0:59:10| He and several of his clients there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| We were told that there would be no compromise that would involve the closure of Ben Ashley Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| and we have heard nothing since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| In closing, Mr. Capiello's proposal and this request is supported by people throughout Bearden and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3565)|
| 0:59:35| The business community in Bearden overwhelmingly supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| That is the Bearden District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| It was near unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Neighborhood groups in Bearden represented by the Bearden Council support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| Mr. Capiello has a petition that he will submit signed by numerous people who support this road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3590)|
| 1:00:00| And finally, a number of years ago, the Bearden Village Plan was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| in consultation between the Metropolitan Planning Commission, neighborhood groups, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| And one of the major proposals for that was to make Bearden walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| And that's what Mr. Capiello's proposal is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| I suggest or submit that it's fully in accord with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| Now, we are now going to have questions and discussion from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| And before we do so, just thinking ahead here, I want to – there are some people in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| Four people have signed up to speak to 11L, which is about the UT – the bus shelters on UT property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3638)|
| 1:00:49| Three said they were against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| The other person didn't indicate if they were for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| So if those people would maybe – by council rules, you can have three people speaking up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| So if the four of you, if you're all against it, if you would get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| and figure out who your three speakers are, that will help us move it along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| just giving you some advance notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| That's the bus shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Do I need to say who those are that signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| That's Hubert Smith, Jim Jennings, Rick Roach, and Umoja Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3676)|
| 1:01:25| If you all would get together and figure out your three speakers, if you were all opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| I can't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Mr. Roach, I can't tell what your position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Moving right along, it's now time for council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| Needless to say, this has been a trying couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| and I think both parties are passionate about what it is that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| One of the problems that I've had is to really fully understand what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3714)|
| 1:02:01| We have a situation where we have a developer who has requested that we close a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3721)|
| 1:02:09| The city road will be turned over to him for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| The property, 50 feet wide and whatever the extension is there, will then go into the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| The one thing that I have heard from a number of people is the fact that we're beginning to have unified development areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| instead of piecemeal through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| I think that one of the things that has been discussed in the last couple of weeks is that he has agreed to have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3749)|
| 1:02:38| This is what I've heard all along is that we need the access through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| What I've heard lately and even as of today, and I think Mr. King addressed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| that it seems to me that what's really coming out is the real problem is people are having heartburn over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| giving property to a developer in order to enhance his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| I think one of the things that we have to look at is that we have to look at not only today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| but we have to look at the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Tony has met with, I know, the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| He's met with representatives from the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| He came with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| From that plan, he has agreed to sidewalks all along Homburg, which weren't there or not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| He's agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| He's agreed to a crossover from his parking facility to Southern Markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| He's agreed to allow them to continue to use their parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| He's agreed also, maybe under a little forced pressure from some of us, to landscape the entrance on that easement that he's willing to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3811)|
| 1:03:40| so that not only does it define where the interest is, but it makes it a much more attractive way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| not only to go into his development, but also to get to Southern Markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| He's also agreed to, with his 25-foot permanent easement, that that stays with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3831)|
| 1:03:59| Private easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Private easement, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| And that if for some reason he sells the property or whatever, that easement stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| And so the access, which has been talked about off and on for the last couple of weeks, will stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3846)|
| 1:04:13| I think that when we look at the Bearden area and we look at what's happening along Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| some of the developments that have occurred, I think we're seeing a great enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| I understand what some folks are saying as far as the anthropology and what the news media had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| but I think that what we're looking at is something far beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| We're looking at what parking is available and how we can enhance that particular piece of property with additional buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| I had personally asked Tony whether or not they could do away with the drive-up window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| I felt that that was some concern that not only did it take away parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| but it also, to me, it caused a safety factor there with the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| The other thing is that I think that some of the – I'm not sure that – I guess the real question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| I'm not sure there's a compromise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| I know that all the e-mails that I've received and the telephone conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| and even some of the information that we've received tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| that in what little bit of dealings that I've had with the individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| I think some people are dead set that the road stays open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| and I think some people are dead set that the road be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| And so I think it's going to be up to us to look at Bearden, look at the future of Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| look at what this development does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| and I think we have to get beyond the emotional aspect of what's happened in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| I know that I've kind of chastised both lawyers for dragging their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| I've also chastised Tony for the fact that he now realizes that he should have talked to these people long before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| that ever came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| You know, we're put in the position where we have to split the baby, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| and this is really something that neighbors could have done ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| I've gotten a number of e-mails, a number of phone calls, both in support and in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| Those in support say, look, you know, you're going to have a business like anthropology there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| It's going to attract other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| We ought to figure out some way that we can unify this development and make it workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| A good friend of mine who is with SACS mentioned to me, called up and said, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| you know, once you have anthropology there and once you have a decent parking area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| you're going to attract other high-end people to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Right now, I think Bearden's on a boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| There's a lot of fantastic shops that are in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| There are a lot of good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Sometimes I equate the Bearden area to the Buckhead of Atlanta in terms of where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| and where we're headed with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| I find that I also know being in this position, you can't make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| And so there are going to be some unhappy people and there's going to be some happy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| But I really think that for the future of Bearden, for the future of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| I think that with his commitment to add sidewalks to his total development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| I think we as a city have an opportunity to continue the sidewalks in the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| and really take the Bearden plan and make it what it was meant to be, which is a walkable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| I notice that there's some other business folks out there that are in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| and it's going to be fantastic to be able to walk from one development to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| And so I'm going to support the closure of this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| I think it's in the best interest for the future of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| I think that what it's going to do to that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| and the kind of situation it's going to bring with future businesses, that that's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| So I feel very strongly that we ought to move ahead on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| As far as postponement, I think that I don't see a solution to the two parties in terms of where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| at least where they were as of yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| Are you making a motion at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Now, I understand if you're supporting this, the proper motion is to approve the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| and pass the ordinance on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| My counselor is nodding yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| That's what he told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| So you're passing it on to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Is there a second at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| I'll second that if it has the private easement as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4098)|
| 1:08:27| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| I need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| There really would not be an appropriate amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| That's going to be between private parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| It's not going to be between the city is not going to enforce such an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| and that would really not be an appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| What we have before us is an appeal of the denial of MPC of the closure of the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| and the outcome of that appeal would be the closure of the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| but it would not be appropriate to append to that a requirement of some type of private easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| Could there be a second motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Could there be a second motion after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| That's what I'm trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Is there a way we can make sure that that occurs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| I second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Yeah, if you don't pass it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| That would be one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Make sure that that is accomplished before you pass it on second reading would be a way to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| Your attorney has come up with the right answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| Yeah, I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| So you're keeping the second then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| George is seconding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| George is seconding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| I'll just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| So, but we can go on record that says that there will be a private easement on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4189)|
| 1:09:59| Sidewalks will be included, crosswalk, these type of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| And also, by the way, he has agreed to remove the billboard in seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| Open the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| You're speaking on the record right now, but you cannot make that part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| The motion will be to approve the appeal and adopt the ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| And then, consistent with your attorney's advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| then you wait until those other things are accomplished before you decide to pass it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| So it may not be in two weeks when you pass it on second reading, if you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Anything else, Councilman Gray, at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| I'm just going to walk around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Councilman Stanton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| As many of you know, I work with Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| We work for the same law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| So due to the professional conflict of interest, I'm not going to be voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| I'll be abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Well, this has been a very interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| All of us have had dozens and dozens of e-mails and phone calls about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| I guess I'm troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| I like the idea of this planned development as looking attractive, at least as sketched by the artist and architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4268)|
| 1:11:16| But I'm troubled that we're favoring one citizen over another, and that really troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| These other businesses were on Homburg and rely to some degree on road access and on visual, what, availability from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4282)|
| 1:11:34| And it strikes me a little unfair in the sense that we've had road closures before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| but typically it's into one or two persons' property and it dead ends there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| and we close the road and we give each side to the middle of the right-of-way back their fee without the easement of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| except sometimes we save utilities or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| But this is a situation where it is a road to somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| Now, there's been an argument it's not a heavily used road, but it is a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| I can foresee a couple things happening down the line that would be troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| One is, you know, two years from now anthropology says, hey, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| We're not making enough money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| We're going to Atlanta or some other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| And we have no control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| This isn't the building for a lifetime of anthropology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| It's a business that picks that as a potential business site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| But it may not be there, so it may not be the be-all and end-all that they would like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| On the other hand, if it happens, I'm sure it would do some good to the business in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| And I can understand that, and I can understand the efforts to pull this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| The second thing that troubles me is if it really is that hard to make a left turn onto Kingston Pike without going back down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4357)|
| 1:12:45| what is the side street there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Yeah, go to the side street where there's a traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| You're going to be at the Maples intersection and in five years' time you're going to be appropriating a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| to put a traffic light and straighten out the curve there so people have better visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| I mean, it's going to put the burden back on the city to deal with traffic if this occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| So I'm troubled that as nice as this sounds, we're getting in over our head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| I think the proposal that we heard in the audience to take the sting out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| to remove the other building that's there, the pie place, to give them some visibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| to narrow the road to an easement, but it still gets folks in and out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| That has some interest because now we're not cutting off folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| but apparently they're either not in a position to agree to that now or they don't want to agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| But, again, I come back to I'm troubled that we're favoring one citizen over others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| And it doesn't seem right to me that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| It seems to me that we're picking winners and losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| And people who have established businesses, I saw the photographs of the doctor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| and the art supply place in Southern Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| They have a legitimate claim to wanting decent access that's been there since 1927 or 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| So I think I'm opposed to it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| I was tempted to go with the postponement, but I'm not sure there's a will for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| But I certainly would like to see a compromise and all of these things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| And it turns out wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| That may be Pollyanna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| Maybe we'll never get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| But I'm going to vote against it if we have to decide today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| I agree with Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| I really wish that this could be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| I think what Mr. King presented as far as the parking situation made a lot of sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4471)|
| 1:14:39| I met with Mr. Cappiello down there Saturday, and I was excited when, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| when he started talking about the easement and what have you, and then I found out the liability of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| And I'm like, well, you know, I just can't get over that right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| And, you know, the folks, the other folks that are affected bought, built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| and leased property based on that current market, you know, as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| And to go in and change that after the fact, I've got a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| I just don't think that that's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| Because all this is going to happen regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| I don't really understand what the argument is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| It's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| And my hat's off to the developer for getting a great company like this and the other vision that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| It's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| It's great for Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| I don't think there's anybody up here that's against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| It's this roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| It's not that we're against the development, and the development's going to happen regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| So, to put everybody else at a hardship over three or four parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| and totally, you know, not totally change their business plan and the way people access them, I just can't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4543)|
| 1:15:53| And, again, I wish we could go back and consider a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| and let the attorneys get around the table and talk about the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| But, you know, I don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Actually, that is a valid motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| You can make it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| I want to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Well, like everyone else, I've got more e-mails and more phone calls about this issue than anything else in my 18-month tenure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4574)|
| 1:16:23| And there's a lot of pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| Of course, I live in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| I'm in the real estate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| I've studied this request a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| It's not about one particular tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| It's never been about one particular tenant for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| It's about the long-term benefit for Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| and the way it would enhance the development of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| One tenant, you can't make a decision such as this for one tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| I think the compromise that's been reached here with keeping the 25-foot easement is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| And the sidewalks, he's adding back quite a bit of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| I guess my question, really my primary question is going to go to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| Tell me a little bit more about this easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| You say private easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| Mr. King referred to it as a joint permanent easement with shared liabilities to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| Are you proposing shared liabilities to that with the property owners or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| It's not a joint permanent easement because that has legal significance under the city's subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| We proposed a private easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| It's basically where part of the roadway is now connecting Kingston Pike and Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| To ensure that Mr. Cappiello could not unilaterally close that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4657)|
| 1:17:44| we offered to give them, make one or more of those property owners a beneficiary of that easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4664)|
| 1:17:54| so that it would require their permission and legal consent before it could be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| They say, well, if somebody has an accident on the road or on the easement, we could potentially be liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4680)|
| 1:18:08| Somebody could always sue you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| I was taught the first day in law school you can sue the Bishop of Rome in Rome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| But that doesn't mean you're going to get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| We have easements like this all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| West Town Mall, most shopping centers, more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| I know a recent development of Mr. Cappiello's in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| There were easements like this that were not public roads that benefited several properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| I can't say these people are never going to get sued over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| I assume they carry insurance like most business people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4723)|
| 1:18:50| And that's how you insure against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| You're going to get sued for too many lawyers out there, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| Well, I get the cross easement, the cross drive and ingress and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| But this connects two public streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| I don't know how you could give them, you could make them a beneficiary of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| which is going to tie them into some liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| I mean, if you can, I'm going to go back and say that if you're going to work, they would have to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| And I would think you would end up in a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| I would then be in favor of postponement if you're going to have to draft an agreement that they would have to agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| They don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Mr. Cappiello is firmly committed to the dedication of this easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4771)|
| 1:19:39| What assurances do we have as the city of Knoxville that we're going to have that easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| and they're going to have the parking lot or the sidewalks and the crosswalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| I mean, that's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| He can give you his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| I will work, if you approve Councilman Grieve's motion, I will work on the assurances between now and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4791)|
| 1:19:59| Right now, you have his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| He's been talking about this for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| I think every development he has done, he has performed all of his obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| and then some without legal obligations to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| But I can certainly work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| And I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| I think, like Charles Swanson said, we have the second reading to get more comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| And it's a tough call, but I'm in support of closing Ben Ashley Road for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| My only question about the postponement, what would the postponement accomplish at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4835)|
| 1:20:43| Both of you all have met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| I think Mr. King wanted to discuss with his people further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| but I'm not sure what a postponement would accomplish at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| And I don't know who to address that to, I guess, other than Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4855)|
| 1:21:09| Right there is where that's one boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| And that's the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4875)|
| 1:21:26| This is the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| What I suggest to you is that there is no discussion on both sides of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| There's no discussion to the engineers about permitting that parking on both sides of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4897)|
| 1:21:48| But I believe to the engineers that they can find a place to get it for permitting that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4908)|
| 1:21:56| On the other side of that road, that's where we've got that side of the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| It's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| On the other side of the street, on this avenue, that's where we've got the six-zone side of the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4923)|
| 1:22:11| And I believe that you would listen to the proposal to have parallel parking along that avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4931)|
| 1:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| And you get all the parking that he needs or is required to have, and you haven't closed the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4940)|
| 1:22:28| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| I wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| I get a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| The proposal that they gave us or discussed back in April doesn't have this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| It doesn't even have the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| It has two access to each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| It has this access and this access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| The plan then was the same date as this plan is, which I received yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4973)|
| 1:23:03| November of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| Obviously, it's only a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| Yes, I did propose a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| When they said they proposed or suggested a easement at that time, it was about that much discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=4995)|
| 1:23:29| Frankly, the plan is showing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| And as I said, I believe that you don't have to close the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5013)|
| 1:23:41| You have to feel that the parking space is connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| This is a piece of apple pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| It's off to another building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| It's no different than the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| You walk through it and look at this belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| Anywhere anybody walks from one shop to the other is going to be in that hill or over here on the other side of the belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5045)|
| 1:24:13| And everything in between is parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| I'm going to be real honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| I'm extremely disappointed tonight that there wasn't some kind of an agreement with the two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| When we left here two weeks ago and the suggestion was that the two sides get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| I really expected to come back with something that was an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| I think I've talked to both attorneys more than once and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| have we all hugged and said this is great and are we moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| And I keep getting the answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| I'm disturbed about a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| And one of them has to do, as this development was getting underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| that there were missteps from the beginning that council is now being asked to redirect or straighten out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5097)|
| 1:25:08| So I would not support, I don't think, a postponement because I'm pretty convinced from the e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| and having talked with attorneys on both sides that there's not going to be a compromise that would be agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5114)|
| 1:25:25| And I would not support a postponement if that comes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| Mr. Seymour, I'd like just your thoughts on Mr. King's parking or Mr. Cappiello, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5134)|
| 1:25:44| May I turn that over to Mr. Cappiello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| I am an attorney, not a real estate developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| As I understand it, what he's proposing to go to parallel parking causes a couple different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5155)|
| 1:26:02| For every two spaces that are perpendicular to the road, I can get one parallel space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| Second of all, in my understanding and research, and I don't mean any disrespect whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| but this is a woman's store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Women do not like parallel parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| I've had that told to me by retailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| It's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| Anyway, I am trying to create consensus and a uniform development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| And that is why I'm asking for the road to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| I'm sorry if that statement offended someone, but it's just men don't like it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| Mayor, if I can interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| Go right ahead, Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| We looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| And basically it goes from 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| It goes from 21 spaces down to 11 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| If you if you create the parallel parking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| I think that's what that's what we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Is there any advice, Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| OK, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| So what would we be short parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| I mean, if 11, what was 11 spots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| And then depending on how you dress and ingress the parking lot, according to what they showed me the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| the maps that 110 were required, you're saying there's less than 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| They said they had 120 showing, but they had 110 as a requirement on their chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5250)|
| 1:27:41| One hundred and ten spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| I'm looking at the fold out as three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| One hundred and ten spaces required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| 120 provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| So we had 10 extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| If you only if you lose 11, you're one short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| You ought to be able to kiss up to the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| That's not how decisions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| We had a rational argument why there should be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| That's a load of humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Mayor George's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| Are you responding to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| Hey, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| You really need to speak into the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| There's a world out there that's listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| I'll hold it over here, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| What I was suggesting was that you leave the nine diagonal parking spaces along the street on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5311)|
| 1:29:00| and use your parallel parking on the other side where you have 12 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| You would then get six parallel parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| Leave the nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| You still are over the required parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| That wouldn't involve closing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| Now, I don't know whether city engineering would go along with that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| I'd like to discuss it with them and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| From day one, we've asked them to come to us with a proposal that did not include closing Ben Ashley Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| that we would work with them any way we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| Just let's take a look at that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| It's never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| And once again, as of yesterday, I'm told this is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| This is our compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| I believe there's a way to do this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| It's laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| I believe it can be done with the street there just as easily as we can do it by creating an easement and closing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5397)|
| 1:30:05| I'd like to see that pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| I'd like to have that opportunity to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| And since it's not on the table, again, I would ask that you vote no on the motion to close Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5409)|
| 1:30:21| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Mayor, first of all, Brenda, I apologize for not coming back with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| But I firmly believe that when I was told by some of the folks at Southern Markets, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| we'll do anything but close that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| And then I hear from the developer side, we'll do anything, but we've got to close the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| So, I mean, we do have a stalemate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| I do think that, you know, we talk about they're talking about that we're giving a piece of property to a developer to enhance the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| But we also, we as a group, have given TIFs and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| We've helped the city in a number of different ways to develop properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| And so I don't see that much difference here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| I think that what we need to do is we need to get out of the emotional aspect of what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| and look to see that there are areas in Bearden that are becoming developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| They're becoming nicer than what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| We're taking old, run-down buildings and motels and converting those into a much nicer spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5477)|
| 1:31:24| We've got to start some place to make Bearden walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| This developer is willing to take a whole side of Homburg and put a sidewalk in, and that's a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| Now, granted, we don't have sidewalks behind Bennett's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| and we don't have sidewalks behind some other parking lots up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| but maybe that's something that we as a city can look at to help Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| But we have a developer who's willing not only to add those sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| but we talked to him about there may be some repair of sidewalks on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| I think one thing, and I asked the legal counsel, if we pass this on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5514)|
| 1:32:01| can we instruct the developer to maybe also not only talk with those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5521)|
| 1:32:08| but can we also instruct him to make sure that what he's talking about is done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| Sure, you can instruct him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| It won't be part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| But he can come back to us on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| If we pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Maybe we have the opportunity also for the two groups to get together during this time, you know, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| And you can definitely change your vote between first and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| There are places in the city where this situation exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| where you have a private road that essentially dissects a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| I would say, using my own self as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| I would say that the difference the way vehicular traffic would approach that as a road would be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| than as a driver would approach it through a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| Through a parking lot, you can have speed bumps that you can't have on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| When you see a yellow line down the middle of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| when you see the delineation where it's not the same pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| it would cause people to not regard it as a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| They'll regard it as a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| And I don't think it's not the best for creating the walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| Yes, visually it will look the same in regards to being able to drive back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| But I can tell you that I think in order to create the best long-term for the benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| I still think it's the best thing to making it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| Well, just to be clear, what I was talking about, walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| is I'm referring to his sidewalks that he's adding on Homburg to be able to tie the whole Homburg area together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| But at Central Baptist Church, you have this same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| And that road, I mean, it's got a double yellow line down through the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| And I'd travel that road faster than I would if it was in a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| And I think that's not for safety, you know, to have it as a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| There's a big difference between what he's compromised, and he didn't have to offer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| This is a pretty big compromise for him to offer that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| So it is a compromise, and sidewalks is certainly a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| But there's a big difference between being a road and how he can deal with it in his easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| And I think it's a safer situation for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| And I think if you look at the drawings, you can still see that you do have that visibility from Kingston Pike to their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| Visibility corridor is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| So on the table, we have a motion to approve the appeal and pass the ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| Are you all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| I'm going to ask for a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5689)|

| 1:35:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Councilman Stairs abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5713)|
| 1:35:21| The motion, it's a five yes, three no, and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| So the motion does pass, and this moves on then to second reading, which will be in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5725)|
| 1:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| Thank you all who were here and participated in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| We are now on to 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| 11A, a resolution to honor the memory of Jimmy Thacker Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| and to express council's condolences to his family upon the occasion of his passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5748)|
| 1:36:00| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| I just wanted to add that I would like to add my name to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| Maybe the others would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| I didn't have an opportunity, or at least I didn't observe an opportunity to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| and I certainly think it's a great thing that we're going to honor Mr. Thacker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| So I'd like to join the motion as a sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| We will add your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| I wanted to, if it's all right with council, to read some of the highlights of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| I did attend the funeral and gave some remarks on behalf of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| and his widow asked if we had anything prepared, which we did not at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| But I would like to read a few highlights of this resolution if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| Go right ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Whereas Mr. Jimmy Thacker passed away on April 30, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5807)|
| 1:36:54| and whereas Mr. Thacker was a graduate of Allen University and received his Bachelor of Science degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| and whereas Mr. Thacker further obtained a Master's of Science Administration at Atlanta University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| and whereas Mr. Thacker spent almost half a century in the education profession as a teacher, coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5827)|
| 1:37:16| professor, and administrator, including serving as principal at Austin East High School from 1971 to 81,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5836)|
| 1:37:26| and whereas Mr. Thacker also was a generous donor of his time with various organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5846)|
| 1:37:34| whereas Mr. Thacker will be deeply missed by the members of his family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| as well as the thousands of people he touched through his long and influential life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5859)|
| 1:37:46| And I would like to add on my own that certainly Mr. Thacker had a great influence on this community as an educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5866)|
| 1:37:55| and I don't see any members of his family here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| I don't think any of them were here, but maybe they may be watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| And we will send the resolution to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| I just want to add, he's also a great neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| He and Brenda were neighbors of mine when I lived in the River Shore subdivision for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| So, Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Yeah, I, too, would like to be added to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| I apparently did not include myself and certainly want to be a part of that acknowledgement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| So all of Council will be included on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| Item 11B, a resolution respectfully requesting pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated 13.3.304.B.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5913)|
| 1:38:40| the Metropolitan Planning Commission to consider and make a recommendation to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| regarding the possible change to the zoning classification of the two parcels located at the north side of Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5925)|
| 1:38:53| east side of Francis Road, and further known as 106KB02602 and 106KB02603,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5933)|
| 1:39:03| located in the City of Knoxville to Neighborhood Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| and to the extent required, amending the one-year comprehensive development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| and zoning plan for the City of Knoxville to amend the classification of all city property if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| Requested by Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Councilman Palmer, we have two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Would you like to hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| We have Mr. Seymour and Mr. Hugh Holt, and we're going to try and get back to the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5966)|
| 1:39:35| Very, very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| Actually, we would request on behalf of Knox County that this be amended to delete the second parcel from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5985)|
| 1:39:56| and leave that as office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| That's the parcel people refer to as the old house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| It's parcel 02603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| Knox County has declared this property surplus, wishes to auction it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| The first parcel, 02602, is at the corner of Francis and Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6012)|
| 1:40:21| Knox County will sell that property at public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| It has four users already who are interested in that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6025)|
| 1:40:32| and that is before any public interest has been expressed in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| We would respectfully request that City Council send that parcel back to MPC for study on an amendment to the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6037)|
| 1:40:46| and the zoning on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Is that all you have, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| We also have Mr. Holt, the Purchasing Director for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Mr. Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Hugh Holt, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| I just got on the list to be here in case any of the Councilmembers had any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| but obviously I work for Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| He didn't want to come himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| He's busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| These two parcels of property are adjacent to Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| Directly on one corner is a Delta Express that was a shell three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| Across the street from this property is Middlebrook United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| and then diagonally is a piece of property that is in some state of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| but it's my understanding that it is about to be developed into a retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| The larger parcel that we're asking MPC to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| has been a piece of property that's been in somewhat dispute about who really owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| Because it's adjacent to Bearden Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| the folks at Bearden Middle School and the school district thought they owned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| But when the records were checked, that was county land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| During the ten years that I've been looking at that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| it's primarily been used for people to put illegal signs advertising their soccer league| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| or some other kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| So to me, this would be an improvement to have something on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| Or a political campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| No, there were not political signs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| Certainly not mine, because I have a real pet peeve about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| But back to this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| there were signs posted by MPC when this was first considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| and proposed by the county several weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| And they were well displayed because I have chastised MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| for hiding those signs in the weeds at the back of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| But these were very prominent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| But apparently the folks at Bearden Middle were not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| They contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| I think they contacted some other council members this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| about 4 o'clock when they had this realization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| So I'm going to ask that we separate the two out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6188)|
| 1:43:14| that we take the 106KB02602, which is the bigger parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| and that's the one that we want to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| And we would ask that they then zone this neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6204)|
| 1:43:32| And then the piece that's 106KB02603, the office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6212)|
| 1:43:38| that's the one that has the former Florence Crittenden home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| It's a historic site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| I think it's in pretty good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| And that has great potential as an office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| I'm going to ask the law director to state that motion the way he would like to see it stated to achieve your goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6230)|
| 1:43:57| If I'm understanding this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| I think the appropriate motion here would be to amend this resolution to delete from this motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6238)|
| 1:44:07| parcel 106KB02603 because you don't want that to go back to MPC and leave in the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6247)|
| 1:44:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| So your motion is to amend to delete that particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| And which one is that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| That's the one with the big house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| That's the one with the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| And so deleting it would mean that it would later on we'll look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| and it will be zoned office, which is the appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| And not this neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| The corner lot that is the bigger of the two pieces of property is the one that would be zoned neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6281)|
| 1:44:48| That's what MPC recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| No, MPC did not recommend neighborhood commercial for that larger piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| They recommended office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| What was their reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| Mr. Donaldson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| Mr. Donaldson, would you like to answer that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| I'd like to answer several questions here and perhaps offer a recommendation on the proper wording of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6306)|
| 1:45:14| assuming that you don't follow the Planning Commission's recommendation later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| You already have a recommendation regarding the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| and the Planning Commission did consider NC1 for that corner parcel, so there's no need to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6323)|
| 1:45:30| You already have a recommendation from the Planning Commission on the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| and the Planning Commission considered neighborhood commercial for the corner parcel on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| so you don't need another recommendation from the Planning Commission there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| What you do need is to initiate your own plan amendment request to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6345)|
| 1:45:54| presuming that that's what you end up voting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| because state law requires that the Planning Commission adopt the change to the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6358)|
| 1:46:07| They have done that, and then the vote by the council is to approve and make it operable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6367)|
| 1:46:13| In the event that you don't want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| you then have the opportunity to initiate your own plan amendment by sending a resolution back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6375)|
| 1:46:23| to consider your proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| They will do that and send it back to you, then you can act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| Now we're all in the woods, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| Should you decide to do something like this, all you have to do is initiate a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6393)|
| 1:46:41| for the corner parcel to neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| because you already have a recommendation on the zoning, a recommendation on the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| Planning Commission considered NC1 on the zoning, neighborhood commercial on the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6412)|
| 1:47:03| So you've had the recommendation for those two actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| Let me see if I can get this straight and if you and I can agree on the appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6428)|
| 1:47:16| Assuming they want the corner lot to be C1 or C something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| and assuming they're okay with office as recommended by MPC on the other lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6442)|
| 1:47:29| then we could handle that later on in this agenda simply by allowing the one to go through as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6449)|
| 1:47:39| and dividing it up and making the corner lot C1 if that's what they choose to have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| and just go ahead and pass that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| And then we could amend this resolution right here to say we're asking MPC to initiate a sector plan amendment for the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6467)|
| 1:47:59| That won't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| You as city council have the authority to initiate your own plan amendment to the general plan, which is your sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6481)|
| 1:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| Isn't that 12J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| Or L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| 12L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| 12L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| I can't figure out the difference between this and 12L, M, and N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| I mean, we're rezoning in one and then we're rezoning again by changing first the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| then the one-year plan, and then the rezoning to O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| Well, one's the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| The ordinance is to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| The other's this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| And what you need to do with the resolution is initiate your own plan amendment to neighborhood commercial for the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6518)|
| 1:48:49| The planning commission will consider that and make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| and send it back to you in accordance with state law, and then you can act in any way that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| But is that not accomplished by TCA 13-3-304B2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6538)|
| 1:49:06| I don't know what that reference is without the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| I think we need a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| You cannot act to rezone the property until it's consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6551)|
| 1:49:18| So you have to hold off the actions on the corner property until the sector plan is amended to read neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6558)|
| 1:49:27| But you can act on the second lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| Can we move 12L, M, and N up so that we do that first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| I mean, that's yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| Well, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| You can go ahead and for the one that's not the corner lot that they zoned office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| you can go ahead and get that rezoning done and out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| But I think under the law, if you want that corner lot to be C1, you're not going to be able to do that until the sector plan gets changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6594)|
| 1:50:05| And there's no vehicle in this current agenda for changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| Is that right, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| So what you need to do, if this is what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| what you need to do is just amend this corner one out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6619)|
| 1:50:26| You don't really need this at all, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| You don't need this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| What you need to do is take the non-corner lot that you're going to zone office, deal with it separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| go ahead and deal with it tonight and postpone the part that you take out, which is the corner lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| and defer that until you can get a sector plan amendment to come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Mayor, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| If I could, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| Mr. Holt is here, and obviously this was put on the agenda for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| And I'm wondering what your timetable is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| And I know that Mayor Burchett is trying to sell properties to pay bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| So where are we on that if we postpone part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| That's what I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| We would be okay for a postponement of no more than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| So you're still within the timeframe that you have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| That can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| It can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| What's the timeframe, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| State law requires a 30-day public notice for any amendment to the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| so we wouldn't be able to get it on our agenda until July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| Which is the new fiscal year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| What say you, Mr. Holt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| We're okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| You can live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| July, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Can you answer one other question while you're at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| The phone calls I got were a concern that commercial might put a lot of traffic where kids are moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| walking, that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| Have you all addressed that some way in the way you've looked at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| Let me begin by saying we haven't gotten any calls, and that includes the mayor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| And we've had no contact from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| And Doug Harris is the school board member in that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| and neither myself, the finance director, or the mayor has heard from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| In fact, this is the first time I've heard any issues about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| But there is quite a lot of traffic at Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| I think we're back to what the lawyers said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Well, addressing the traffic issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| one of the exits from the school property crosses Middlebrook Pike, and there's a crossing guard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| The other exit from the school property is on Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| The speed limit on Francis Road is 15 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| The speed limit on Middlebrook Pike is 20 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| But there is a crossing guard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| And that exit that's used by most of the kids who are within that parent walk zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| they go through I guess what would be called the back piece of the property onto Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| They cross Middlebrook Pike now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| There aren't very many kids who cross Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| And this property is on the corner of Francis and Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| We're back to what Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| We chop out the piece and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| So who has --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| Can you state that motion, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Or what action do we need to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| Let me ask Mr. Donaldson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| Mr. Donaldson, what's the appropriate vehicle for city council to initiate the change to the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6813)|
| 1:53:42| The best vehicle would be a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| This resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| Yes, that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| I'll be completely rewriting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Well, it would be extracting all of the stuff that you don't need out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| So the proper motion then is to amend this resolution to make it a resolution in support of amending the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6838)|
| 1:54:08| to make the corner lot neighborhood commercially zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6848)|
| 1:54:16| Well, in the plan we use land use classification, not zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| Give me the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| You want to initiate an amendment to the land use plan to designate this corner lot as neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6863)|
| 1:54:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| We need a motion to amend this resolution to do that for this corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6877)|
| 1:54:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Are we clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| We have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Anybody want to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| We have two attorneys up here and a planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| The resolution is just asking them to go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| The resolution is just asking them to go look at it, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| And first, this is the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| So then we pass that, then we go back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| So we're going to vote on the amendment, the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| We got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| And now we go to the original motion or original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6921)|
| 1:55:28| I think that's why we have your attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| Well, the way it's going to read is that city council respectfully or city council hereby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6934)|
| 1:55:43| initiates by this resolution an amendment to the parcel of property 106KB02602 in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6943)|
| 1:55:54| to make it whatever the proper designation is for neighborhood commercial zoning, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6954)|
| 1:56:01| the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Neighborhood commercial land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| Neighborhood commercial land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| This is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| We're going to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| I'm moving to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6974)|

| 1:56:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| And that is passed as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=6984)|

| 1:58:13| Yes, I see that Mr. Wetzel is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| The thing that was missing from this thing was it didn't say how much this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7096)|
| 1:58:24| control was going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| It just said we'll enter into an agreement with the state that will allow us to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| it at our expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| What are we getting into here is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| Is this the $1.5 million that happened several months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| This will be part of the development agreement which you'll see come forward as a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| that installation, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| But that's the $1.5 million that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| That will be a portion of that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7125)|

| 1:58:51| We're working on the agreement at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7133)|

| 2:03:53| You were the first three that signed up, so I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| Okay, Mr. Roach, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| And as you know, for council rules, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| My name is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Residence 2404 Victoria Avenue, 37915 Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7445)|
| 2:04:10| I'm a member of the Neighborhood Advisory Council representing the 6th District, second seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| And on this resolution, the shelters would be just handed over, I'm assuming, to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7456)|
| 2:04:27| And in my district, I'm also a frequent user of public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| And the routes that I primarily use are the 33, 34, 32, 31 routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| Along those routes, we do not have – we have some shelters and benches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7480)|
| 2:04:47| but those places where people board the most, there are no benches, there are no shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| I would urge that you disapprove of this, vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7494)|
| 2:05:02| Simply because unless you have a substitution resolution that comes about where the shelters are dismantled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7502)|
| 2:05:14| and then re-situated in those areas – and I can give you ten locations right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| just on the routes that I frequent, where they could be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| One, actually, is the L.T. Ross Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| There's a bench there, but no shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| And that area is used by all types of people, and it's daily used, heavily used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7530)|
| 2:05:38| The location, bus stop at, where there is no bench and no shelter, at MLK on the 33 route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7538)|
| 2:05:47| MLK and at Eternal Life Church, open, just an open area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| So – and another location would be at McConnell and Bethel, Eastport Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7552)|
| 2:06:01| Those are places where shelters could definitely be put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| If there are plans that KTA has made or they're in the making, in the works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| for shelters to be added into these areas where the need is obvious, that's fine, I understand that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7569)|
| 2:06:16| But in the process of being – having it explained to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| I was told that these shelters have been zeroed out in terms of the accounting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| that they have no use, technically, on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| But I've frequented, on the university, at least five of those shelters, and they are strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| There's nothing wrong with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| Whatever cost, in the resolution it was stated that they were purchased with grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| So, you know, take those resources that you already have and put them where they could be well used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7607)|
| 2:06:54| And, again, in my area, my district, they definitely could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| Thank you, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| Now, Mr. Hubert Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| 2323 Knoxville, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| First, I'm hopeful that for those individuals who have sat through this very important meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| that you all will give them some leniency and at least allow them to make some remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| But just in case you don't, I want to recognize Emojie Abdullah-Hodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| He has sat through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Mr. Roach, who just spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| Jim Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| Mr. Anthony Hancock, our own All-American, is here to support a no vote on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7650)|
| 2:07:38| None of these persons are here on my accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| They're here on their own because they believed in the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| I had no idea what they were going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| They're here on their own because it is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| I will say, though, I think it is the first time I have addressed this body since some of you were elected mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| and four members of council back in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| I'm hopeful that for those of you, five, who are out there campaigning, going through the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7677)|
| 2:08:02| can take this issue and say that you supported it by voting no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| and supported improving the conditions for people who ride public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| Now, I looked around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| I don't know everybody's lifestyle, but I would wager there are not ten people in this room who use public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| But there are thousands and thousands of the citizens that you represent who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| You were kind enough to appoint me to the Knoxville Transit Authority in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| So I'm here totally in support of not giving those shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| I will be voting no to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| Certainly the university can do business with whomever they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| However, we have no obligation to give them those shelters, but we do have a great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| And that's what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| This is about a great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| Now, you may hear, I don't know what anybody's going to say, but you may hear, well, we don't need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7726)|
| 2:08:53| They have no value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| Well, if they don't, why does the new company want them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| They want them so they won't have to buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| Well, that's their problem, not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| I'm going to be very blunt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| Steel doesn't lose its value in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| Most of you, if you read your e-mails, I think I sent each of you a photo bucket of about a dozen or so pictures of the campus as they existed on Sunday, May 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7749)|
| 2:09:20| They're in great repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| There's nothing wrong with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| There is no reason that I can see that we should give them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| Now, there may be some reasons that the administration may give you, such as they may rather their mechanics be doing something else other than replacing shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7768)|
| 2:09:36| However, their mechanics install them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| Our mechanics, I should say, as a member of the KTA board, our mechanics can remove them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| And certainly, if we didn't want to place them somewhere immediately, I strongly believe that the city would certainly have somewhere that they could help with a little storage for a few shelters temporarily until we get them placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7783)|
| 2:09:55| I heard what Elwood said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| He is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| That's just one example of many places around this city where we need shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| Yeah, sure, there may be some in the pipeline, but when is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| We have ten shelters now that belong to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| We should go and get them and put them in places where they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| People are standing in the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| As the weather intensifies, people will be standing in the heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| There are places now that have shelters, but they could use more because the great thing about it is our service is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7817)|
| 2:10:23| Our ridership is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| And so we need those shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| I would encourage you to vote no on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| Certainly, being here since 7, there are many other things I want to say, but my mind has changed about 20 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7831)|
| 2:10:37| So I'm hopeful you will allow these other individuals a minute or two, and I'll try not to use all of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| Mr. Jennings, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| Jim Jennings, 4004 Tassel Pike, small business owner in the city of Knoxville for 25 years and wouldn't be anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7848)|
| 2:10:58| What a great country we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| When I was in the 20s, we'd have picket signs outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| But now, as I've gotten older, I'm a child of public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7864)|
| 2:11:10| We didn't own a car, couldn't afford a car and buy public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| I don't mean taxi cab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| We had no money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| So my mother used that her whole life to go to a job and raise three children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7878)|
| 2:11:26| And I have employees that do the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| As a matter of fact, Mr. Smith convinced me if I didn't have to be in and out so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| and I was going from point A to point B staying all day, I would be there because he never misses an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7896)|
| 2:11:43| And cars break down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| I remember Mayor O'Hara spent a day and made every appointment in a campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| I don't know how she did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| A whole week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| Well, you know, when you get senior citizen, you have to give me a day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| But never missed an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| I'm not here to criticize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| I think they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| This is something that we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| And what concerned me was two things, is sometimes you just, well, it's a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7927)|
| 2:12:15| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| This mayor is famous for recycling, conserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7937)|
| 2:12:22| So I don't think she'd want to throw anything away or say this was carted off to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| And when we talk about grants, federal money, I'll pay a whole lot more in federal money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7949)|
| 2:12:36| than I do this small city property taxes and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| So these buses are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| And I drive by every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| And when you're raised on the lower end of the economic situation, it's pretty tough to get where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7967)|
| 2:12:58| You've got to do what you've got to do to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| And this young lady, when I'm going in the morning, she's coming down, and she has some physical liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7984)|
| 2:13:11| And she walks about, it's about a half a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| She's coming down the hill in front of Wallace Memorial Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| And the bus stop is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| And she hides behind that pole in the wintertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| It's 100 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| And when I'm going home and coming down, she's walking up that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8005)|
| 2:13:31| But she's going to a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| And I hear all the time, well, these people need to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| Well, to have a job, you've got to have a way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| And that's what public transportation is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| Now, I follow my mom when I see her doing that and the sacrifices she made to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8025)|
| 2:13:52| So I've sat here for two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| It's a bad night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| And these are important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| But we're talking $500,000 here and two opposing sides battling for position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8039)|
| 2:14:09| And I've come here tonight to speak for the people that probably would be intimidated to come here, a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8049)|
| 2:14:20| But do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| Take these things apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| If they charge $1,500 to install these, I need to start bidding on some of these CAT contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8064)|
| 2:14:31| because that's an unreasonable amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| And I'll close with this one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| I'm in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8079)|
| 2:14:40| I've lost some bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| I buy all this tooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| And I get undercut on the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| And I don't say and use that tooling for other customers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| And I don't say, well, here, you take this tooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| I'll buy me some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| That's just not good business sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| And sometimes these things are so routine that you look past them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| It's 9 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| These people need these shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| I defy anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| Some of the days we had this winter to stand out, even 15 minutes waiting on the bus, it's a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8110)|
| 2:15:17| So don't pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| Let's use those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| Let's put them, find the spots that need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| And they've got mechanics over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| Oh, you're kicking me out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| I know it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| But just do the right thing by people that don't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| And I appreciate the CAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| I appreciate what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| We're not doing this for UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| UT can demand that new contractor that took that $400,000 from us and tell them to put some up over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8139)|
| 2:15:47| If they don't want to do it, we'll sell them ours and we'll buy some new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| Thank you, Mr. Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Oh, before I sit down and I'm going to take 10 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8153)|
| 2:15:59| I want to remind everybody that the right that we have to come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| our men and women are all over this world defending the freedoms we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8164)|
| 2:16:10| And these wars have gone on so long that we tend to forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| We just do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| But all of us probably have got relatives that have been three or four times to Afghanistan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8178)|
| 2:16:25| So keep them in your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| And don't forget our military people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| Thank you, Mr. Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| Counselor, there is another individual that has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| So I need a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| Move to suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8200)|
| 2:16:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8201)|
| 2:16:42| And one additional five minutes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| Mr. Amoja Abdul-Ahad, thank you for also being here for two hours and 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8207)|
| 2:16:54| Thank you, all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| Yes, my name is Amoja Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| I live at 614 West Hill Avenue, Suite 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| and I wouldn't want to be any place in the world but here with these lovely faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8224)|
| 2:17:10| I mean, I could do more than what has already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| I mean, it's very important that we not just take these 10 shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| and then give them away, that we utilize them in ways that are beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8238)|
| 2:17:23| I walk about 10 miles a day, various areas throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8243)|
| 2:17:29| You may see me in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| You may see me in the North City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| But we don't need to put the shelters in the North City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| We need to be sure to put them in Fountain City and South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| and East Knoxville and West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| For sure, our city is moving toward being the recycled capital of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| Our mayor is very sincere about green and serious about sustainability and recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8266)|
| 2:17:53| and this is a good effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| This is a good way to show that we're sincere about what we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| These shelters do not need to be left at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| They need to be deassembled, put in a place where they can be put up rapidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| so people can see the benefit of how our city works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8289)|
| 2:18:14| Just as was said earlier, there will be a lot of citizens who watch this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| who would like to probably come and make the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| A very older lady would say, well, I walk to work or I walk down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| In the wintertime when it's 32 degrees, I get cold, but I still have to do what I have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| So us to put a shelter for our community, for the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| to take these shelters and put them where they need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| would be something that would be profound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| It also would show that we are really great stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| We're definitely looking at how we can utilize things that are used in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8324)|
| 2:18:50| such as these shelters, how we can be sure contractually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| that in the future people will even think about it in the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| Why do we not either purchase 10 shelters when we make a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| and subtract or either use these shelters that I'm going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8341)|
| 2:19:07| instead of taking some shelters under this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| So I state once again, as I said, let's take these shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| Let's vote unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| I think it should be an unanimous vote, not just a partial vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| I don't think it should be 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| I don't think it should be 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| I think it should be unanimous, nine city council people voting that these shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| be used for the citizens in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| Thank you, Mr. Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| Okay, council, those are all of the folks who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8379)|
| 2:19:40| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| Could we hear from Cindy McGinnis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| Yes, Ms. McGinnis, come down and address the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| I'm Cindy McGinnis, 301 Church Avenue, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| First of all, it's great to hear the outpouring of support for CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| and for public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| and I think somehow the issue has gotten a little emotional here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| and I'd like to explain some of the business decision behind the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| that we did make to the Knoxville Transportation Authority at its meeting on April 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8406)|
| 2:20:12| The KTA did hear this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| and the KTA did approve to recommend to council that these shelters be transferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| the ownership of these shelters be transferred to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| First of all, we're not really giving away the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| The UT and the city of Knoxville have been in a longstanding arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| and agreement for supporting public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| UT has been a significant stakeholder in CAT for over the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| They have been paying significantly for the support of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| One could argue that they perhaps even provided the financing for the local share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| that bought the shelters in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| Secondly, I'd like you to realize that the shelters aren't going to be unused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| They will still be on the University of Tennessee campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| and we do have other routes that serve apartment complexes that serve UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| so theoretically there still could be some CAT passengers using the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| The design of the shelter is very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| There are two different designs of the shelters in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| One is a smaller design that doesn't have any back to it, nor does it have a bench in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| In order to place a bench and a back into the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| might require some additional engineering costs on the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| which would probably be more than the shelter is worth in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| So the shelters wouldn't really be easily able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| you wouldn't be able to easily pick them up and plop them down somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| without a significant amount of work unless you just want an overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| But most of our passengers want benches and a back to the bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| so they don't fall off the back of the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| These shelters were primarily designed for people walking quickly through the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| and expecting a bus to be there pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| People on UT campus don't usually have to wait very long for a bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| because the service frequencies are so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| And a couple of the shelters are actually just very large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| and it would be problematic to place them somewhere else in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| The design of the shelter isn't consistent with our current shelter design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| The current shelter design, if you've seen the shelters at Walbrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| that's more in keeping with the shelters that we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| There's also a shelter on Hill Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| It's a much techier look than this design that was selected by UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| probably 8 to 10 years ago, and it's more in keeping with the designs that you see around campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| We do anticipate that it would probably cost about $1,500 a shelter to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| And once it's removed, it has to be transported over to the CAT property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| and sandwiched in somewhere with the hopes that it won't get damaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| before we can find a place to erect it somewhere else throughout the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| Additionally, it's very problematic to install shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| It's not as simple as pouring a concrete pad and buying a shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| and bolting it to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| There are right-of-way issues. There are easement issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| It takes months from the time you decide a shelter's going to go somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8576)|
| 2:23:00| until it actually gets somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| And I know several of you are working with me on the Virginia College shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| and that's been taking several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| It's not an easy process to get these shelters out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| so it's not like we can pick them up tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| and move them somewhere else that same day and erect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| It's not as simple a process as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| And I think those are the notes I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| If you have unanswered questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Sandy, what does a new shelter cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| Depending on the size of the shelter, a basic shelter is $4,000 to $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| Was there any consideration given to selling those to UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| UT requested that we just transfer the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| It would relieve us of maintenance and liability issues on the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| Plus, the shelters are past their useful life as far as depreciation is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8630)|
| 2:23:56| And UT is a very good partner of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| We look forward to them continuing to financially support the Vol Trellis line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| and to also allow us to assist them with some transportation needs during football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| So we're not really looking to financially gain from this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| as much as we are trying to accommodate a request from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| So we definitely could ask them to financially participate in transferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| But you didn't today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| We did not because that was not their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| Councilman Del Vecchio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8667)|
| 2:24:28| I was trying to figure out if we tried to sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| I mean, I don't know why they wouldn't want to buy them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| or their contractor not want to buy them, maybe for a very knockdown price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| But as I understand depreciation, that's how you write it off on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| in plain tax advantages, but it doesn't necessarily reflect actual life in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8680)|
| 2:24:46| And so I'm hearing people say, and I saw pictures that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| there's some healthiness to these shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| Okay, they're a different design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| They're very well maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| There's nothing wrong with the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| But as I said, we were just trying to accommodate a request from a stakeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| What about asking the contractor to buy them from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| or rent them from you or whatever he wants to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| Have you thought about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| You think that's bad form with UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| I mean, that's what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8708)|
| 2:25:09| We're kind of schmoozing UT to get some of their other business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| and we're going to throw a few shelters at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| That's what I'm picking up, and I'm overstating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| But they have value, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| I mean, they have value in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| Yes, they have value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| So can we try that, or do you think that's not proper activity on Kat's part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8725)|
| 2:25:30| We'll do whatever you instruct me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8730)|
| 2:25:31| Well, this is a system that we put about $11 million a year in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| because it doesn't pay its own way, and now we're going to give away shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| I wish we could be a little bit more frugal with even small items like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| Well, I did make the point the University of Tennessee has been a significant financial stakeholder in Kat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| and it didn't seem at the time that we needed to financially gain from this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8747)|
| 2:25:55| And I'm sure you're hoping to get that contract back when the other guy messes it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8755)|
| 2:25:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| We wish UT the best of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| Let's go to Councilman Brown first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8767)|
| 2:26:08| This is in his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| He's on the Kat board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8771)|
| 2:26:12| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| In my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| Well, I have several questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| I watched the Kat board meeting today for the hour and some time that it took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8777)|
| 2:26:24| and there were several points that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8784)|
| 2:26:27| One of the suggestions at that meeting was that this be postponed for 30 days to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8787)|
| 2:26:33| and answer some of the questions that have been asked here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| And that vote was 5-3 to not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| And then there was another vote, and it was voted to send this on to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| But in the course of the discussion, several questions were asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| and Melissa Robertson was there in your place because you were in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| One of the questions that was asked was about the liability for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| These shelters are city of Knoxville assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| And we are giving those to the University of Tennessee to be used by their new transportation provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8822)|
| 2:27:10| But when Ms. Robertson was asked the question about maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| she didn't know or it was not clear who would be responsible for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8835)|
| 2:27:22| In other words, when those shelters are turned over to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| they will never call the city and ask the city to do anything for those shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| You mean UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| UT, I mean, UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| UT will never ask the city to maintain or do anything in regard to those shelters once they're turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| That would be my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| I'm not asking about assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| Is that part of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8866)|
| 2:27:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| I think the resolution was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| It's not in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| It's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| Well, when you're transferring the ownership of the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| I would assume that you would transfer the liability and the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| But if it needs to be more clearly spelled out, I'm sure a provision can be made to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8880)|
| 2:28:05| Well, I'm not comfortable with assumptions when we're dealing with legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| I have a number of people who ride buses in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| a large part of the third district that has no bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| But as I see people standing on Middlebrook Pike, Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| sometimes on Clinton Highway or Pleasant Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| they are standing in weeds up to their knees in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8905)|
| 2:28:29| There are no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| And it would really be nice if they had a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| I also find out that it takes months or perhaps years to get a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8913)|
| 2:28:38| What kind of time frame, if we needed a shelter, let's say, at Middlebrook Park Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8918)|
| 2:28:43| and Lakebrook, which would be in mine and Councilman Grieve's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8923)|
| 2:28:48| how long would it take to get a shelter there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| It would really depend on the unique shelter situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| If there is plenty of city right-of-way and we don't have to obtain property from an owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| that helps the process go a little bit quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| If the sidewalk is in good shape along that. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| They don't have any sidewalks there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| Well, we've been meeting with city engineering on working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| on even helping develop a priority sidewalk listing with transit in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8951)|
| 2:29:18| And we're having those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| Within CAT, you don't have a time frame that say typically it takes six months from beginning to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8962)|
| 2:29:29| It takes nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| It takes five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| You don't have a time frame within the CAT structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| Each shelter site is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| It's like building a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| I mean, you can run into certain problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| Sometimes the site has to have utilities relocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| and then you rely on KUB or AT&T or whomever when they get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8984)|
| 2:29:50| It's like a street project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| And it's always amazing to me how complicated it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| But there is no average. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| There's an average time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8997)|
| 2:29:58| I'm sure we could figure out how many shelters we've put in the past five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| and what the time has been from when we started it until when it ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| But you're not going to get a number that's typical for any particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9009)|
| 2:30:10| How many shelters do we have in this city, excluding the 10 on campus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| We have 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| Counsel, I do want you. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| I see Mr. Hare from UT is here and moved into position, it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| in case anybody would like to ask him questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| We have the information we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| It says CAT has grant funds available for future shelter purchase and installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9029)|
| 2:30:36| How much do we have available for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| We have to spend at least 1% of our federal allocation that we get every year on shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9040)|
| 2:30:46| and that works out to be at least $50,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| So we do routinely have these shelter installations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| We did a rather large one last year at Walbrook by the Sims and Walmart near Walbrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9054)|
| 2:31:02| and that was a little bit more expensive than a normal shelter installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| So we do have ongoing funds that we use for shelter placements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9067)|
| 2:31:12| Well, I asked at the last board meeting as the council representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| in my own neighborhood there on Brooks Road, we had discussed installing a shelter there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9076)|
| 2:31:25| and it was said that the holdup was getting the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9085)|
| 2:31:30| or the easement from the property owner, who I happen to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| That's a good case in point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9095)|
| 2:31:36| There's a cement pad there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| The shelter site is ready to go, but the owner has requested an appraisal for the parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9099)|
| 2:31:45| that he will be turning over to the city for tax purposes, and that's where the issue is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9105)|
| 2:31:52| I understand that Mr. Miracle is out on leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| and it's sort of contingent upon his knowledge to get this appraisal conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| So these shelter sites are complex, and that's what's holding that one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9119)|
| 2:32:04| Well, I have great respect for the speakers who have spoken tonight in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| and I understand where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| But what I would like to see is some new shelters placed in the city, especially in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9131)|
| 2:32:20| We do have shelters there by Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| There's a great need for more shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| But rather than to disassemble these older shelters, we really need to put up some new shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9145)|
| 2:32:33| So as the council representative to CAT, I'm going to support this, as before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9153)|
| 2:32:42| in the hopes that we will have new shelters placed throughout the city where they need to be placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9162)|
| 2:32:49| because I think it's not going to be cost prohibitive to tear these down and move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9169)|
| 2:32:55| At least that's what's said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| Now, I guess in this packet it's saying $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| That's the estimate that you've come up with or CAT has come up with to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| But I would rather see some new shelters in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| So that's where I'm at with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| And I might also add that we do have an amenities coordinator who does give updates to the KTA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9192)|
| 2:33:18| on our amenity program, on our shelter program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| So it's not like we only pay attention to this when it draws a lot of attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9201)|
| 2:33:27| We are consistently reviewing the service area to determine where the next shelter should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9207)|
| 2:33:35| That's the only comment I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| I'd like to hear from Mr. Hare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9218)|
| 2:33:40| Mr. Hare, please state your name and address for the record, and I'd like to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9220)|
| 2:33:48| You've heard the conversation so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9228)|
| 2:33:50| Thank you, Mark Hare, 7904 Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| I also am a big proponent of public transit, both personally and professionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9235)|
| 2:34:03| I think shelters are critically important to support in the public transportation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| whether it's CAT's citywide system or the university, and I kind of look at these still connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9247)|
| 2:34:12| June 1st, CAT won't go away from campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| It will change its relationship in the services and programs on campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| but we will still have special event service, significant amounts of special event service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| There's private off-campus apartments that serve campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9265)|
| 2:34:28| They come directly onto campus and use our amenities and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9268)|
| 2:34:33| The CAT lift service for people with disabilities, these shelters are really critical to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9273)|
| 2:34:38| while they wait for the CAT vehicles that bring them from different parts of the city to and from campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9278)|
| 2:34:43| So I think that's just something to consider, that there's somewhat of a bigger picture here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| and we certainly would support this and understand some of the concerns that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9288)|
| 2:34:55| And as a KTA commissioner, I'm certainly concerned about new shelters getting out as quickly as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9295)|
| 2:35:01| and we'll do everything as a board member to help support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| And I think this has raised the issue and maybe emphasized the need to speed up that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| if it's possible to get shelters out throughout the CAT system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9309)|
| 2:35:14| If you've got specific questions, I'd be glad to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| What's your position? What's your title there at UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| Director of Parking and Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| I don't have a question of him particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| I just, you know, as what I'm hearing, I don't think you're going to have a lot of luck with this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9326)|
| 2:35:33| I want to move that we postpone this for 30 days and let, you know, you've heard the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9333)|
| 2:35:41| and I think there needs to be further conversation between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9341)|
| 2:35:45| And I think that that probably would be the best route to go, excuse the pun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9345)|
| 2:35:53| I'll second your route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| At this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| If I could make a comment on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9355)|
| 2:35:58| Well, I mean, I've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| I think I have some relevant information on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9362)|
| 2:36:09| Are you fine with him responding to that part of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| The issue of the changeover over the transit systems and in talking with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| about that issue with our administration today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| they did indicate for liability issues primarily that the shelters would need to be removed by midnight, May 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9382)|
| 2:36:33| So I think that's a time-pressing issue that is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9393)|
| 2:36:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9401)|
| 2:36:42| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| Well, so he made a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| So we need to speak to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| Well, I'm going to have to obviously adjust the, you know, the time frame for, you know, for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| And I know that's going to push it, but just so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9417)|
| 2:37:04| I mean, it's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9429)|
| 2:37:10| A question related to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| How much money is UT going to be paying to CAT in terms of the services you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9432)|
| 2:37:20| I mean, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| What's the value of those services that UT will now be giving to CAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| The special event service depends on the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| We would expect still to do athletic shuttles with the university, so that could certainly range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9450)|
| 2:37:37| But we do a significant amount of business with them and expect to still do business in terms of football shuttles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9457)|
| 2:37:44| and basketball shuttles in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| That could be $50,000 or up in the six figures depending on the level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9467)|
| 2:37:53| What has it been in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| I mean, say last year, for instance, when we had the service, then what was the extra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| I'm not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| What did that pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| What the agreement for the campus bus service or special event service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9481)|
| 2:38:05| Special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| Special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| You're saying what's the history last year for special events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| Okay, hold on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| That's your question, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9492)|
| 2:38:13| Yeah, that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9493)|
| 2:38:16| I can't quote the exact figure, but it was probably 100 and some thousand total for athletic shuttles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9496)|
| 2:38:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| Back to Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| Well, and I just want to say, I mean, I've heard all the compelling arguments and the stories about people along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9504)|
| 2:38:31| but they're serving people over there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9511)|
| 2:38:34| I mean, let's not look past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| I mean, I understand the financial part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| but I'd like to see if we can't find some common ground on this because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| they're moving people within basically within my district, you know, from the student housing in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9524)|
