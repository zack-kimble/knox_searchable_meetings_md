| 0:04:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| We're here, I think, on an allegation of underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| Do we have the officer that's here to testify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| Sir, if you give us your name and address and state what happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| My name is Matt Lawson, Lieutenant, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| It's 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| On Monday, November 28th, at approximately 1701 hours, an underage person working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| with the Knox County Sheriff's Office conducted a beer purchase at 9224| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| Middlebrook Pike Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=279)|

| 0:04:47| And this is the first offense for this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| I believe so, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Sir, you've heard the allegations that have been made by the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Do you have any statement you'd like to make with regard to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| The only thing I know is from watching CCTV, which we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| the associate's no longer with the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| That actually started some personal issues for his, and it kind of transpired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| So he's no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| So I never really got his full definition of what happened or what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| Just from watching CCTV, I did notice he did check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| It looked like, I don't know if he keyed in his own birthday incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| keyed in a birthday, and I'm not really sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| but it did look like he had checked an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| We also have checks and balances at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| We have CBLs, which is computer-based learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| for all of our associates that tells them how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| We scan every ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| We can either scan them or look at them in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| He had taken the CBL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| My store's 100% on tobacco and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| I don't know if that was just a transgression of his or a mislook or what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| I never really got that output because he's no longer with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| and he never really disposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| But you're not in a position to deny that this actually occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| No, I'm not denying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=369)|

| 0:06:30| Like I said, we're already 100% on that CBL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| but we'll make sure we go back and relearn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| Even any new associates I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| the first two CBLs we take is the tobacco and the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| To me, those are the two most important ones at our location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| But we do have a huddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| We've went over this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| but we're going to actually make them do the CBL again as well just to refresh it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| That's actually a refresher CBL we do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| As long as we're doing that, just being really careful because we really take that serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| So would you like to do the $1,000 fine or the 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| They told me to take the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Then I will make a motion for the Dollar General to pay the fine of $1,000 for the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=429)|
| 0:07:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| We have a motion by Oster, second by Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=450)|

| 0:08:08| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=488)|

| 0:08:13| I represent Mr. Patel in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=493)|

| 0:08:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Is the officer prepared to testify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Give us your name and business address and tell us what you found at this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| I'm Detective Tyler Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Business address is 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| I work for the Knox County Sheriff's Office Narcotics Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| On Monday, December 12, 2022, at approximately 1023 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| members of the Knox County Sheriff's Office Narcotics Division executed a narcotics-related search warrant at 8332 Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| which is the In-N-Out Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| When officers arrived, Ms. Cheryl Stott and Ms. Sandra Michael were located behind the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=552)|
| 0:09:22| Mr. Jay Patel was located in an office behind the counter, and Ms. Andrea Allred was located in the kitchen area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| Everyone was also advised of their Miranda rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| The search warrant was the result of two undercover buys of Honey King vape pens from Ms. Stott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| Those vape pens were tested, and both yielded a very high concentration of Delta-9-THC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=580)|
| 0:09:51| It was actually quantified by a member of the Tennessee Dangerous Drug Task Force using a light lab machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| and both vape pens contained over 60% Delta-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| During the search of the business, we located 24 of the same Honey King vape pens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| They were joined together just by rubber bands in a Mentos case behind the actual CBD and other THC-derivative products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=607)|
| 0:10:20| We located 1,563 TN-Eptine pills, which is around 1,094 grams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=620)|
| 0:10:37| TN-Eptine was recently scheduled as a Schedule II controlled substance in Tennessee, starting July 1st of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=637)|
| 0:10:47| We located $8,478 U.S. currency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| During the two undercover buys, the drug buy funds that we used were deposited into the cash register inside the store as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=655)|
| 0:11:23| Officer, just to be clear, Delta-9-THC is an illegal substance in Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| Correct. It's Schedule VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Okay. And the other, the pills, the Schedule II pills, what other kinds of drugs or pharmaceuticals are Schedule II?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| What does that compare to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Fentanyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Any opiate that is prescribed as a Schedule II?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| Methamphetamine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Cocaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| All right. Has there been any criminal disposition to this case yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Other than him being charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| Okay. Ms. Blankney, you've heard the charges. Does your client wish to testify today? What would you like to tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=722)|
| 0:12:10| My client cannot testify today because there are criminal charges pending against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| That is the procedural posture that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| I am prepared to make some comments for the consideration of the commission and would be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| But in light of the fact that there are criminal charges pending and he has constitutional rights, of course, against self-incrimination and against making statements at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=747)|
| 0:12:37| it's important to note, of course, at this procedural posture, there has been no conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| There has only been a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Also, as you heard law enforcement say, there were some field tests that were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| The custom, and I see Commissioner Lee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| She's a very experienced criminal defense lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| I'm not telling her something she doesn't already know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| The custom is that when there is a suspected unlawful activity, particularly as it relates to a substance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=775)|
| 0:13:04| the protocol is that those items must be taken to the TBI, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation lab, for processing that is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| So at this stage, beyond the accusations, which, of course, Mr. Patel is here taking very seriously and intends to appear, cooperate, and defend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=792)|
| 0:13:24| at this stage we only have those accusations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| So at this point, I'm happy to make some brief overâ€”I can make some comments as counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| but if this commission would like to hear from Mr. Patel directly, that's something that he's not able to do because of the procedural posture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| So we would ask that it be postponed until a time that that could happen for him to actually speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| and his due process rights could be protected, but also his constitutional rights as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=829)|
| 0:13:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| Miranda rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| Officer, you said something about Miranda rights, and questions sort of come up up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Did they waive their Miranda rights, or you just gave them the waiver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Yes, everyone waived their Miranda rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| I said everybody waived their rights, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| But that doesn't mean they have to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| So whatever they've said, they'll have to speak further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| And I would point out, of course, there'sâ€”I don't want to overstep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| You have very capable counsel, obviously, but there is quite a distinction when you're being investigated and you decide to cooperate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| which I would like to point out that Mr. Patel did do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| He gave an open statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| He opened up his materials to law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| He gave a statement voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| There were no immediate charges at the time that he made those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| There are charges now, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| So that is when his constitutional right to remain silent obviously kicks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| I would also like to say, for the purposes of your consideration, and I think that this is important for you to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| Mr. Patel cooperated with law enforcement and gave information about the organization, the wholesaler distributor from the state of Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=910)|
| 0:15:19| so in the Atlanta area, where he purchased the materials that are at issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| It is our understanding from law enforcement, including conversations as recent as Friday of last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| that the information he provided was helpful and communicated to authorities in Georgia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| and that the facility in Georgia, the distributor, which, of course, Mr. Patel has terminated any relationship with purchasing from this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=934)|
| 0:15:45| They are now under investigation, at least in part, as a result of the communications that Mr. Patel had with local law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| and their reach-out effort to Atlanta to determine what was going on because, again, this is a company that he purchased from as a distributor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=952)|
| 0:16:01| And so, again, without getting into the merits and the details, which obviously he has competent, capable counsel, I see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| Anne Short is in the back. That is one of his criminal defense attorneys who will be assisting him in defending on the merits of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| But I think it's important for the commissioners to know that this is a unique situation, and it is one where, in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| he purchased from an organization that had a website. He paid invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| He was purchasing supplies from an entity that appeared, by all outward manifestations, to be a legitimate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=985)|
| 0:16:35| So, again, this is something where he has terminated that. He has provided information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| I shudder to think about how many other organizations might be caught in a similar situation to what Mr. Patel is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| if they believe that they were purchasing in good faith from an organization that was providing materials that are not compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1008)|
| 0:16:58| And, again, for the purposes of your information, anything that is even remotely suspect, Mr. Patel has removed from stock, from inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1018)|
| 0:17:08| He has, at considerable expense, retained our firm as well as the Bosch Law Firm, Don Bosch and Anne Short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| We went to the site as recently, again, as Friday, to look ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| If he has questions, we are making sure, because it is his intention to be compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| He has never been in any type of criminal trouble before. This is the first time he has ever been in this type of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| So, again, it is a little bit different than the usual scenario that this commission is going to be considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| for instance, for an underage cell to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| This is a very different situation in one which, first of all, procedurally, it is a little premature to consider revoking or suspending him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| respectfully, in our view, and, secondly, he is cooperating and we believe has defenses on the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1066)|
| 0:17:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| From the Knox County Sheriff's Department, after you guys served your search warrant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| did you follow up with your counterparts in Georgia to notify them that this facility in Georgia was selling questionable narcotics in Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1090)|
| 0:18:23| Yes, I sent the Georgia Bureau of Investigation the narcotics section, a copy of the case file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| and from my understanding, they used that case file, the contents of that case file, to execute a search warrant at the wholesaler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| the actual place of business and his residence as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| Do we have the ability, I do agree with Ms. Blakely, that he is in a position not to incriminate himself at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| Do we have the ability as this board to postpone this until after the criminal charges have been resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1141)|
| 0:19:11| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| This is your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| You can take whatever steps you think are necessary to carry out your function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Is it appropriate to make that motion then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| You certainly can make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Would you defer to see if there is any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Does anyone else have any comments or questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| Who were you pointing at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| Does anyone else have any questions or comments about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| I don't have any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| I just agree that we need to wait until the criminal action is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| but the motion needs to be that once that is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| the chair is notified and it is put back on the agenda for the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| That is a motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Are you all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| We have a motion on the floor by Daly, a second by Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| What is exactly the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| I don't understand what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| The motion will be to suspend until the court case is solved and then to be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| What are we suspending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| This hearing about the loss of a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| Until the criminal case is solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Defer consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| That is the wording I am looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| So we are deferring consideration until a further point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| To notify us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| I think the sheriff's department will notify us when there is some resolution of the criminal case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| We have a proper motion and second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| I do have a couple of questions related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| Is this business currently still running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| And to the sheriff's department, this amount of money that was found, this $8,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1267)|
| 0:21:18| was it separate from the TIL money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| Or was it actually in the bulk of cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| It was all one bulk of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| It was all commingled funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| I am sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I did not mean to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| You said 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| It was actually 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Is that what you are talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| It was $8,000 cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| I am sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| I thought you meant the 837.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| I didn't mean to interrupt and then interrupt incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| So that was commingled with the cash of the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| During both buys, the money that I handed the cashier, which was recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| was directly put into the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Whether they used that as change for other customers, I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1323)|

| 0:22:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Seeing a proper motion, second on the floor to defer until the criminal charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| have been adjudicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1332)|

| 0:24:04| I'll turn this over to Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| As just a preliminary matter, I was requesting, and I had spoken with former Chancellor Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| or Mr. Moyers, I really don't know how to properly address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| But for full disclosure, Chancellor Moyers swore me in many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| But I was requesting a reset of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| I'm afraid that my clients only received this letter or the summons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| We did not receive the attached allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| So all we received was the allegations of disorderly conduct is all it said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| So as such, we would be needing more time to adequately defend those allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| But we do seek to defend those allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| I don't believe it would necessarily need to be a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| I don't know how often this board meets, if it's biweekly or monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| I kind of figured, but I wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| But we would be requesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| So is it your contention that your defendants had not received any of these complaints as they occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1521)|
| 0:25:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Well, we might have known about a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| Andrew, come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| The problem is, in looking, we knew of one or two of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| I don't know if we knew of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Literally, all they got was this was all I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| My understanding is, looking at the file, was that there was between six or seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| depending on how you count this October 1, October 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| I'm not sure if it â€“ I really didn't get a chance to analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| So I really don't have the great answer for you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| Mr. Beamer, when were you engaged to represent the Bar and Grill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| And I was actually in the Court of Appeals last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| so I hate to say that this maybe did not get â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| I couldn't actively get to this as much as I maybe would have wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| Mr. Moyers, would you please give this board clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| on what we can and cannot do in this specific circumstance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| Well, the board has a great deal of leeway here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| I can defend pretty much anything the board does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| so long as there is material evidence in the record that supports what the board does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| It's up to the board whether it feels like â€“ and I can't say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| I was not involved in the service or the preparation of the summons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| so I don't know whether or not the summons that went out had the attached police reports to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| I can't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Mr. Boock might know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Unfortunately, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| So it's up to the board to determine whether or not it wishes to go forward with this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| and take the testimony from the officers and ask the owners if they have a response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| or whether you'd allow Mr. Beamer to get up to speed on these allegations and hear it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| Again, completely within the province of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| and so long as there's notice and an opportunity to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| and the board finds that there's material evidence that suggests that there's a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| that's all that the board need do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| So it's within your purview and your discretion what you'd like to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| In your view, Mr. Moyers, is material evidence these tickets and these summons that were given and the written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1680)|
| 0:28:11| Do we have officers here to testify as to these matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| The testimony, the live testimony of witnesses is much preferable to the police reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| Police reports, as Commissioner Lee would probably tell you, are generally not admissible in a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| So we would prefer live testimony in these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| Lieutenant Lawson, last month did we not get a breakdown of what actually transpired at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1720)|
| 0:28:48| Yes, Lieutenant Walker has that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| You actually briefed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Was there a representative of the restaurant or, excuse me, the bar and grill here at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| The gentleman right here was here, yes, last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| So the gentleman heard all the allegations a month ago but then waited until Thursday of last week to hire counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1745)|
| 0:29:16| That's my understanding, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| So he knew what was going on for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| My question would be, so we do not have any notice that shows they were served properly, all the documents, other than that one page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1769)|
| 0:29:38| Well, they were served with the summons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| They're required to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| I'm hearing that at least one of the owners heard the charges that were laid against him before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| It's rough on Mr. Beamer being hired late, but we've all been in that situation a time or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| I think that the requirements of due process are met if the board wishes to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1798)|
| 0:30:08| or the board can defer it for another 30 days and hear it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| It's completely within your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| I know what it's like to be retained as a lawyer at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1816)|
| 0:30:27| My suggestion would be that we give this lawyer appropriate time, that we reset it until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1827)|
| 0:30:37| Mr. Commissioner Daly, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| I would like to remind the board that in addition to the handout that Director Book sent you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| I also sent you copies earlier of all of the summons that had been issued from this residence or from this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1851)|
| 0:31:05| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Lieutenant, how many violations have they had at that location in the past, what, you have a year or a year and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1868)|
| 0:31:26| I can tell you since January 1 of 2022, there's been 31 calls for service at the El Tequila Bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1886)|
| 0:31:34| varying from fights to thefts to medical calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| That goes through November 10 of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| I was unable to get anything more current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| We had an unusual amount of threats to schools today and our 911 system was overloaded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| so I was not able to get the calls for service from November until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| I can get that for you for the next beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| So in 10 months, they've had 31 different times that the Knox County Sheriff's Department has responded to this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| In that 10-month period, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| And he was aware of this 30 days ago when he was here before us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| So I guess I have a problem that, you know, this is obviously a business that is a consummate violator of Knox County's ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1937)|
| 0:32:32| and just because at the 11th hour they decide to hire an attorney, that we have to put our whole, everything on hold for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1952)|
| 0:32:44| You know, that just gives them another month to continue to do what they've done for the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| So I'm going to be voting against this because I think this is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| I think we have the responsibility to the community that if we have a conscientious violator of our beer laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1975)|
| 0:33:07| and it is a privilege to sell beer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| It's not a right that we should take action today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| I did have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| Lieutenant Walker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| You made the statement that was one of the questions I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| Since December the 19th, do we know of any calls out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| Like I said, since 9-1-1, we had multiple threats to schools today, bomb threats, mass shooting events that were threatened to six of our schools today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2014)|
| 0:33:48| that we have been running ragged trying to figure that out, and multiple arrests have been made of students that did these hoaxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| So our 9-1-1 system was overloaded with responding to all the parents' calls in, and they had no time to pull up the stats for me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2036)|
| 0:34:05| And I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| I would have had the stats had it not been for the threats we had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| That's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Sir, would you answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Do you know if there's been any calls out there since December the 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| I do not know of any, but I'm more than happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| I mean, what I saw was seven police complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Now I'm hearing there's 31 calls, so I'm even confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| I don't know which thing we're going from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| But 31 calls might be right there and be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| Yeah, there's 31 complaints that officers responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| There were several reports that had been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| The one that culminated most of everything was on October 1st when officers responded to a riot that was happening at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| We had to bring out the entire shift in order to quell the violence that was going on inside the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| and that's when officers observed on their body cameras kids being shuttled out of the bar at 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2109)|
| 0:35:18| some in strollers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| That was the culmination of all this, and a complaint brought forward to have their beer permit removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| I'm sorry I can't pronounce your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Castaneda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2131)|

| 0:35:39| And I'm just interested to see and get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| You know to not have anything happen after the 19th, and I'm just wondering if something happened after the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| So do you recall the officers having to come out since the 19th of December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2155)|

| 0:36:11| But, no, we have no police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2173)|

| 0:36:37| Since I took over as head of security in Septemberâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| Were you sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2203)|

| 0:36:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Since I took over as head of security in September, there have not been any fights up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| Not one fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Not one fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| And we do have a good security system that y'all are welcome to come in there and look at it if y'all want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| He got a security system outside and he got it inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| Several cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2227)|

| 0:37:12| Haven't been one fight in there since I took over as head of security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| Now, we have a lot of incidents with people arguing, and we break it up real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| But a fight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| There haven't been no fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| I put down everything I love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| There haven't been no fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Now, the officers have been coming by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| They come by, talk to us, chat with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| They might say that we're usually too loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| They might say that they just ran past to check, make sure everything's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| And then they go up the road and sit there and have a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| But as far as that, the officers is real cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| But as far as an actual fight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| No, there haven't been no fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Now, I don't know about the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Now, we did have a security guard that was in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| He had been calling the police a lot for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| He'd been calling me a lot, threatening me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| And he called this young man right here, threatening him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| But that was months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| He had stopped doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| But in September, I haven't seen no fight there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| I have not seen no fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Your statement is you went to work in September and things have been better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| I mean, yeah, it's been a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| But, I mean, you get people that, you know, argue and tussle a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| But, you know, with my method, we stop it real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| We separate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| The next thing you know, at the end of the night, they're good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| They're good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| But as far as a call, as far as fighting, I don't really know where that comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2321)|

| 0:38:51| This discussion is whether to suspend or revoke his license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| That's at our discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2338)|

| 0:39:04| Is there a motion currently on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2345)|

| 0:39:07| Then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| That's what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2349)|

| 0:39:28| I appreciate the fact that the attorney was just hired, but he really should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| hired the day after this was heard, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| And so I feel like that that is, you know, that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| It's a concern to me as a commissioner that gets a lot of these reports the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| of what's going on up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| And I don't want somebody seriously hurt, injured, or worse in this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| And I think anybody around the situation is also concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| So I'm kind of torn on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| I understand hiring an attorney, but I think the attorney needed to be hired as soon as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| you knew that you were coming here and not waiting until Thursday because every attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| that I would think would have a busy schedule and couldn't just jump right on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| So I may be leaning a little bit more towards Mr. Schoomaker at this point, but that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| my concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| And if we're getting calls, there's obviously problems going on, and we have to be respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| And for somebody to have a beer license and to sell alcohol and to have an establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| that is a major responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| And that has got to be taken serious, and it's taken serious by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| But thank you for clarifying for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Thank y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Thank y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| Has there been any other criminal charges besides the underage drinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| I'm sorry, what was the gentleman's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| To my knowledge, there's not been any underage charges at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| No underage drinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| No, they're usually open on Friday nights, really, really late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| So there's no criminal charges, though, on anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Not on the business owners, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| So the only thing we have to go on right now is noise complaints, correct, at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| I'm sorry, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| We have noise complaints and public disorder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| The riot that took place on October 1 after the gentleman took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| Define a riot for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| He said he didn't see any fights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| I mean, that one was where we had to bring the entire shift in order to break up all the fights in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| And there were multiple arrests made in the parking lot of the patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| So a large fight broke out in the parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| It was in the bar, spilled out into the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| That was at 2 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| And that's when they saw the kids being shuttled out of the bar in strollers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Just to clarify what Commissioner Ward just asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| They are not here for a beer permit violation, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| For underage consumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| They're here for disorderly conduct, inciting a riot, and public nuisance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| Nuisance business, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Nuisance business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| That's all for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| And for clarification, Mr. Law Director, that, in fact, does fall under our preview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Revocation, suspension, or imposition may be made for any violation of the provision of any article of our beer chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2560)|
| 0:42:48| or whenever, in the opinion of the board, the premises are being maintained and operated in such a manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| as to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| If everyone, the email that Commissioner Hill has sent, it's the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| It tells that on Saturday, October 1st, and Sunday, the 2nd, they were there responding to multiple incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2593)|
| 0:43:21| Five people were arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| Disorderly conduct, fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Pull that up from Commissioner Hill and read that while you've got a chance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| It tells about the baby strollers and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| I've already looked at three incidents in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| December 1st, 10th, and 1022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| There's already been since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| You know, there was supposedly no incidents after December or October or September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| I think there's already been three here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| So, look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| It's interesting what happened that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Can I ask some questions, Your Honor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| I mean, Ms. Boyd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| If my motion to be reset is not being granted, I have some questions for the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2657)|
| 0:44:25| Commissioner Moyer, should we continue with discussion on this, or do we need to get a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| before we hear from the attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Well, I don't think there is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| No, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| At this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Did you formally make that motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| No, I didn't make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| I was just commenting and seeing what we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| If the board has no objections, I do not mind if he questions the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2694)|
| 0:45:03| I think maybe the first order of business might be whether we are inclined to postpone this or not because of the legal representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2703)|
| 0:45:13| And then the result of that motion and vote would dictate whether we move forward with other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| So, do I hear a motion in regard to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| I'm on both sides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I would like for the defense counsel to be able to have more time to look at this and even, I don't know how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| if they can question the officers and they can have dialogue on their own time or if it all has to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| But also, I don't want anything else to continue regarding any public harm or nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2744)|
| 0:45:53| So, my motion would be to postpone until February, February's board meeting, with a 30-day suspension of their beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2753)|
| 0:46:04| And that in no way suspends their ability to serve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| All right, we have a motion on the floor to postpone the hearing for 30 days so they can have legal representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2773)|
| 0:46:25| but also to move forward with a 30-day suspension of the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| Do I hear a second? And Lundy seconded that. Is there discussion? Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| Do we have precedents? I'm just trying to make sure that we're not going to get sued later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| Do we have any precedents set already for what has been given down to a similar situation in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| I'm trying to think of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Normally, this body has addressed underage drinking, but I'm sure that in the past there have been incidents of nuisance-type violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2814)|
| 0:47:05| I can't think of any offhand, but it's been a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| I can say that that is a ground for suspending or revoking a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| And if this board finds, based on the testimony that's been given today, along with the testimony that was given by the officers last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2837)|
| 0:47:26| that that is enough to justify a 30-day suspension while you determine whether you wish to take any additional action in February, I think that's supportable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2846)|
| 0:47:38| I feel very similar to Commissioner Durrett on this one. I just want to make sure that we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| You might find in February that a 30-day suspension was justified and give them time served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| You have a wide range of discretion with regard to how to handle this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| I hate handing down judgment before. I'm very much a due process person, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2879)|
| 0:48:11| This one's a struggle for me, because I feel the same way you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| They still can't sell alcohol. It's just the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| I understand that. It's just we're passing down judgment before we hear the full discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| It's not like our normal, like, hey, we caught you selling to underage people. It's very black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2907)|
| 0:48:34| There's not gray. This is a court hearing, basically, is what we're going off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| We have to hear evidence from everybody, and everybody has to give testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| It's going to take a minute. It's not going to be done in 12 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| We have commission now, but I just struggle with the idea of we're going to sentence them to 30 days before we even prove them guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| If they can provide evidence next month that proves that they're innocent, we just punish them for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| I'm not saying that they are innocent, but I'm not saying they're guilty, either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| That's where I'm having the struggle of, like, all right, we're going to punish you before we even judge if you're guilty or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2945)|
| 0:49:13| Because who knows? Because I don't know. I don't think anybody knows black and white 100% for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| So that's what I'm struggling with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| Commissioner Gerard, did you have a response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| I am struggling with that, too, and what compelled me to make that particular motion is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| they can still, in fact, sell liquor. Their business is not closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| They can still operate at the same hours in which they are operating currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| It just kind of holds them to task, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| It is kind of, we're punishing them beforehand, so this is a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Was I first or you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| I'm going to support this motion, but let me say, because you guys were here 30 days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| your attorney is standing here, your security guard is standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| I'm going to make it very, very clear from District 3 that the best thing for you to do in the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| before you come in front of this board is to get all the security in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| be running it correctly, keep the fights down, and try to come back here with a clean record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| And that's the only way that I'm going to support that if I know that I can have some assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| that you guys are really going to work towards this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| Because the security of Knox County citizens are at stake here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| and that's just the only thing that really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| Thank you. Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Lieutenant Walker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Can they bring their own beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| That is up to the beer board as to whether or not they allow them to BYOB, basically, bring their own beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3063)|
| 0:51:12| Yeah, exactly. They can bring their own beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| Would you like to amend the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Did you hear my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| I did. I believe that establishments can allow if they wish. I think it's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| A lot of places do that, have corking fees and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| So, yes, if people wanted to bring their own, I suppose they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| What we regulate is the sale of alcohol by a license holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| What I'm afraid of is that in 30 days, and this does pass and postpone for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3106)|
| 0:51:56| they start bringing their own beer and then there's another fight breaks out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| and somebody gets hurt, seriously hurt, because they brought their own beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| It's hypothetical, but it could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| I'm not voting. I'm not voting. I think we need to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3127)|
| 0:52:17| Mr. Moyers, is there a difference in the beer licenses granted from this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| whether the permit says it's for on-premises or on- and off-premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| Yes, we make a distinction between on- and off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| On- and off-premise sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| So a carry-in from outside and not sold, would that be considered a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| No, that's normally in the discretion of the premises owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| They're not doing any sales if people are bringing the alcohol onto the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3170)|
| 0:53:05| The thing that troubles me is if you're not making a finding...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Mr. Moyers, do you have anything else you'd like to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| Well, I mean, to me the difficulty here is that we're making...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| we're suspending the license without making a finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| If the motion were to be stated that based on the evidence that's before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| you think a 30-day suspension is justifiable at a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| with the possibility that you might go for a greater sanction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| after they've had an opportunity to be heard further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| then that would be more supportable than suspending them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| in the absence of a finding that there have been violations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| So I think that any motion that seeks to suspend their license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| needs at a minimum to state that this board is finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| that there have been enough reports, there's enough evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| to suggest that a suspension is warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| pending further investigation and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| Commissioner Dredd, do you have any interest in amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| or restating your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| I'm just... I'm basically at the will of the body at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| I'm kind of trying to read the tea leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| I wanted to allow them time but also hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| So I'm open to suggestions or amendments to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3270)|
| 0:54:39| Would anyone like to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| I'll certainly defer to Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| I would suggest something to the effect of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| we find sufficient evidence to warrant a 30-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| and a postponement of further hearing on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| But Mr. Moyers, I'll throw it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| I think that's sufficient to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| On the basis of what we heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| I think that's sufficient to be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| So a finding by the board that there's sufficient evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| to find that a 30-day suspension is warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| pending further investigation and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| by this board at its February hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| A February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| So we have a motion and a second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| Is everyone clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| Yeah, just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| they cannot sell beer for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| and they will be back before this beer board in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| whatever that date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| And we are finding a finding of true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| to justify this 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| Before we vote, I do absolutely support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I feel like there is preponderance of the evidence right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| just in what the sheriff's office has shared with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| So no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-beer-board?start=3376)|
