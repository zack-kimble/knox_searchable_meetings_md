| 0:00:46| Commissioner Pingston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| We have 16 commissioners present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| Could we stand and have the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=57)|
| 0:01:05| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=65)|
| 0:01:14| I need a motion for the approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=74)|
| 0:01:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| I need all the individuals who plan to testify, who have the case before us, to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=93)|
| 0:01:40| Please stand, raise your right hand, and be sworn if you intend to appear before this board today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you will give here today will be the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Mr. Chairman, they have been sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Clerk, could you read number five, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Deferred consideration of suspension, revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| Raceway number 720, 8605 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| Coelho Enterprises Incorporated owner, first offense, deferred from September 28, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=125)|
| 0:02:15| Sir, please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Raceway 720, 8605 Asheville Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Wolfie, did you have some testimony to give before he speaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Excuse me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| I just want to hear from the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| As you recall, this has been continued several times pending his court adjudication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| Do you have any idea what occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Mr. Chair, this gentleman didn't stand to be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| Which gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| In the orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| Did you take the oath, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Did you raise your right hand and be sworn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Do you solemnly swear or affirm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Please raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you'll give here today before this board will be the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Okay, for a second, we're going to hear from the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Wolfie, do you have anything about the adjudication of this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| It's been continued several times, as you recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| It's been continued again up until November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| Well, members of the commission, we find ourselves in the same situation we found ourselves in the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| We are trying to determine what the adjudication is before this body makes a determination as to penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| So I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Mr. Jarrett, if he's adjudicated as guilty, what's the consequences of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| If he doesn't get a diversion, if he's actually adjudicated, then the board would have the ability to, of course, impose penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=226)|
| 0:03:56| I believe this is unique because I believe he is not only the owner, but I think he's also the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| But it would really depend upon what the adjudication is, if the court withholds adjudication, if they adjudicate him guilty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| or if they give him a diversionary program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| But what if we carried out our sentence and then he is adjudicated as guilty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| Can we go back and revoke him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| Because he's the owner that now has an alcohol violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| The safest thing would be to wait to see what the court does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| That would be your smart move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| What if it's another two or three months until the courts hear this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| I mean, we just keep bringing it back, bringing it back, bringing it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| I mean, I don't know if it's because they're seeking continuances or if that's the court's docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| Do you know, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| I'm not sure why they're doing the continuances because I've been there every time that they just keep putting it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| This happens quite frequently with this type of offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| I've got a case in a couple of weeks that took place in January, so we're running up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| Has it been set to be tried in November, Wolfie, or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| Motion to defer pending legal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Will you finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| No, I still had a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| If we like, I'm sort of like Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| If we go ahead and fine this gentleman or give him an opportunity to pay a fine or suspend him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| then he comes back and is guilty, we can still suspend his license, can't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Well, I mean, the converse is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| If he comes back and he's exonerated as well, you've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| Realistically, if you're going to impose penalty today, you should stick with the penalty you imposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| or on the alternative, you should wait until the court disposes of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| That's your safest course of action and the least likely ability for it to be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| I just don't want to see a lot of these cases keep backing up on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| I certainly understand the board's frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| I think it seems to be endemic in the system right now, and it doesn't appear to be at the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Commissioner Lukow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| I'm just going to go back to Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| I'm going to make a motion that we defer this until it's resolved in the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| because I just think that if we were to fine him now, and then if he's found guilty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=386)|
| 0:06:34| it may be that we revoke his license, and I don't want to fine him and then turn around and revoke his license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| and he's paid a fine, and if he's been found innocent, then I don't think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| that may be that we don't punish him at all if he's been found innocent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| So I just think we ought to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| And as far as this being, it is different that it is the owner of the establishment that was also the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| It's usually an employee, and that makes for, you know, an easier avenue to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=420)|
| 0:07:08| So I'm just going to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Properly moved and seconded to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Sir, what we're doing is we're going to wait for your court date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| and wait to see what the court does with your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| So the officer is going to make sure when you go to court, once the court takes care of your case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| then you'll come back before this board, and the board will make a decision as to your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Wolfie, you'll monitor this for the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| This way it doesn't have to come back every month until it's settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| Number six, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| C.J.S. T.N. L.L.C. Saddlebags, 8503 Old Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| on and off premises formerly Hot Iron and Rawhide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=482)|

| 0:08:44| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Very good, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| sale, manufacturer, transportation, intoxicating liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| or any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Has beer been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Is there an outstanding license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Is there a current beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| The clerk is informing me that it has, in fact, been surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| This application is for on and off premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Describe to the commission the nature of your business, please, so they can get a better idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| It is a been operated as set up as like a convenience store on one side with a drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| and a restaurant type on the other side with a kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| And we look to continue to operate it as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| So in the restaurant portion, obviously, you'll be selling beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| and then patrons will have the ability to take it off site through the drive-thru?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Do you gentlemen own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Anybody else have an interest in this business, an ownership interest or a professional interest besides the two of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Who's going to operate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| We'll hire a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| So generally, you two will be the overseers, and you'll hire a professional manager to run the day-to-day affairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Are you both familiar with the beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Have either of you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| Both of us have, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| We're going to now hear from the various departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| and then I'm going to defer to the county commission for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Beer board inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| I'll defer to the commission for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| I may be, I guess, dipping into your business, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| But in terms of, you know, you're going on and off premises, in general, I have issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| I guess this has probably been, I guess, the most compelling case to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| But I'd like to hear from you all as far as how you're going to stop a person from knocking down four or five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=660)|
| 0:11:09| and then taking a six-pack or a case home with him or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| I'm just trying to understand how that's going to work, or is that good business for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| I guess I'm trying to just get a feel on how the business is going to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| So if you don't mind, just spend a brief amount of time explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Of course, that isn't good business for liability reasons and many other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| So we plan on operating it more as a convenience store, selling beer over the counter, cigarettes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| and things like that during the day and cutting those sales off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| and going to more of a restaurant on-site premises drinking in the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| And so that way, you know, by cutting the sales off over the counter for people to carry out at a certain time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| we would limit or prohibit anyone from knocking down three or four and taking some on the road with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=717)|
| 0:12:10| Will you finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| I do also have the same concerns that Commissioner McKenzie has and also the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| You do understand that you're liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| The concern I have about drive-through beer sales is you don't know the condition of the driver because they're sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| and for two or three minutes, anybody can be sober enough to buy some beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| But you're potentially going to sell beer to somebody that's already been drinking at a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| And I'm going to ask the Sheriff's Department to watch you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| I don't like this idea at all, but I don't think that we have a legal basis to knock it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| But you're treading on thin ice, and I want to ask the Sheriff's Department to keep a good eye on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| because of the fact that young people like drive-through beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| and you'll be selling alcohol after you've been at a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| You'll be selling them to a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| And I know a friend's going to ask a manager to sell him a six-pack on his way out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| That's going to happen to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| And I think it's a bad idea, but I don't have a legal basis to vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| But I think you need to rethink your business plan as a liability standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| because the Sheriff's Department will be watching the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| Who's lying there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| I probably leaned on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| I share those same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| I just wonder, who's going to monitor the cutting off of the over-the-counters before we go to dining room sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=826)|
| 0:13:56| And how is that going to be monitored, number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| And, again, as Commissioner Andrews brought out, we constantly have problems with drive-through purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=842)|
| 0:14:11| As a matter of fact, in the last two years we've had two that they got caught the first month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| one the first month and one the second month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| So drive-through is a problem when you're selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| Is this the mode of operation that was handled before at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| It was set up with an on-site, off-site premises and a drive-through before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| Mr. Minan, have we had any in Sheriff's Department any problems at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=881)|
| 0:14:56| Okay, you need to speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Probably leaning on the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| We have cited it there recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| The previous owners have been cited for sale of alcohol to minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| You don't know whether that would have been through the drive-through or over-the-counter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Over-the-counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Over-the-counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| I likewise have the same concerns that McKenzie and Anders and Brown with the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| And what concerns me with drive-through is if you have someone who's just turned 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| and you sell, what age are the kids that are in the car that they may be handing this off to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| And also, are you going to make a ñ did you say you're making a time that you're cutting off from the counter from selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=945)|
| 0:15:55| Or what did you exactly mean when you said there would be a time from when you cut off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| Yes, we'll cut off off-site premise sales at a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| And we're still working on, I guess, the total business model of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| when dining room sales will start and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| So off-site also means you would not be doing the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| All of that would be cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Yes, ma'am, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| And you're going to set a time on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| But you haven't decided on that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| You're going to shut off all off-site at a certain time, drive-through and over-the-counter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| That wasn't what I understood first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| So you won't go from over-the-counter and only have drive-through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| I mean, for public safety and things like that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| I just don't think it's a good idea to be serving beer inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| and let people go out and get in their car and drive around to the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| That just doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| How many employees, excuse me, Michelle, one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| How many employees do you anticipate having here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| We'll have a general manager and maybe two or three more employees at max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1022)|
| 0:17:12| I would say at max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| I mean, probably starting off with a general manager and maybe one other employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| That's a lot of people to keep up with a floating schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| I'm sorry, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Well, you know, I'm like Commissioner Andersen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| I guess we don't have the right to turn any of this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| I just say that you really take heart to what you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| and really pay attention to the laws and who you're selling to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| and that drive-through window and over-the-counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| That's about all we can really, I guess, say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Yeah, I have the same concerns everyone else has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| You know, Clinton Highway in my district used to be notorious for beer joints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| and we still have a few out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| But back in the old days, a lot of them had on-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| and off-premises license, and it was always the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| They stop in, they have a couple of beers, then they take a six-pack to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| Your servers and waitresses, they work for tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| There's going to be all the reason in the world to do what the customers want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| And no matter how you set your policies, I would imagine that they're going to be violated from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| It's just the nature of the type of business you're contemplating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| If we had a way that we could give you an off-premises license for a certain time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| say until 5 o'clock in the evening, 6 o'clock in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| and then give you an on-premises license, say from 6 until 3 in the morning, I would be inclined to go for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1131)|
| 0:19:00| But it's just a matter of policy, and I've said it to a lot of other folks like yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| It's nothing personal against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| I don't vote for on- and off-premises unless it is a boat dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| And I look at your address, and there's not any water nearby, so I'm going to have to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| And if you were willing to amend your application, and I'm just one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| There's 19 of us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| But if you were to amend this application saying that you wanted one or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| I'd be willing to vote for one or the other, but I'm not willing to vote for both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| Are you pretty dead set on getting both, or are you willing to just request on or off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1177)|
| 0:19:46| Well, this is the business model that has been in place for 30, 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| And, I mean, this is a tough economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| So I think in order for us to stay open and to be able to operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| we're going to need to be able to operate as a convenience store and sell off-site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| but we also will need to be able to sell on-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| So I think it would be best for our business if we set strict policies to protect the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| and be able to operate both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| And you understand that you may lose a vote or two by sticking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Well, like I said, I plan on voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| I see the former name of this was Hot Iron and Raw Hide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| and now it's called Saddlebags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| That sounds to me a little more like a pub than a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| So I don't intend to vote for on and off-premises, and I'd encourage my colleagues to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| It's just not a good idea to have both of these, to have off-premise in a place where they have on-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| where people are going to be driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Like I said, it's appropriate if it's a boat dock type situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| where people are not driving, you know, away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| But I just don't think it's appropriate in these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| You know, I think every commissioner up here has the same ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| keep the drunks from drinking and driving and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| But I think both these young men understand the beer laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| and have agreed that they will abide by the beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Therefore, I'll make a motion to approve it subject to final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| I didn't say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Any noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| No, I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Nothing else on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| To adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| We'll take a recess for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| About six, eight weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| we started with a committee that was working with the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| law departments, the beer inspectors, the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| and any of us who wish to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| And I would encourage more to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| in looking at some ways that we could improve some of our beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| I've been a little bit out of pocket the last six weeks or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| and we'd like to get those started back within the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| I'd like to know what's a good day for this bunch that would like to come to this meeting to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1349)|
| 0:22:37| Any particular day of the week better than another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Mondays and Wednesdays are good for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| How can come on Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| The rest of us will be here on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| Monday good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| What I'm trying to say, Mr. Chairman, is you just need to set a date and a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| and anybody that can be here can be here, and if they can't, that's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| We can't say I can be here Monday, I can't be here Monday, we need to be here Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| You just need to set a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| I'm just trying to get a consensus if there was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Mr. Chairman, the last two or three days I got an e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| I assume all commission did from Mr. Jarrett, regarding roosters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| That's a little watering hole down in Rocky Hill that's clearly in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| and I was just wondering why you were apprising us of what was going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| unless there's multiple places called roosters and some are in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| It must have been a letter sent to the commission office, and Jody probably sent it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| Okay, that must be how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Do you recall roosters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| The e-mail I sent was that the gentleman who owns that establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| wants to likewise start a catering business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| and his concern was that, one, he was seeking some assistance from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| which we can't provide because catering licenses are a state venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| but what he was contemplating coming before this board to discuss the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| of basically having a mobile catering service in the county as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| and in so doing sell alcohol, specifically beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| Apparently he decided not to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| and I was just apprising the board that he may come before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| and if he did come, I was prepared to address the state law issues regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| We'll be back in 35 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| We'll start back at 2 o'clock sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1477)|
| 0:24:49| We're ready to start our regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1489)|
| 0:25:05| Clerk, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1505)|

| 0:26:15| We ask, God, that you be with us to conduct our county's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| Those of us that are commissioners, God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| we thank you for the honor and privilege to represent our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| as we conduct their business on their county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| Please help us, God, through the challenges we face, both individually and as a nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| And forgive us, God, and help us to correct our mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| These things we ask in the name of your son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Please stand and pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1622)|
| 0:27:17| Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| I'd like to ask that Resolution 904 be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| This is the resolution with regards to the Strang Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| We met with a group of citizens there a few days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| and we promised them that we would solicit their input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| that we would gather their information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| that they're filling out on surveys and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| And so I'm going to ask that we go ahead and withdraw that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| so that we can go through this information stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| And once we gather the information, then we can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| But we can bring this back any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Is that right, Mr. Law Director, if we withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Yes, sir, because your rules read that that would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| because you actually have not acted on the item, so that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| So I'm going to ask that we go ahead and withdraw that from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| And I've gotten some phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Some people may be here to speak, and if they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| I'd be happy to hear what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| But as far as any action from this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| I'm going to ask that this be withdrawn so we can go through the process of the surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| go through the process of gathering information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| meeting with those constituents before this body acts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| And secondly, on number 905, I'd like to ask that that be withdrawn from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| I have a couple of wording changes I would like to make on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| So you want to take it off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Could I ask a question on the survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| How wide of a distribution have we gotten on that survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Because I'd just like to get a good number, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Mr. Arms would probably be the person to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Well, I know we had like 100 the day of the public hearing, and then we had it posted online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| So we were receiving responses up until Friday, I guess, at close of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| So I can get you that number and get it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| So basically we invited the community at large to the public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| and then posted the survey online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Now, I've got a thought I want to run by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| We can put out what's called a RFI, request for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| which basically goes out to the community at large in that region and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| what space do you have available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| It doesn't tie you to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| It's simply, as several commissioners know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| you've already received phone calls from a lot of commercial wheelers saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| I've got this space, I've got this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| An RFI would simply make it a public request for anyone who has a potential building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| and it wouldn't tie us to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| It's just a gathering of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| My reaction to that, Mr. Arms, is that we made a commitment to those folks that we would get their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| and that we would sit down with them before we did anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| I'm afraid that if we go with this RFI, that the signal we're sending is that we weren't sincere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| I mean, that's just my talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| I know we are sincere, but I would rather withdraw it from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| Let's compile the things in the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Let's see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Then if we want to do that at a subsequent meeting, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| But I would just rather that we just go ahead and withdraw it at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| and let's compile and tabulate the surveys and go back to the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| and let them know what those surveys are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| And we're going to try to have all that, too, by the end of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| And Commissioner McKenzie, we're trying to matrix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| For instance, you had questions, how many miles would you drive for a center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| But then we also asked them to input their zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| So hopefully the tabulation will be in a matrix format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| where we can see different responses from different parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| So we'll hold the RFI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Mr. Arms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| You're going to have that by next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| We're going to have the summary of all the input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| Now, that's from the seniors who filled out the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| We're taking the input from the survey, and we'll provide that to you by the end of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| So you'll see what the citizens have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| And when you receive that, I just want to throw out a caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| You know, we had a great turnout on a day that was rainy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| The rest of the responses will be from seniors who are basically computer illiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| So, you know, there's still a group of citizens that we want to, just because we get the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| there's still other citizens that may want to have input later at the commission meeting and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| So, you know, it's difficult to reach a certain senior clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Yes, I just have a comment, and one of it is just a question of procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| is to withdraw it something that we vote on or is withdrawing it just something that the sponsors can vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1910)|
| 0:31:59| Or the sponsors do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| The reason, let me just tell you why I said that, what's my motivation behind this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| is that, you know, some people say there's lies and there's statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| And I don't know what the statistics are going to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| but the overwhelming response that I've had in e-mails and telephone calls and even letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| is that the seniors out there don't want that closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| They have concerns about the scheduling and the crowding at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| and they have concerns about the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| One of the things that I've learned from this entire process is that seniors do not want to drive very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| And even if we develop some sort of compromise between where the present strength center is and Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| let's say up on the Cedar Bluff area, I got a lot of e-mails and a lot of phone calls saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| that we really don't want to drive that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| And I tell you, I don't know what the statistics are going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| but I really have the impression that the truth is that the seniors that use the strength center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1971)|
| 0:32:59| really don't want it to be moved any further away from where it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| And, you know, if I had my preference today, I would really like to go ahead and take a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| I think some of the other commissioners have heard from some of these seniors also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| but to me the people that use the center, I don't know what the numbers are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| but it's probably 90% plus would really just like to leave it where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| Mr. Chairman, can I speak on this real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| I'm going to have to agree with my two colleagues out in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| I appreciate the leadership that both of them have taken on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| It's an important matter, and although the strength center does have some problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| I have to agree with what Dr. Briggs said as far as the responses I've been getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| the phone calls and the e-mails is that they would prefer that it just stay there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| but if it was to be moved, and I'd ask where would you suggest moving it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| it was always further down Kingston Pike, heading west, not heading the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| And right now I don't know that there's space out there that we can afford as a county to move it in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2045)|
| 0:34:13| so I think we need to take a look at how can we improve the current location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| whether it's paving over that lot that we've got just down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| and trying to add some additional parking and try to improve the scheduling out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| do what we can where we're presently at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| and then let's see if that works, but if we need to, we can keep our eye open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| and if another good site becomes available, then we can discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| but right now we really don't have a plan as to where to try to move this to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| and I agree with Commissioner Hammond about sending the wrong message out there if we were to try to act on it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| We need to involve the folks that are using the Strange Center to make sure that if we do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2098)|
| 0:35:07| we have their blessing as well as what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| Does anyone have a problem withdrawing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| As long as it can be brought back up and discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| No, Mr. Chairman, I don't have a problem with withdrawing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| I was just going to respond to Dr. Briggs that we've asked people for a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| We don't know what the survey says, and if we vote on it today, those people who have filled out surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| I mean, their survey is just basically for naught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| So I would like to just withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Let's look and see what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| We're not going to do anything until we involve those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| We promised them that they would be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| and so we're not going to take any action until we sit down with them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| So I appreciate Commissioner Anders going along with withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| Not so much going along with it, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Not so much going along with it because it's not a matter of if we vote today, it's going to close tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| This is a year or two process that we just keep holding up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| If it's not feasible, it's not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| But right now we're just slowing the process down, just like good government, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| just slow the process down and kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| The issue is not whether or not today's action would close the strength center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| It would not even come close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| What it would do is give us the ability to seek information to make a good decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| and now we're just taking some of the information, either delaying it or killing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and so we can't make a good decision with all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| If we want to draw it, I'll bring it back up next month with better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| Commissioner Abenharmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| All I want to do at the proper time, I'd like to let everybody know what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| I see an election going on, and we've got two election officials here that need to get back on the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| so I'd like to move 909 up as quick as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2215)|
| 0:37:04| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Yes, I just needed to take Resolution 103 off of consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and ask that we hear it around 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| The principal will be here then from Shannondale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| Will you let us know when she gets here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2241)|
| 0:37:30| Mr. Chairman, there's some citizens who want to mention Strange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| so if you let them talk now, they can go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Even though Strange is the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| I'll get to them in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Yes, I'd like to take Resolution 102 off of consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| and move it up in the agenda as close as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| We have some deputies here that have an interest in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| and I'd like to get that over with so we can get them back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| John Coleman, 11321 Gates Mill Drive in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| I attend the Strange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| You're speaking a lot about this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Of the 3,500 or so who were there, how many survey forms did you receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| Because it was only out for about three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| I don't know because they didn't come to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| They came to the Mayor's office, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| Well, as of last Friday, they hadn't even been picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| So I don't know how you can tally a survey that has not even been looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| by those who were involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| I believe that survey, if it's going to be valid at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| should be presented to the people who were involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| Mr. Chairman, we'd like to remove Item 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| It was a grant for archaeological research at Seven Islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| And upon discussions with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| we've realized we may have some conflicts with our existing project out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| So we'd like to just remove that from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| What number was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| I'll make a motion we withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| I'll just go ahead and, as usual, withdraw all those that have been withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| add all those that say to be added, and defer all those that say to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| My name is Jean Coleman, and I live in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| and I attend the Strang Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| And I really believe that, as Strang is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| it probably is one of the finest senior centers that I've ever experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| There's a nice, friendly atmosphere there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| Everyone really knows one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| We make friends with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| And granted, it's a little crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| We have some parking problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| But everyone is happy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| I live in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| It takes me about eight minutes to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| I attend two classes there every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| And I don't want to drive any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| I don't want to have to go on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| This is just ñ there's a nice, cozy atmosphere there at Strang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| And you've got 3,500 people who go to Strang every month, 3,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2428)|
| 0:40:36| And those people are friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| They love one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| We go out to lunch together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| There's so much going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| You're not going to find that if you take and make some kind of super center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| where you have offices combined with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| and you have ñ it's just going to be an entirely different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| It's going to take on an institutional atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| The staff at Strang is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| You could never find more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| You walk into Strang and everybody knows you by name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| This is what seniors are looking for because we need this friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| We need a place where we can feel loved and accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| and can really work together on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| And the computer rooms are full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| You see people playing cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| There are people who are learning Spanish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| and you should see these seniors in their fitness places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| I mean, these are live wire seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| It's not like it used to be 20 or 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Seniors who retire, we still need a life, and Strang is providing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| And you're not going to find that if you get into a great big institutional place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| where there's offices here and a health department here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| and instead of having classes where there's 30 or 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| that you're going to have 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| We have six computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| We have six computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Everybody's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Everybody waits their turn if you're not in that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Things are good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| And my feeling is when things are really good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| and as a county, you've done a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I mean, really, I admire the fact that you have put together a great senior center like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| I really thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| And when you've got a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| the craziest thing to do is pull it off the market and say, let's redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| You've got 3,500 happy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Now, regarding the survey, I didn't know I could go online to do the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| and I'm a computer person, and nobody ever told me I could go online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| that there was a survey online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| At Big Strang Senior Center, there was a little stack of papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| I said, what's this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| They said, oh, that's a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| I said, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| What's it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| My husband didn't even know a survey existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| My friend Nancy, who became my friend last week because she came to a class I'm in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| she didn't know there was a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Who knows there was a survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| When was it announced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| How was I supposed to know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| I didn't even know that there was going to be a town hall meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| because it wasn't mailed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| To me, this is important enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| This is something that should have been mailed to everyone on every mailing list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| that there was going to be a town hall meeting so our voices could be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| Seniors have voices, and we need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| And I'm really somewhat concerned that nobody seems to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| The people who go to the center, we don't know what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| A lot of them don't use computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| There should be email lists or something that's formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Who knows what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Maybe you'll read something in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Someone said that's where they first read about the town hall meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| Let's say you've got a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| I love Strang Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| There are 3,500 people who love Strang Senior Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| and they say, please, please let us have our senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| Give us some parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| We'll walk up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Give us some parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| We'll arrange the schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| But don't take away this good thing that you have done as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| So I thank you for Strang,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| and I truly thank you that you all will consider that you don't railroad this through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| that you do this slow, that you notify all the seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| Let us know what's going on so that we have a chance to speak our voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| and to help in any decisions that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Right now, we're happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| We're happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| We don't want a super center, and we love it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| where it's within five, ten minutes' drive of where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Ma'am, I have a question to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| I've had several calls, and never one of them has been against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| But I've had a couple of people to tell me that the county owned a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| not just it wasn't adjacent to this, but just up the ways a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| that we owned it, and all that needed to be done was pay for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Do you know anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Right now, the parking lot, it used to be a swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| You've still got a concrete barrier where the diving board was across the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| Then you've got this muddy, grassy field with a loose gravel driveway that leads into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| and that's where we park if there's overflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| I don't think there would be no way that a handicapped person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| could possibly park in that parking lot and get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| There aren't any lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| This is just a grassy field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| However, I think if it were paved over, if a sidewalk was made to get up to the Strang Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| I think that would be a wonderful way to solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| Also, in the front of Strang Senior Center, there is no handicapped parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| because there is no ramp going up from the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| And in the back, there are five handicapped spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| If you don't get one of the five handicapped spaces and you're in a wheelchair or crutches or a cane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| or dragging an oxygen tank, which some seniors do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| if there are no places back there, then they just have to go on home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| because they can't park in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| I think some modifications could be made to that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| which would get people in the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| I think this could be done very easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| and I think actually you need to have a senior citizen advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| who would sit down and work with you, give our ideas to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| because we like where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| and I really think that that can last for another couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| while something else is made in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| I'm going to let you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| I'd just like a yes or no to this answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| Do you think if the county went down there and paved this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| it would solve the parking problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| I think it would help the parking problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Maybe not for handicapped people, but yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| I also think if you're going to pave it, put a sidewalk up one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| because there's no sidewalk from that parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| But yes, I think that would be very, very helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| and I think that that could help a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Commissioner Koeniger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| Yes, I just wanted to say that Dr. Julie Foster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| the Shenandoah principal is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| so we don't have to put that one off until 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| We can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| It's probably going to be 3 anyway now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| I'd like to defer Resolution 801 and 802 related to the fire district, Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| and ask that Ordinance 102, reading of the dissolving of the fire district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| be brought as far forward in the agenda as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2854)|
| 0:47:44| 801 and 802 have been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| Not deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Just one further comment on the strength center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Several of us were at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| and it was made very plain that day that it was strictly for information gathering only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| The information gathering started that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| They were told those surveys would be available and that they would be available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| Anybody who was coming into the center should have been able to have gotten that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| It is not anything cut and dried yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| It's strictly information gathering to see what possibly can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| So enough of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| I have one question, and probably somebody from the schools need to answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| On 201 on the educational consent calendar, we're paying $120,000 for land adjacent to Rita School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2923)|
| 0:48:51| I'd like to know how much land that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| Four acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| What's on it, gold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| Go ahead, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2945)|

| 0:49:22| Prior to that, we went to different functions and different events at strength senior center and felt very welcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2962)|
| 0:49:32| enjoyed the companionship that we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2972)|

| 0:49:52| The leadership in strength center is superior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| I think that we need to keep what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| We're not trying to be greedy and get something bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| We just want to keep what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3004)|

| 0:57:40| I missed the opportunity to talk at a workshop on guns in parks and I'm going to try and keep my comments brief this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3460)|
| 0:57:50| One thing I'd like to point out, having sat through your last meeting, and I'm the last person who would consider myself an authority on Robert's Rules of Order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3470)|
| 0:57:59| but I do know a little bit and enough that I went back and read Robert's Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| And I'm talking in particular about Commissioner Hammond's motion, so-called substitute motion that he made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| As I read Robert's Rules, he was out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| There's a particular reason for a substitute motion and there's also a reason why you cannot use a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3498)|
| 0:58:26| And in my humble opinion, his motion did not qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| Basically, I've got a question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| I've got a copy of the current Tennessee Code, Section 3917.13.11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| which has to do with carrying weapons on public parks, playgrounds, civic centers, and other public recreational buildings and grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3522)|
| 0:58:51| And if I look down at the recent amendment that authorizes people with handgun permits to carry guns in parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3531)|
| 0:59:02| it says nothing about playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| And I'm just curious why it's specific in the title and it's not mentioned in the exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3545)|
| 0:59:14| And, of course, my question is, what do we consider a playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| And in my simple way of thinking, it's any area developed by the county, maintained by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| whether for formal recreational activities like soccer or baseball or whether for informal neighborhood activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3566)|
| 0:59:34| where children can get together and toss a Frisbee or play tag football or whatever they choose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| So, you know, my question, I guess, is are guns permitted, will guns be permitted in such areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| I mean, there's a definite distinction between state parks, between, yeah, mine's gone black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| House Mountain, and like I.G. King Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| I mean, there are different types of recreational facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| And I think we need to clarify the definition there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| And lastly, I would like to ask, you know, we had some folks talk about guns in parks at your last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3610)|
| 1:00:19| Somebody mentioned talking with their constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| Just how many phone calls have any of you had from parents who are concerned about the safety of their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3623)|
| 1:00:32| in any of the city or county parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| And how many parents have asked for permission to carry guns in those recreational facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3635)|
| 1:00:43| You know, I sat through the city county workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| I sat through the city county meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| And basically the conclusion there, when you talk about guns in parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| you're talking about a problem looking for a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| And I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| I just wanted to say I appreciate very much, you know, any citizen that comes down here to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| and thank you for coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| I think a little bit of the confusion about what we did with the guns in parks, we did not vote for guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| What we really said is that we would let state and national law stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| So any questions about the definition really pertain to state law, not to local ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| because we really didn't act on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| It was just opposite of the city because the city had an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| And what we basically said is that we didn't enact anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| We just let state law stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| So any of those questions really, I think, pertain to state law and not to what we did here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| And just to answer your questions about the number of phone calls for and against that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| I would guess it was probably ten to one in favor of the guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| Not that that mattered because we didn't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| We just said we'll let state law stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| My point is you could have enacted legislation, and my point is not how many calls did you get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| but how many calls did you get from parents who are concerned about safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| I'd say it was about ten to one, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| But we didn't act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| My experience, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| And it was probably many, many women that were for it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| But the point being is we just let state law stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| We didn't take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| And so what any of those issues are really would have to be addressed by the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Probably, I mean, like you say, the statistics can always be the death of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3756)|
| 1:02:43| But I disagree a little bit with the ten to one in terms of what I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| But I guess my question is to his other point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| I do agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| While not a scholar in Robert's Rules of Order, I do think we've been inappropriately using the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| In fact, I think sometimes we just wait for one to get our substitute motion in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| I think that there are grounds for a substitute to introduce a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| and then there are grounds where you cannot introduce one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| So what I'd do is ask the law director to research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| And maybe at the next meeting, if you could give us some guidance in that regard so that we can more appropriately use a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3800)|
| 1:03:29| Because I do agree with you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| It has been inappropriately used in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| Alan Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Mr. Chairman, because it has been brought up, I'd like for the law director to give his opinion on whether or not I made a proper motion at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3820)|
| 1:03:50| I'm of the opinion that the motion was proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| You recall that you do have, in fact, commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| And I believe those rules are complied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Your rules do state in Section T that all matters not covered within these rules are governed by Robert's Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| So I believe the motion was appropriate and within the confines of your rules and within state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Yeah, I was just going to say that I do watch C-SPAN probably a bit more than most folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| And I watch the state legislature and I see the substitute motion used by other legislative bodies very much the way it is used here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3860)|
| 1:04:30| So I didn't see anything improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| I'm sorry to come back to this because I don't know whether that was your answer to my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| Because as Commissioner Lambert said, he's seen how it's used at state and federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| I think your answer said that where we don't specifically state how we conduct our business, Robert's Rules of Order apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3884)|
| 1:04:55| So I guess what I'm asking is, is my request still out there to conduct the research and come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3895)|
| 1:05:04| Or was that your final answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| Well, my final answer would be the will of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| I mean, we'll undertake anything you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| You have a rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| You can certainly have the rules committee look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| But again, you do have rules in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| And if the commission is uneasy about its procedures, it can certainly modify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| So I guess what you're saying is the substitute motion is specifically called out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| and the proper use is called out in our commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| That's where I am to go to look for it and not to Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| Yes, and if they're not there to your satisfaction, then your rules committee can certainly insert them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| Commissioner Lothar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| Whether or not there's been an occasion that maybe a substitute motion was out of order or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| I think instead of trying to research it, I think the law director is here to advise us as we move along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3956)|
| 1:06:05| and go through our orders of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| If a motion is improper, whether it's an original motion or a secondary motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| or anything else that's brought up, it is his job to let us know that it was improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| And I think he's done a good job and we just need to leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3980)|
| 1:06:28| I don't know that there's anything to research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| If you feel that or any commissioner feels that a motion has been made, whether it's an original or a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| it's been made improperly, you can call a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| And at that point, we'll get a decision from the chair, from the law director, as to whether or not it's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4002)|
| 1:06:49| Let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| I'm not making any disparaging remarks to Commissioner Hammond, Assistant Law Director, or anyone like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| I just want a clear answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Okay, so this isn't personal at all other than the fact that I think that we've improperly used that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| So please, I want everyone to clearly understand this was not a slap in any direction at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4024)|

| 1:07:14| Do we have Alan Lawson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4034)|
| 1:07:22| I'm Alan Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| I'm Director of the Knoxville-Nos County Emergency Management Agency at 605 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| And I wanted to make you aware of a program we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| It's called Get Ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| In emergency management, we do a lot of work with emergency services as far as being prepared for disasters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| We do training and exercises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| We just did an exercise at the airport last Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| The other side of that is helping citizens be more aware of things they can do to protect themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| So we've come up with these Get Ready bags as a grant program we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| And it's a bag that you would put your emergency kit materials into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| It's got a list printed on it of all the things that you have to make yourself better prepared in a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4082)|
| 1:08:10| And I wanted to give each one of you a bag and encourage you and everyone to get ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4090)|
| 1:08:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4098)|

| 1:14:10| And you'll see it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| It's three pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| Now, I remember seeing the originals, and they were like 20-something pages long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| and there was like 15 or 20 pages of failed laboratory tests attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| But all the failed laboratory tests were missing, and it was only three pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| And he swore up and down that's all there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Now, in 2003, the Solid Waste Department, as it were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| swore up and down that no 2003 annual biosolids report ever existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| And you see that it's not on my receipt that was provided to me on April the 7th of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| Now, the problem is that two weeks before that they made this ledger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| And on here the 2005 annual biosolids report is 21 pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| And the 2003 biosolids report did exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| So somehow in two weeks' time we had several pages of failed laboratory tests disappear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4504)|
| 1:15:12| and an entire year of annual biosolids reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Now, when I got the 2005 annual biosolids report from Mr. Salter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| the certification statement was not only missing all the laboratory tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| but it says I certify under penalty of law that the pathogen reduction requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| and vector attraction requirements have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| This is for 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| The original report said they have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4538)|
| 1:15:47| Now, I've been asking for these original reports for a year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| and they've swore up and down that 03 didn't exist, but I've got a ledger that says it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| He swore up and down that 05 didn't exist, but I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| And he swore up and down that it was only three pages long, but the ledger says it was 18 pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| Now, I've recovered those other 18 pages, and I thought you'd like to see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4565)|
| 1:16:14| Most of them are basically the chain of custody and failed quarterly laboratory tests on your compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| Most of them are alarmingly high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Here's your fourth quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| Your limit for salmonella is three colonies per every four gram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| This was 1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| Your limit for fecal coliform is no greater than 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| This is greater than 1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Here's your third quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| Again, it was greater than 1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| That's sky high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| They just quit testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| They just said it's so high, we just quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| It's over 1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| Why continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Also, you had heavy metal problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| Your molybdenum limit's like 16 milligrams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| This was 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| And basically, John had certified the material had failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| Here's second quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| Your salmonella limit is three colonies per four gram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| This is 470.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| Your molybdenum limit is 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| This was 272.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| So basically, all of your failed laboratory tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| and this is not an isolated incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| This happened for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| Your solid waste department went through your EPA biosolids records for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| removed every single failing laboratory test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| and changed the certification statements to say everything passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| and I can prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| Now, I've been asking for the originals for over a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| and they've swore up and down to you that they don't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| but I just showed you one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| They swore up and down to me that these reports were only three pages long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| but I just showed you a ledger from their own department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| It showed them 21 pages long, and I've got the missing pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| So I know this commission seemed surprised last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| when I told you all that they lied to you about the 2008 lab test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| Rodney Rocket went out there repeatedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| and tested the material being sold to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| and it all the time failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| and he told his superiors it failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| and he told Mr. Salter it failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| and he told Mr. Weitrick it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| But yet, Mr. Weitrick signed and gave you an agreement that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| Knox County diligently investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| and reviewed the recent third-party allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| that the products produced were somehow unsafe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| or present a health risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| and believes these allegations to be unfounded and without merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| Well, basically, I want you all to know what your investigation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| Your investigation was they went through years and years of laboratory tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| and took out all the failing tests and changed the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| And I can prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| If this commission can help me with anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| force them to turn over the original EPA reports or resign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| I received some information that around the time I was asking for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| that your solid waste department went and shredded all the old documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| I can prove what they said, and I've got one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| The major question now is why can't they produce them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| They're not going to get my copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Let's see if they can produce them, because I have good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| They shredded all the failing reports, and now they can't produce them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| So let's see if they can produce these EPA biosolids reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| signed by John Evans that, like I just showed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| certified the pathogen requirements weren't met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| Mr. Salter admitted in his depositions that he redid these reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| You don't redo something that don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| I need this commission to help me retrieve the originals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| if they, in fact, have not been shredded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| That's what I need help on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| And, by the way, there's a lot more money on this facility that I haven't discussed with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| There's a lot more money missing up here I'm working on, lots of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| But that's what I need help from this commission on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| and I hope that one of these commissioners here will put the heat on the right people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| and make them cough up all their original documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| This happened on your green waste reports, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| I have the original green waste reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| They showed this company got more green waste than what was promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| They all went missing, and a new fraudulent set of numbers were prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| that underreported the green waste and was entered into evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| Brad, you need to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| I have those originals, too, but I need help on getting these original biosolids reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| You know, commissioners, this is really disturbing me because Brad keeps coming to us every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4836)|
| 1:20:44| for probably two years now, and we've not found him wrong in anything that he's ever given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4844)|
| 1:20:51| And it sort of aggravates me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| He's asking for stuff that should be easy to get, and why are we trying to hide stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| Why are we trying to cover up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| If something's wrong, let's get it and get out and let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Brad, who do you need this information from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| It should be on file with the Solid Waste Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| If they don't have their copies, Natural Resources should have a copy of their annual reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| I have a letter from the EPA from July of 2007 that said when they showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| they had all their annual records, so they should have copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| We've got people from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| Guys, can we get Mr. Arms, can you get us what we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| I don't know if we can or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| We're in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| I don't know if this is the forum to track down documents for any litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| And that's a concern, too, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| You are in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| I don't want to mess up anything that you're doing with litigation, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| This thing is really out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| There's a lot more out there and it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| I was called last week and was told that the place is going to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| Brad, had you heard that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| I heard a similar rumor, but at this point it was just a rumor to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| So I don't put a lot of faith in the things and I don't repeat things from this podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| unless I have the documents to back up my statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| Well, I have a gentleman that called me and said he would like to bid on the property if it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| what was going to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| But, you know, to me, while this stuff is going on, I don't think we need to turn loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| We need to get to the bottom of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| It's been going on two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| And I think, you know, the administration needs to get you what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| This is the amazing part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| One of the times I was at Solid Waste, I physically followed Ms. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| Mr. Salter would send Ms. Roach back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| And I physically followed her back and I kept sending her back and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| no, I know a 2003 report exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| I've got a ledger that says it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| I've had a copy of it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| I've got the documents John done to prepare it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| Where's the 2003 report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| And I knew Tom Salter had done one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| I said, well, where's your 2003 report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| They swore up and down a 2003 report didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| Ms. Roach swore up and down that Tom or John, neither one had ever done a 2003 report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| And I actually followed her back when she went into Tom Salter's office and stood in the hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| and she said, Mr. Mays is wanting your 2003 report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| And heard him tell her to tell me he had never done a 2003 report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| Well, the problem is, not only had he done it, he'd already filed it with TDEC at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| and I already had a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| I was just doing that just to see how far back this would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| and I was just astounded at the deception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| You know, Brad, here's something else that really disturbs me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| These are tough times, economic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| And it's going to probably even be worse in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| You know, yeah, we did some stuff out there at Hal's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| Some money, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| But that is nothing compared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| The big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| The big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Commissioners, we're talking hundreds and thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| And we need to get to the bottom of it because it's taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| Put back in our coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Let's get to the bottom of this thing and let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| It is dragging and dragging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| And it bothers me that it's drug on for all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Are we protecting somebody or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| Well, and the other problem that I've brought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| I have witnessed Mr. Salter's truck across from my business on multiple occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| Mr. VanGilder one time was followed by a white Chevrolet pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| He's not sure who it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| When he returned the receipt books when we were doing the Hal's Greenway sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| Mr. Rockets went on the record saying he's rode with Tom while he's done these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| Where is the corrective action by engineering on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| I mean, where's the corrective action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| My wife's been scared to death over some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| I mean, how would you all feel if a county-owned vehicle followed your wife to the grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| drove by your house, or sat across the street from your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| when I have to leave and run a delivery and my wife's left there by herself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| and he's sitting over there across the street from my business in a county-owned truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| How would you all feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| And then find out that he had a co-worker come in and want to borrow a shotgun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Where's the corrective action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Where's the corrective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| We just saw an engineering and public works employee on the front page of the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| driving a vehicle drunk with a .38 with the serial numbers filed off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| with crack, cocaine, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| Well, wonder how it gets that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| I mean, I made Mr. Weitrick aware of what Mr. Salter was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| Where's the corrective action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| They've reviewed years of failed lab tests and then testified everything passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| You have public relations people sending you letters, everything passed, everything passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| Well, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| The majority of their stuff failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| But they withheld it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| And seeing that, that's what bothers me, Brad, is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| Commissioner Smith, you need to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| You know, if things are being covered, as you say, and I'm not going to get in the middle of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| but if things are being covered up and forged, whatever, let's get to the bottom of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| and let's move forward because, you know, I'll just save comments for later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5174)|
| 1:26:22| Commissioner Markholman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| I would just add that Commissioner Smith is on to a very important point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| And I don't think that the lawsuit argument makes sense because if it's a relevant document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| it has to be provided under discovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| And if it's not a relevant document, then it should be available as a normal publicly available open record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5197)|
| 1:26:44| Either way, there should be access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| I'm going to summarize pretty much what Commissioner Harmon just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| If this does fall under, as Mr. Arms indicated, the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| your attorney could ask the court to issue a subpoena as part of the discovery process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| and they would have to provide it or they're in contempt of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| If it does not fall under the parts of the trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| your attorney could file a request under the Open Meeting Act and it would have to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5231)|
| 1:27:19| They have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| I mean, it's contempt of court otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Well, originally his story was he had to redo the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| He changed his testimony to say they never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| And he won't turn them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| I've sent a half dozen open records requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| Well, what I mean is if it's a subpoena under the discovery process by a court order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| it's contempt of court if you don't turn over documents as part of the discovery process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| Maybe we should fire him for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Well, I mean, you go to jail, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| It's not something we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| It's something the judge does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| I do have someone looking into this, and that's Ms. Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| I understand she has had a death in the family, and so I'm sure that has put her behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| But, Brad, I would like for you to write a letter to our chairman, C.C., to Ms. Reeves on the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5286)|
| 1:28:14| You've already talked to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| I've spoke with Ms. Reeves, and there is a reason that this report has not been issued yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| And I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| It's a very legitimate reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| Ms. Reeves is working on this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| There is a purpose that it has not been released yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| But she's working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| I don't want me appearing here to in any way insinuate that Mrs. Reeves has not been doing her job, because she has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| She's done a very diligent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| I just think that it would be great when I'm trying to collect a million dollars for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| if I could be given the real documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| It's kind of hard to litigate something when all the records keep changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| The green waste records change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| The laboratory tests change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| Everything changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| And it's really good to have the original set of documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Well, this is something I would like for her to look into as she's looking into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| And, again, I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| She's doing her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| I have a lot of confidence in Ms. Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| I've known her a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| I don't question her integrity at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| And so I think when we get her report, it's going to be a thorough report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| It will be well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| And I'm obviously looking forward to it, as I'm sure you and everyone else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| I guess I would ask our law director, after Ms. Reeves is back following the death of the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| if you might just touch base with her and see if we can maybe get an idea of when she might be wrapping this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| because I think we're all anxious to see the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| But we don't want to hurry it, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| but we also want to make sure that if she is going to give it to us in a timely fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| that we know what that timely fashion would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| We'll certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Commissioner Smith, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| Yes, but I'm just going to let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| I'm just concerned about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| You know, there's millions of dollars out there that we need to get back and put back in our coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| You know, guys, let's do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| Thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| We're going to resolution 101, page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| Resolution honoring Knotts County Commissioner Richard Briggs for his dedicated public service to the citizens of Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| Finance, 7-0 to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| Governmental, 5-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| I make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| This was at Commissioner Briggs' request at finance meeting it be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| You know, we, you know, I think it's totally appropriate for us to honor each other when we do good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5435)|
| 1:30:45| I think Commissioner Briggs is an outstanding citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| He has been an honorable member of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| And this resolution is honoring him for his work on both of my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5454)|
| 1:31:02| You know, a lot of people can say they've had a loved one that was saved by Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5462)|
| 1:31:09| I can now say that both of my parents were saved by Commissioner Briggs, and I want to honor him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5469)|
| 1:31:16| So I'm going to make a substitute motion, and I do think it's proper that we go ahead and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=5482)|

| 1:43:13| Page 16, Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| This is creating a multi-agency committee for the purpose of creating policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| relative to the use of city-county parking facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| including but not limited to the city-county building and the White Castle parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6206)|

| 1:43:40| 5-0 to approve. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to change a couple of wording in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| And, again, thank you, Commissioners, for approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| Where it says the designees to this body, I would like to see either them or their designated representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6231)|
| 1:43:59| That way, if one of them can't attend a meeting, they can have a designated representative who would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| Secondly, the way it reads, they would come back to either both the City Council and the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| for approval of any of the policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| I'm going to recommend that they just issue us a report trying to get the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| and the County Commission to agree on anything maybe a bit problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| But if this committee has met and if everybody there has agreed this needs to be the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| I don't have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| But I think that they should issue us a report and say this is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| And if we have any questions, we can always question it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| So I would ask that those two things be amended in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6275)|
| 1:44:46| Does the maker of the motion agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| Yeah, the maker agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| Second also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| Resolution 906 is directing the Knox County Purchasing Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| to investigate the cost inherent in purchasing global positioning system GPS devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| to be installed in county-owned vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Seven one no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| And the governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| The governmental voted five oh to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| And I'll make that motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| Don Troyer, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| How much will it cost to put out some type of RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| or to gather information on the cost of a GPS system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| It would be very minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| The purchasing department has already had some information compiled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| and we're glad to work at the direction of the commission on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| Yes, commissioners, I've had probably three companies contact me saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| that they would like the opportunity to bid on something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| I've told them that it would be very inappropriate for me to meet with them to do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| but that I did feel it would be appropriate for us to at least look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| Since we're not looking at a very, very minimal cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| I see no reason why we can't go ahead and just gather information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| bring it back before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| If it makes sense, we move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| If it doesn't make sense, then we don't move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| This would be for budgeting purposes for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| So I'm going to make a substitute motion that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| and ask the appropriate folks to go ahead, put it out, let these companies come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| let them present what they've got, and then come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| If it makes sense, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| If it doesn't make sense, then we don't move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| But I see no reason why we can't move ahead to gather information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| So I'll make that substitute motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| And we have several lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| Yes, Hugh Holt over at the purchasing was up here at the finance meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| and he gave us roughly a cost on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| It was pretty astronomical, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| I believe he was going to average a cost on 121 cars, 151.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| It was quite a fee and then paying to have it monitored too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| Right now, in looking at our finances for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| we're down on what we were taking in 2008 and we're way down from 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6436)|
| 1:47:23| I just don't think it's appropriate at this time for us to be spending money that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| because it looks like we're going to have a worse year this year than we had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| And I realize that everybody knows that we spent $69 million more than we took in revenue last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6454)|
| 1:47:42| and we dipped into our fund balance about $20 million, and even that we were like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| So I'm just going to have to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| Yeah, we discussed this quite a bit in our intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| We were basically told out of purchasing that it would be probably about $500 per vehicle, 151 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6481)|
| 1:48:10| It's like $75,000 initial cost and then maybe around $200 to monitor those on a monthly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6490)|
| 1:48:19| which could be anywhere from $6,500 to $8,500 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6499)|
| 1:48:26| So I feel the same way that Commissioner Pinkston does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| I don't think we're anywhere ready to spend this kind of money on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6509)|
| 1:48:35| And also to monitor that, they were talking about having to hire more employees just to monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6515)|
| 1:48:42| that you can't just pick out where that car is and you can't just go and say, where's that car right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| All the data has to be ciphered through to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| So it looks to me like it's going to be a very costly expense as to whether or not it will even benefit the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6532)|
| 1:49:02| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| What we're voting on, I think, is just gathering information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| We're not voting on actually spending any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| And I don't have a problem with just gathering information if we all are in agreement that that's a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6554)|
| 1:49:22| And I think it's a good idea just to find out exactly what the expenses will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6562)|
| 1:49:31| I understand that he made some estimations at the finance committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| but I don't think he's done any in-depth research on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| So I would like to go ahead and just get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| We're not voting on actually spending any money today, just on let's look into it and see what the real numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| Well, I know we're looking at just cost, but I can tell you right now, it's not going to be pennies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| You know, something like this, it all depends on how you do it and what technology you use to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6601)|
| 1:50:07| And it also depends on what degree of reliability you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| Yeah, there's an expensive way to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| and I'm sure there's plenty of companies that would probably give us numbers just like Mr. Holt gave us last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| But that's not the only way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| There are other more affordable ways to do exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| Most cell phone companies offer an option called Chaperone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| It's a very inexpensive monthly fee that you can add to your cell phone, most often to your kid's cell phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6636)|
| 1:50:44| so that if they leave a certain area, you'll get text messages and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6644)|
| 1:50:52| I know there are affordable technologies that can be used to acquire this kind of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| I think that when we ask county employees, and last time I checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| purchasing was a part of Knox County, to look at systems, you know, they can set criteria in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6663)|
| 1:51:10| especially if they don't like the idea of saying we want something that's 100% reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| We want something that's absolutely perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| We want a bulletproof system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| And if we're putting them on sheriff's cars, we probably do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| and I think we already have a system like that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| But if we're going to put this on employee cars to make sure that Knox County cars stay in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6689)|
| 1:51:37| then there are more affordable technologies that could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| So I think it's important that we make a request for information, that we explore this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6701)|
| 1:51:49| in an independent way, rather than just asking, because if I'm not for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| and you ask me to check it out, I can go find the most expensive option available to kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6714)|
| 1:52:02| And I think I'm not going to accuse anybody of anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| but there's a slight possibility that that may be what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| So I support Mr. Hammond's request for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| I think this was probably one of the best things that came out of our vehicles meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| We met for quite a while on those, and this was probably one of the most intelligent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| most common sense things to come out of all those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| Especially, I think someone mentioned earlier, we had a county employee that was caught in a county vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| and I think they may have even been in another county that had drugs on their person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| So I think this is something that's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| and I also think it's something that can be very affordable if the right technology is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| So I'm going to support Mr. Hammond and his request for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| And in closing, I just don't think we have anything to fear by looking for more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| The more information we have, the more intelligent votes we can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| What are we looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| You know, I think this is a case where we'll be throwing whatever size money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| We'll be throwing good money after bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| There's something really low tech called an odometer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| You know where folks live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| You know where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| You know what their day is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| You can even give them a piece of paper with lines on it and have them log where they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6810)|
| 1:53:36| Real low tech stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| Their manager can audit it once a year, which means do a cursory look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| and see if the mileage jives with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| We're talking about spending a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| and I think Commissioner Carringer's point about the tracking of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| you're going to have to have somebody, you're going to have to pay a service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| be it an ADT or somebody, to track this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| That's a cost, ongoing cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| This is, this one, you know, and if someone has drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| how are we going to know that with a GPS monitor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| You know, we'll know if they went to Kingsport and back or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| or we'll know if they went to Chattanooga and back or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| or even done a bunch of driving around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| I mean, we're going to find them at the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| We're going to find that they went to Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| We're going to find that they went to a friend's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| But that can be tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| If they're doing it in that company vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| we could do it by just looking at the mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| It's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| It goes to tenths of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| So, I mean, you know, if we really want to do this, there's ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| I just think this is a poor use of taxpayer funds, however big or small the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6881)|
| 1:54:48| This is just a really poor use of taxpayer funds to do something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6888)|
| 1:54:53| So I'm not going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| Mr. McKenzie, I believe that they have to keep a gas log| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| so you can tell whether people have to put the mileage in every time they refuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| and you can tell whether they're doing a lot of excessive driving or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| Yeah, I mean, you know, even if they were going out and purchasing their own gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| I'll offset that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| I mean, you can't fool the odometer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| Nashville, Davidson County, and other communities have gone to a GPS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| and they have estimated the savings being anywhere from 5% to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| The other thing, too, is that we already have GPS systems in effect in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| This is nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| We already have a GPS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| I think the sheriff has said he has some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| I think that they found them very effective in being able to send patrol cars to areas that they need to be quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| We just got through getting a GPS system, I believe, for our traffic engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| I didn't hear anyone raise any objections when those GPS systems were purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| I think we would all agree that those are a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| Quite frankly, if I have a take-home vehicle in Knox County, I don't want a GPS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| I mean, I certainly would not want someone coming in and looking at my log every day unless I was doing the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6961)|
| 1:56:07| and unless I was doing what I was supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| This is what we're looking at is we're just looking for another layer of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| Communities all over the country are doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| I was not here when Mr. Holt provided the figures for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| but my question to him would be and would be today, how do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| I mean, if we haven't put out a request for a proposal and we haven't had these companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| and one which has contacted me has been a cell phone company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| how do we know specifically what this is going to cost without going through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=6995)|
| 1:56:42| of allowing other companies to come in and take a look at this and bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| My guess is that we're probably looking at some of the people that maybe bid on the traffic engineering GPS system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| and so forth, but we're not asking anybody to spend any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| We're not asking anybody to spend anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| What we're asking for here is let's gather information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Let's let these companies come in and show us what they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| Let them come in and give us the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| We'll look at it, and if we feel strongly that it's not a good thing, then we won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| And if we think it is a good thing, then we can go ahead and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| I would remind you, and I think Commissioner Lambert made a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| and that is when we were looking at this in our committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| we felt like a GPS was something that should be investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| and something that should be looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| I would remind you that on the take-home vehicles, the taxpayer pays for the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7050)|
| 1:57:35| the gasoline, the brakes, the wear and tear, the insurance, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7055)|
| 1:57:43| So the taxpayers are paying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| I think that we owe it to the taxpayers, the people who are paying the bills for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| to investigate this GPS system to see if it can save us 5 to 20 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| to see if it is a means of saving their dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| And if it is, let's move ahead with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| If it's not, then let's not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| But I believe that it is in our best interest to at least look at it, put this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| let these companies come to us and say, here's what we can do for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| And, again, if it makes sense, do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| If it doesn't make sense, don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| And when we had intergovernmental, Mr. Reeves came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| and there were quite a few scary numbers that were presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| and that was the reason, I think, for the decision, our unanimous decision to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7108)|
| 1:58:36| Hearing Commissioner Hammond's explanation, I tend to agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| that there is no harm here in investigating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| It's not going to cost us any money to take a look, and we owe it to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| This is another, and I commend the committee, the vehicle committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| for all the work that they've done, and this is one result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| And so I'd be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| There's other low-tech things that we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| and we're going to be discussing those later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| So I'd agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Commissioner McKenzie, my wife has told me the same thing for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| It's got an odometer, and it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| I agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| Along with Commissioner Hammond, this is not going to cost us any money to look into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| so I'm going to support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| We'll see what the numbers are when the numbers come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| My position will be similar to what Commissioner Burroughs and some others have staked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| in that not a lot out of the county's treasury to at least explore what the numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| I was going to mention what Commissioner Lambert mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| I guess it was Mr. Mays referencing this DUI and drugs and guns in Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| If I'm not mistaken, back in the spring, there was a DUI, a guy in a DUI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| a guy with a DUI in a county truck in Loudoun County, I believe, not many months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7200)|
| 2:00:05| Probably some of you have gotten the calls I've got that county vehicles have been seen in the Dollywood parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7205)|
| 2:00:10| I mean, that's hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| But the other two examples certainly are not hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| So I think it's worth a look at to see what kind of dollars could be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| It would probably, without question, cut down on a lot of the casual driving by employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7219)|
| 2:00:27| I know they do a good job, but if you've got a vehicle and somebody else paying for the gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| you tend to not be very concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| John, do you have a follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Just to address one item from Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| Mr. Holt had surveyed through an informal request two vendors of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7243)|
| 2:00:48| two existing vendors on this to get an informal quote, and that's where the numbers came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| It was not a formal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| And so, yeah, our expectation would be there would be a higher level of competitiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| And one thing that we could also mention is that they were using 151 take-home cars under the mayor's executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7262)|
| 2:01:12| We've reduced the number, and the number is now 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| And so those numbers are a little bit lower than what we were working with last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| But, again, one item that we could do is instead of doing a request for proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7279)|
| 2:01:24| do one step less and get a request for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| And I think that would be one level less expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| and that would give you, the Commission, more information at a less cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| We have a substitute motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| Mr. Chairman, I will take Mr. Troyer's recommendation to make it a request for information rather than a RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| I guess you'd call it an RFI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| And I'll make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| Well, does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| Whoever seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| I was the second, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| Do you agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7318)|

| 2:02:06| John, do you know roughly what that process will cost the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7326)|
| 2:02:13| It will be well within the purchasing budget and just something that purchasing does on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7333)|

| 2:04:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| Is there anyone for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| First discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| This first item is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| Can I ask something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| Just a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| Sometimes rumors start on these floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| We have never thought about selling the Solway location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| And, of course, if we ever did, we'd come back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| As a matter of fact, we're investing now in sewer lines for the retention pond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| So I just heard that comment made here earlier in order to make sure no one picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| and even thought we were thinking about selling Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| Of course, if we ever did, you'd be the first ones to ask how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| Mike, that's one reason I just wanted to turn and do it because the guy that said that to me was very reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| So I just wanted to give you all a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| And I figured that's what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| You wouldn't sell anything without coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| So that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| Hugh Holt has a 102-degree temperature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| He's not dodging you guys today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| Sounds like John needs to go home as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| He needs to go home as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7522)|
| 2:05:52| I thought that was something we could only do with an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7552)|
| 2:06:00| Which one are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| Mr. McKay, did you have something that you wanted to say on 909?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| We've done approved it, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| Yeah, but I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| I thought that it could only be done through an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| I didn't think you could do it through resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| We don't have anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| We're asking them to look into it and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| They're just going to research it and report back to us and then we'll get into writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| I think there's certain things that we need to discuss on this because somebody can write it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| but we have to tell them what we want in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| You know, I think that's important because there's problems with the other recall the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7603)|
| 2:06:49| Can I take just a moment to discuss a little bit of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| Because I think these are things that are very important if it's in order now, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7611)|
| 2:06:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| And I invite Mr. McKay, who is the, I guess you call him the director of the election commission or chairman or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7618)|
| 2:07:07| Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| Director of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| Administrator of elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| I got the title right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| He's sort of the guy that does all the work down there and runs things anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7632)|
| 2:07:17| Let me just, and I invite you, Mr. McKay, just to go ahead and correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| I've pulled some of this off both the state constitution, the state codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| and these are some of the things that we need to consider in the recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| And I think it's important for us to discuss this because it's not that the election commission can just draw this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| and be approved by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| We have to decide what we want in it because we do have some flexibility on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| I'm going to give you just a couple of facts, and I have posted these on the commission forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| One of the questions came up is that when can you do a general election for a county election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| Because, as you recall, usually the county general elections occur in even-numbered years in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7673)|
| 2:08:00| But there has been an opinion from the state attorney general that the November election can serve as a general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7680)|
| 2:08:07| for a recall referendum or initiatives at the county level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7687)|
| 2:08:12| Also, before a petition for recall can be circulated, a registered voter or a group of registered voters must file the petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7692)|
| 2:08:19| with the county election commission for certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| The county election commission must certify the petition within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| Now, I'm going to mention some numbers here because it's important when you have certain limits by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7707)|
| 2:08:34| when things can go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| So these numbers are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| After a petition is submitted, the election commission must certify it within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| If defects are documented by the election commission, the individual or group has 15 days to cure any of the defects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7723)|
| 2:08:51| The election commission shall then determine within five days whether or not the revised document shall be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7731)|
| 2:08:59| State law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| Again, state law requires for the petition for recall to be signed by 15% of the registered voters in the county or election district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7740)|
| 2:09:10| The completed petition for recall must be filed with the election commission within 75 days after final certification of proper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7750)|
| 2:09:19| Again, this is state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| A petition for recall must be filed within 60 days of a general election for the recall to be placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7761)|
| 2:09:28| Now, the same law that states those things, there's two areas of flexibility that a county or a city with a charter may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7768)|
| 2:09:38| The first is that the statutory number of signatures required on a petition may be provided by the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| In other words, the local government has the discretion in the charter for fewer or a greater percentage of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7784)|
| 2:09:52| The state required 15% of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| We can change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| And then the second item that can be changed is the provisions related to the 75-day deadline for filing the petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7795)|
| 2:10:02| after certification by the election commission may also be altered by the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7802)|
| 2:10:08| In other words, the charter may allow a longer period of time to collect the signatures if we desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| Is that your interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7814)|
| 2:10:15| Is that correct so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| It's excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| Yes, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| So I think that as we do this, now another point to remember is that there's only one time when we can have a recall election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7819)|
| 2:10:30| And that will be if we have elections every two years, it's going to be in the August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7830)|
| 2:10:37| which is two years after that particular individual has been elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| That's the only time you can have a recall election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| And the only time you can have an election to replace that person is in that November general election immediately after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7844)|
| 2:10:55| Now, a couple of things that we need to decide on, there's some other ways you can do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| but I think that's probably the essence of how this needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| There's two things that we can decide that we probably need some input as we draw this new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| and ultimately an amendment that will be voted on by the voters is that we need to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| do we want to, what do we want the number of signatures to be for a recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7877)|
| 2:11:25| I've also listed on the commission forum what other states have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| Just to run through some of these, and I won't go through all of them because it will be listed in the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7890)|
| 2:11:37| we probably have one of the most difficult thresholds to reach because of the number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7897)|
| 2:11:44| And I won't go through all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| There's a lot of states that require 25% of the votes cast in the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| A few require as few as 15% in the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| As you recall, I believe we passed a charter amendment at the last election that said for referendum items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| and for charter amendments it would be 15% of the signatures of the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| And I think one of the things we have to decide is how many signatures do we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| I've talked to several people and I think Commissioner Lambert over here was involved in collecting signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7933)|
| 2:12:21| dealing with the wheel tax a couple of years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| And the 40,000 plus signatures that would probably, that would have to be obtained in order to get the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7944)|
| 2:12:32| to put this issue for recall on the ballot is very difficult, if not impossible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7952)|
| 2:12:39| for a citizen's group to do on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| As you recall, the people with the charter petition group had to hire outside companies to come in and pay them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7962)|
| 2:12:50| So unless a group had fairly substantial financial resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| they would run into difficulty in attempting to collect the number of signatures in that short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7975)|
| 2:13:01| So one thing we have to decide on, how many signatures do we want to require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| Second thing that we need to do is what is the time limit we want to allow them to circulate the petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7986)|
| 2:13:12| before the deadline comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| The state law said 75 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| The present recall amendment that we have that's got problems with it says 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| And so I think those are the two issues that we have to decide as we draw this thing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| Mr. McKay, are there any other issues that you think that we need to look at as we compose the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8009)|
| 2:13:37| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| And I want you to keep in mind you referred to the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| That's a separate law and that's 10 percent of the gubernatorial when you do the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| So they were able to reach that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| One of the biggest concerns we see, if a constitutional officer is recalled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8033)|
| 2:14:01| then the state law specifies that there will be the recall election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| which would presumably be in August or in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| Then at the next general election, the successor will be chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| And it does not allow for a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| So that the parties would choose, however, whatever system they have in place to present a nominee to the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8055)|
| 2:14:22| they would choose the nominees for their party and anybody who wanted to run as an independent could do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| And at the next election, a successor will be chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| There's only one officer in Knox County that could be recalled that's not a constitutional officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| and that's the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| So this would only apply to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| The way it is now, the charter specifies that 90 to 95 days after the recall election is certified by the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8078)|
| 2:14:49| there will be an election for a primary for the successor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| followed by another election for the election, the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| Well, 90 to 95 days is such a narrow window and it's too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| For example, if there was something on next August ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| it would put us past the November election of 2010 and into the week of Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8106)|
| 2:15:11| So we would be having a governor's race, a full-blown countywide race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8111)|
| 2:15:17| November 2nd, November 3rd, and then three weeks later have another election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| So I would think that it would be wise to change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| The question you've got to decide is whether you want a primary or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| And this is just for the law director because if anybody else gets recalled, there will not be a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| There will just be a general election at the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| And there's only two general elections there, August and November of even years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| Thank you very much for bringing that forward because that was the big issue or one of the major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| where there were several problems with the recall amendment as it's presently stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| And you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| And I assume that what we want to do both for cost and to avoid the special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8150)|
| 2:15:57| And, you know, personally, if I had my druthers, I would like to do it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| But he's absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8162)|
| 2:16:03| For us to have the general election, which will either be a presidential election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| or a gubernatorial election in those even years in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| the parties would have to pick their nominee to place on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| And anyone else that wanted to run would have to run as an independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| And the question came up that I had, well, why couldn't we list three Republicans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| and three Democrats and whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| You cannot do that in a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| So the parties would have to have a convention or whatever mechanism they determined to pick their nominee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| and anyone else who wanted to run that wasn't the nominee of their party would need to run as an independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8196)|
| 2:16:43| And that's to avoid having a primary election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| Well, it's because, yeah, that's what the state law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| And the state law specifies constitutional offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| and so you're really only deciding what to do about the successor election for the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| if they were to be recalled in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| As far as anybody else being recalled, state law is going to trump what the charter says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| and it says that the next general election without a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| And, I mean, I think that what we need to do is that, and it's really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| we have this now in the first paragraph, I believe, of our recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8232)|
| 2:17:21| It's paragraph A is it tells which offices that the recall is applicable to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8241)|
| 2:17:28| and we do include the law director there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| And I think we need to list those all again just to make it absolutely clear and have consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| Yeah, and I think there's a line in there about a primary too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| Yeah, that's down further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| That's in paragraph H, but we need to do away with that, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| and state that the parties will choose their nominees and essentially independents can run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8264)|
| 2:17:52| But then we'll need to say nothing and let the state law take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| We're just going to do exactly what state law says, even with reference to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| There's a number of ways to word it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| It's a policy decision that we don't make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| I mean, you would make that, whether to have a primary or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| And there's other small things that the number's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| If you're going to change it, you might as well make it the right number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| It says 705, and it should be 805.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| That was another problem is that they put on the ordinance, this was almost a technical error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8299)|
| 2:18:27| They numbered it wrong on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| It's really 805 and not 705.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| And there was other problems in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| There were two questions, and you can't ask two questions on a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| I mean, we need to clear that all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| But I think that the guidance that the Election Commission and the Office of the Law Director needs is really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8318)|
| 2:18:47| I guess there's three questions now, number of votes required on the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| the amount of time the petition can circulate before it has to be submitted back to the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8331)|
| 2:18:59| to certify the signatures, and then the third thing is whether or not to have a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| And I feel very strongly that we should not because it would require great expense in a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8345)|
| 2:19:13| Is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| Commissioner Ivan Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| I just wanted to apologize to Greg and Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| I did ask for this to be moved up, but evidently it got shifted in the argument somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8362)|
| 2:19:29| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| You can't move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| We actually approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| We're just now discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| I was one of the sponsors to put the recall initiative out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8380)|
| 2:19:46| and I believe that the citizens should have the ability to recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| I am a little concerned about adjusting the number of signatures, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| Recall should not be something that we have between every election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| It shouldn't be something that is done often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| It should be done in those very rare circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| So I don't believe recall should be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| I think it should be possible, but I think it should be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| I mean, it should not be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| People should not be recalling on a whim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| And so I think that we need to stick with the number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| What's good for the goose is good for the gander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| Let's keep it exactly the same as state law dictates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| Because if we change it now to make it easier because, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| we've got some folks that are angry with Mr. Lockett and they want to make it easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| well, we on this legislative body have all made decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8444)|
| 2:20:50| that have made a percentage of our constituents mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| What happens for a county-wide office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| the percentages are going to remain the same for district-level offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| If we make it too easy, then I think we're going to have commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8463)|
| 2:21:10| and councilmen and district-level office holders being recalled left and right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8470)|
| 2:21:17| This should be something that the citizens have the ability to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| but this should not be something so easy that it's done on a whim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| And I want to tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| I've worked a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| People will sign anything you put in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| They see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| You're collecting signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| They're happy to sign because you want them to, and they don't even think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| So it's a whole lot easier to get signatures than most people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| I was the other sponsor of recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| And my point of view is within the same ballpark, but a slightly different goalpost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| I mean, I understand that it shouldn't be easy, but it shouldn't be inordinately difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| Fifteen percent of the total electorate or ten percent, even ten percent of the total electorate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| is a very large number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| I think a standard, something between the goalposts of ten to fifteen percent of the gubernatorial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| would be a difficult but obtainable standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| I don't know if I see heads nodding on that or people trying to calculate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| But something like that would be a reasonable standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| And I hope that when we do get advice, it comes back somewhere in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8552)|
| 2:22:40| We agree, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| I'm in agreement with Mr. Lambert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| We need to keep the numbers the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| Most people will sign anything that's put in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| And you have to remember, people now are saying they didn't realize what they were voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8573)|
| 2:23:00| when they brought this commission down to 11 members and redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8580)|
| 2:23:05| We're getting all kinds of complaints on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| So we don't need to just make these things very simple, like Commissioner Lambert said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| I'm for keeping the numbers like they are and staying with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| Commissioner Briggs, where are we with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| I guess I'm confused on where we need to move on from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| Well, I mean, there was no need to do anything until we had the consent of the commission to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8607)|
| 2:23:33| So we haven't done anything because, I mean, I didn't want to do something that no one wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8613)|
| 2:23:38| And then the other part, we really couldn't go forward until we decided what numbers we want on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8618)|
| 2:23:44| You know, what's the percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| How many days does the petition circulate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| And do we want to have a primary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| There's actually a fourth one, and I feel it's not as important now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| as whether you wait six months before you can start the petition or you wait a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| Right now the recall amendment says a year, but it's going to be two years before you can vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8639)|
| 2:24:06| because it will be in that even number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| And you're still only going to have the same number of days to circulate the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| So I don't think that's quite as important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| I know many people felt that they wanted to start a petition immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| when the law director issue came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| But, I mean, if we'd have done this, you know, six months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| you're still not going to vote on it until next August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| But to answer your question, we haven't done anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| because we have to find out what's the, as so eloquently as said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| the wisdom of the commission on this as far as the number of the people we want on signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| and how long do we want the petition to circulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| And whether to have a primary or not have a primary, which I think personally is a bad idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| and it's very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| We'll just have to go with the election in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| if the recall is successful in a general election in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| I'm wondering, Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman, if it would be appropriate to ask Commissioner Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| to meet with the Election Commission and give us some recommendations at our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| Something for us to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| Well, I mean, we can do it, but I think somewhere, don't we, Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| We just need to know what percentage of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| If everyone wants to leave it the way it is, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| Do we need to have a workshop on that to iron it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| Well, I mean, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| No, I mean, I'm just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8729)|
| 2:25:30| We're going to need to get something in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| and I'm wondering if it would be appropriate for you to go ahead and get together with Mr. McKay or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8732)|
| 2:25:36| just to bring us something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| Yeah, actually, we've already talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| I can go ahead and bring an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8741)|
| 2:25:42| But see, what I don't want to do is to bring an ordinance that we bring forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| and then someone says, I really wanted 75 days and not 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| and it gets voted down because once that ordinance is voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| then I don't think we can bring it up for a certain amount of time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| You know, we need to have some consensus when we bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8757)|
| 2:26:02| Well, we can offer amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| I mean, I don't care how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| You know, I have pretty strong feelings about how this should be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| and what the threshold should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| And if we have a vote here tonight to make a recommendation to Mr. McKay to put in the original ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8776)|
| 2:26:23| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| Or if he wants to bring whatever he brings, then I'll offer it as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| I think that on most of the other points, especially the point about having a primary and a general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8790)|
| 2:26:37| I think on a lot of the other points that I do want to make the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| But from the very beginning, when I put this on the agenda, I fought for it to be possible but not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8801)|
| 2:26:50| I will continue to do that, whether I do that tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| or whether I do that by offering an amendment at the time it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| So either way, I don't think it really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8818)|
| 2:27:03| Is everyone happy with the 15% of registered voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| I mean, do we really want to debate that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| I don't have an opinion, yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| I just want to know what to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| Let's actually ask, can you do some back of the envelope calculations, Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| 15% of the registered voters is what number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| We did that on the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| It's about 38,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| Close to 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| Close to 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| And 15% of the turnout in the last gubernatorial will be what difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| 18,370.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| So the difference between 18,000 and 38,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| Actually 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| It's important to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| Mr. McKay, could you break that down to a district for lack of, I'll offer my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8861)|
| 2:27:48| could you break that down and tell me what numbers would be required to recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| either myself or Mr. Anders and the 6th District under both scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8874)|
| 2:27:58| and you'll see what my concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| I guess if you divide it by nine, 18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| That would be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| I mean, we could go through precinct by precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| I can tell you, but right off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| I'm just saying that if we go down to the numbers that Mr. Harmon wants to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8892)|
| 2:28:18| it's going to get to the point where, especially in district-level legislative positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8898)|
| 2:28:23| Still, Dr. Harmon, keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| It's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8905)|
| 2:28:31| It's still going to be to the point to where it will be so easy to recall a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| or a school board member that we will be having elections so frequently that it will bankrupt this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8917)|
| 2:28:46| I'm just saying that it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8926)|
| 2:28:47| No, your elections will not be any more frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| No, but you'll have more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| No, you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| It can only happen on an August or a November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| It can only happen on an August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| But then if someone's recalled, how long have you got to, you have the special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| No, see, if you're recalled in the August election, the replacement will be in November of even number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8942)|
| 2:29:11| And the recall is on even number of years because we don't have general elections on odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| I'm just saying that it will be, if it gets too easy to recall someone, it's not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8955)|
| 2:29:23| It is not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| We're going to put just about everybody running every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| We just had guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| That was very passionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| Now, we had some of you folks that voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| I have a database of every handgun carry permit holder in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| Don't you think that I could go out to your district and find a number of them that would sign a petition to have you recalled right now because folks are angry about how you voted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8980)|
| 2:29:51| I'm sure that you could find enough people that disagree with me on that issue to where you could fill a petition on myself if a recall petition was offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=8991)|
| 2:30:03| If this is too easy, then it is going to be a constant recall frenzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9003)|
| 2:30:09| Okay, we're going to, Commissioner Shouse had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| I'm going to allow him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| Mine's a little bit off the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| I was going to ask Dr. Briggs, in your research and the dialogue you went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| this all pertains to the Lockett recall initiative and not to the school board member recall initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9021)|
| 2:30:28| No, let me pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| I've got the, this is 805 right here, and this is paragraph A, which we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9030)|
| 2:30:36| And I think we need to retain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| It says the recall provision is applicable only to the officials holding the positions of Knox County Mayor, County Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9038)|
| 2:30:45| Law Director, Sheriff, County Clerk, Trustee, Register of the Deeds, Property Assessors, and members of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9045)|
| 2:30:52| The judicial branch, including court clerks, are not subject to recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| That, the school board situation is not something that needs to be adjudicated by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| See, it's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9063)|
| 2:31:04| It's not an issue, and I think this is correct, Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| It's not an issue here because those are nonpartisan elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9070)|
| 2:31:11| And see, the problem is here is because these, all those other officers are partisan elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| is that the way we wrote this, it would require a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| Yeah, well, yes, it doesn't, it won't affect the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9079)|
| 2:31:24| It won't affect anybody but the law director, because there won't be a primary for any other office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| If anybody gets recalled except the law director, according to state law, there will not be a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9089)|
| 2:31:34| The next general election, you'll choose the successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| Question for you, Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| If someone is recalled in, let's say, August and the election is not until November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9102)|
| 2:31:51| does then the county commission need to appoint until that special election to fill the recalled position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9111)|
| 2:31:59| I think the charter says that they may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| They may, but we wouldn't necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| Now, if they're recalled in the November, there is no election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| For two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9129)|
| 2:32:10| For two years, but that's the end of the term because it's already two years in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9130)|
| 2:32:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| So then an appointment would be necessary just to at least have some official in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9138)|
| 2:32:24| It's moot if it's the end of the term, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| No, you can recall them to get that official out in November, but you would not be able to fill it with an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| You can only fill it through an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9154)|
| 2:32:39| The charter requires you to fill all positions that you are essentially required to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| In such a case as this, it would be implied that you would make the appointment for that interim period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| For an interim period, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| Is it clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| Clear as mud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| Who's on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| I think what we're going to have to do is the election commission is going to come up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9177)|
| 2:33:04| They're going to present it to us, and then we'll debate it and hammer out what we wish to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9184)|
| 2:33:10| and then send it on to the people to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9190)|
| 2:33:13| Just a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| Are we to start the process or the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| If you could work that out with the law department and work together to get that before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9198)|
| 2:33:25| We could come up with options for you for the policy part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9205)|
| 2:33:30| We'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| I'm sorry, what was the question on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| He was going to work with the law department to get started on writing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9215)|
| 2:33:40| I just wanted to make sure we weren't trying to write it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9220)|
| 2:33:43| We're not lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| But the point, how many days do we want to take to resubmit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| State law says 75 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| The present recall amendment says 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| Do we want to leave the 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9232)|
| 2:33:54| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9234)|
| 2:33:55| I mean, Commissioner Briggs, we can debate those things when they bring us the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| in either next month or the month or whenever they bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| Or are you wanting to debate those tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9245)|
| 2:34:06| Well, I mean, it just saves time if we've reached a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| I'm not sure I'm ready to make a decision on those items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9249)|
| 2:34:15| I think it's best to let them bring it forward, have a chance to go through the committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9255)|
| 2:34:21| and bring it to the regular commission and let it be ironed out that way would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| What I would suggest we do is, just because it's in the amendment now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9266)|
| 2:34:31| is use the 15 percent of the registered voters on that part and use the 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9271)|
| 2:34:36| which we have in there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| That is a little at variance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| I mean, it's completely legal, but we can leave that like that and then do away with the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9280)|
| 2:34:45| Well, if you do nothing, then that's what will remain is what's in there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| the 90 days and the 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| No, yeah, but if we do nothing, we have to have a primary and a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9294)|
| 2:34:55| Yeah, so I'm saying we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9295)|
| 2:34:56| I think we have to change it, and we also have to get rid of the two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| But I would just do it so everything is consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9299)|
| 2:35:03| Use the 15 percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| Use the 90 days to have the petition circulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9307)|
| 2:35:10| Do away with the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| And I think that would make it a recall amendment that's not expensive and legally correct, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9313)|
| 2:35:21| And then if we want to change something on those other two, then we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9321)|
| 2:35:27| But that will give us a working document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| Thank you very much for waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9333)|
| 2:35:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| Are we into discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| Mr. Chairman, I'll hand it back over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9343)|
| 2:35:49| This is a discussion regarding the stormwater review process and the Laurel Cove property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9349)|
| 2:35:56| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| Into commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| Being a governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| If I vote, it's into commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9365)|
| 2:36:09| Do you want to go first, Bud, or do you want me to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| Obviously, we're in need, given all the discussion that we've had about Ms. Cole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9374)|
| 2:36:21| and the various other stormwater issues that we've had in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| and has been suggested since the time that our ordinance was rewritten on stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9386)|
| 2:36:37| The review of it is a component of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9397)|
| 2:36:44| Now, it hasn't been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| And so we've been talking about it and sort of talking around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9406)|
| 2:36:52| and, of course, referencing Ms. Cole's farm for several months and some of the shortcomings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9412)|
| 2:36:58| And so I just wanted it to be discussed by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9418)|
| 2:37:04| and for us to hopefully form a motion tonight to ask for a committee to be formed to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9424)|
| 2:37:18| I think that certainly we've got a lot of people that have been involved in stormwater in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9438)|
| 2:37:26| Some of those interested bodies would be, of course, leading with Mr. Gronshue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| and our county stormwater department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| I hope these are people that are involved in forming a committee, these groups that I'm about to list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9457)|
| 2:37:45| And I think it would be my wish that the committee, we could, I could work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9465)|
| 2:37:53| and Mr. Armstrong, any commissioner that's interested in this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9473)|
| 2:37:57| could work with Mr. Gronshue in forming the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9477)|
| 2:38:02| or making suggestions to commission to form the committee in the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9482)|
| 2:38:07| and bring that back to you in the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| Some other folks that I think will be involved, want to be involved, besides Ms. Cole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9491)|
| 2:38:17| but departmentally or group-wise would be the MPC, Water Quality Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9497)|
| 2:38:26| the former Stormwater Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9506)|
| 2:38:31| All of these folks should be, I think, invited to the table in the formation of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9511)|
| 2:38:38| So what I would like to do is, and in talking to Mr. Gronshue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9518)|
| 2:38:45| the wording of the motion would be something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| like make a motion to review our Knox County Stormwater Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9530)|
| 2:38:55| and the planning process for all land development activities in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9535)|
| 2:39:02| And so I'm going to make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| And again, the purpose of it is to use the next month to form a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9546)|
| 2:39:15| invite all interested parties, commissioners included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| And Ms. Cole, you may want to speak to that if you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| You're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9565)|
| 2:39:26| And Mr. Armstrong, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| First off, I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| I think we have a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| I think the Stormwater Advisory Board's recommendations for 2007 are a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9578)|
| 2:39:48| I think the people that worked on that put in a lot of work, a lot of thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9588)|
| 2:39:54| and a lot of good recommendations that probably need to be looked at in terms of our current ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9594)|
| 2:40:01| Also, I think that something that needs to be looked at in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| is that we actually put together some strict procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| and steps along the way where we may need environmental bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| where we may need construction bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| where we may need even some engineering approval steps along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9615)|
| 2:40:20| in our construction processes that we haven't had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| So I think we need to look at both product and process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| and procedural elements as we're relating to our ordinances in terms of stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| But I'm going to second Commissioner Norman's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9633)|
| 2:40:39| and I'll be willing to work on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9639)|
| 2:40:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9648)|
| 2:40:52| You know, I work for the City Stormwater Department, and we've got a great department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9652)|
| 2:40:56| I think Tony's showed interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| Maybe when I retire he'll take my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| But, you know, the thing we've got to look at is the enforcement of the stormwater ordinance we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| We've got a great county stormwater ordinance, but we're not enforcing some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| We had a situation out on Cherry Brook off of Clinton Highway, poorly designed situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9670)|
| 2:41:17| and some of the other commissioners I think have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| With a few visits with the stormwater people and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| I think we've got that job solutions resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| Enforcement is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9689)|
| 2:41:30| People have to go out and investigate these fields and see what these developers are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| and make sure they're doing it the proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| I think we can set up an ordinance, but if we don't follow up on it and make them do it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9697)|
