| 0:04:01| because Mayor Rojero is in Washington, D.C., along with two other mayors who are participating in the National League of Cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=241)|
| 0:04:10| briefing for the Congressional staff and with key U.S. Senators on how the opioid epidemic is impacting our cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| a very important activity she's involved in and certainly could benefit our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| But anyhow, for the report this evening, it's really something I wanted to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| and I'm going to talk all about the zoning recode update that is going on and has been going on for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=269)|
| 0:04:39| We're hearing from a great number of citizens as we continue the thorough and thoughtful process of updating this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| This is the first thorough review of the city's zoning in over 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| and the new code that comes out of this process will serve as our blueprint going forward for protecting and enhancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| Knoxville's sense of place. It's an important and exciting exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| The aim is to strike the right balance between protecting the unique and historic characteristics of our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| and creating standards that encourage quality growth and affordability and appropriate density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| Community outreach for recode in Knoxville began about a year and a half ago in May of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| More than 55 community meetings have been held, and more than 750 comments have been received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| and evaluated as MPC staff and consultants continue to update the proposed draft of the ordinance to reflect the input that they're receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=331)|
| 0:05:41| All these public comments are available to view online at www.recodenoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=341)|

| 0:06:04| Speaking for myself, and I hope for my colleagues, we welcome and value your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=364)|

| 0:06:18| The third draft of the proposed code and the second draft of the proposed zoning map will be presented at the upcoming public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=378)|

| 0:12:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=770)|

| 0:12:52| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| I'd like to invite Potentate Terry Vitito and the Shriners to come up to the podium for us for just a quick second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| While they're moving in that direction, I just wanted to say that the Corbella Shrine Circus began performing in Knoxville in 1977,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=784)|
| 0:13:13| and over the decades they've been entertaining more than 200 or 2 million of our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| This year the circus will be held October the 12th through the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| This resolution recognizes the 42nd year and more than 200 performances of the circus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| Corbella Shriners have been passionate servants in our community since 1915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| Over the last 20 years they've contributed over $10 million to Shriners Hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| supporting approximately 1,000 children in our community to receive treatment in 22 nationwide Shrine Hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=823)|
| 0:13:51| covering travel expenses to Chicago, St. Louis, Lexington, Cincinnati, among other locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| which is provided free of charge for those without insurance or the means to pay for their care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| In appreciation of the service of the Corbella Shriners that provided our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| and in recognition of this 200th performance of the Shriners Circus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| I'm really happy to bring this resolution and wanted to invite the Potentate to say anything if he wanted at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=855)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you, Councilman Roberto, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| If you would please give us your name and address, and you make some remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Yes, Mr. Vice Mayor, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, it is a pleasure to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=871)|

| 0:15:24| Our chief raban, the man that will be in my position next year, noble Billy Pappas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=924)|

| 0:15:59| Motion and a second, but we do need to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| So everybody in favor, please indicate by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| 11B is the resolution in support of reauthorization of and full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| We have one person signed up to speak on this, Carter Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| If you would like to come forward, thank you for being with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| And please give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| My name is Carter Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| I live at 223 Eastcott Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| I want to thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders, and thank you to the council for hearing me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| My name is Carter Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| I'm here with the Wilderness Society today talking to you about the resolution in support of full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| and permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| The Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the most successful programs for preserving our country's irreplaceable public lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| For a little bit of background, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was passed in 1965,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| so it's been around for around 70 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| The program works essentially by taking money from offshore gas and oil drilling permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| and making an accessible fund that governments at multiple levels, federal, state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| and municipal levels can use to help develop and improve public lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| So because of the way it's funded, it doesn't cost a penny for taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| Over its 70 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has provided Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| with more than 750 statewide grants to local governments, totaling more than $73 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| At the federal level, this funding has extended to public lands such as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| the Appalachian Trail, and the Obed Wild and Scenic River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Locally, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has provided funds for the Knoxville Zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Morningside Park, Westview Park, and a lot of other of our public spaces here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| Knoxville has received over $1.8 million in funding over its 70 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| and this is the Knoxville city limits. This doesn't include Knox County and Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| You include those in, the number goes up a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| So over its 70 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has received renewal and reauthorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| for a handful of years at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| Usually, Congress will pass a four- or five-year extension to the Land and Water Conservation Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| and then reauthorize it again when its expiration date comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| Unfortunately, this year, on September 30th, so a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Congress failed to reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and the program expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| Instead of being due to a lot of the partisan issues that we see going on in Congress today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| this was really just due to the Land and Water Conservation Fund incorrectly not being placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| with a high enough priority in Congress, and we believe that this resolution tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| will help that priority issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| We've already seen after the expiration date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Congress has been moving to try to address the issue of expiration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| On October 2nd, permanent reauthorization was passed out of the Senate Subcommittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| on Energy and Natural Resources, with Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander voting yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| on that program to come out of the subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| The House will also pick back up work on reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| when they come back from recess, but this does put us at an important time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| for making sure that Congress recognizes the value of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| All that background on where this program is in Congress is really just to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| that we're at a moment right now where the Land and Water Conservation Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| permanent reauthorization is really we're at the height of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| and we believe that this resolution will help send a message to Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| along with many other cities that have passed resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| including the United States Council of Mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| We know that Knoxville is a community steeped not just in culture and an economy of public lands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| but it's a city that has garnered influence over public lands policy that is recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| and the importance of permanent reauthorization coming out of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| means a lot for those folks up in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| By voting yes on this resolution, you can send a message that we are not just going to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| the long history of Knoxville and a history that's been built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| helped using the Land and Water Conservation Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| but you'll also be protecting an invaluable fund to continue the future growth of our public lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| and protection of the places of why we love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Thank you, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Are there any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| If not, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| Do you have any other comments, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1238)|

| 0:23:31| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Good afternoon, members of Council and Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| Ann Wallace, Office of Redevelopment for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| I'm pleased to say that we are still on target for meeting our completion date in March of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| The project was scheduled to be about 18 months in terms of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| We started in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I'm sorry, 15 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| We started in January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| What we found as we were getting into construction, two things really impacted the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| and are what are presented in the items before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| One, the street depth varied significantly when we got in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and actually tore it out to put the new stormwater line in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| And in the interest of making sure that there was enough sub-base for the new street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| once we tucked that stormwater line in where it belonged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| we actually had to increase our quantities significantly on the asphalt mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| And you'll see that that's the largest cost item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| It's a little over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| And there was really no way to know that until we got out into the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| that those quantities would be increased so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| We have looked at some adjustments to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| and found some solutions to help reduce the cost going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| Instead of doing six to eight inches of binder mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| we've found some compromises where we can find an appropriate layer of stone underneath that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| and then reduce the overall quantities going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| But unfortunately, that street being as old as it is, having gone in in the late 1800s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| you just don't know what you're going to get until you open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| That was true, too, of installing the stormwater line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| where we had to dig through a lot more rock than was expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| and so those trenches had to be wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Again, being able to replace the vitrified clay pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| and put in a new concrete-reinforced pipe at a larger diameter to handle the stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| meant more excavation, and with the rock surrounding the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| meant more time and backfilling that had to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| So we're on schedule, though, even with this increased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| Yeah, we've been able to stay on schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| We're just over 50% complete right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| We're currently working at the intersection of Baxter and Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| which unfortunately we're knocking on your door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| Sorry for the inconvenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I had to go around a road closure this morning to get my lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Yes, and we are in coordination with KEB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| They're actually doing some gas line work in Baxter right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| in order to set the stage for finishing out the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| Unfortunately, with the age of the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| it's not surprising to see this type of change order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| and we may bump into another change order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| but we're doing our best to try and offset costs where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| You'll see there was a reduction in costs for the street print,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| and that's been incorporated into this change order as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1578)|

| 0:31:51| I'll try to summarize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| The major road plan identifies roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| within Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| classifying them in categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| ranging from major collector to local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| That categorization is based on the alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| the right-of-way, the traffic capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| the traffic volumes, and certain other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Based on that classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| there's a right-of-way assigned to that street or road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| but anything above a local street level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| has that right-of-way designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Then as part of the subdivision review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| if there's property subdivided along those streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| and there's not existing right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| to meet that designated amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| there is a right-of-way designation required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| That provides an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| for future widening of those roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| and provision of other mobility assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| such as sidewalks or bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1966)|

| 0:33:05| to prepare that major road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| and the subdivision regulations refer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| There are also a number of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| provisions in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| which state that certain types of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| are required to be on a certain classification of road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| whether arterial, typically arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| or collector is the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| on which the minimum classification must exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| for that development to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| There are a number of other details in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| with regard to the description of roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| the profile or cross-section of roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| depending on whether it's a collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| arterial, or a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| That tries to sum it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| but if you have further questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| I didn't give you enough information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Well, I guess the reason I brought it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| was looking through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| I saw that Broom Road was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| from a major collector to a minor collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| and I know, Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| you and I have talked about Broom Road a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| and I know Director Hagerman and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| have talked about Broom Road a few times as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| So I was just curious about that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| and what are we seeing with that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| And that change reflects the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| Since you brought up Mr. Hagerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| MPC staff worked with both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| the City of Knoxville Engineering Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| and the Knox County Engineering Public Works Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| in coming up with the classifications for the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| In the case of Broom Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| we looked at the alignment, the existing right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| the current traffic volumes on that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| the potential to accommodate additional traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| and as a result of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| it was one of those streets where the classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| was reduced from, in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| major collector to minor collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| What that may have an impact on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| is the type of development that could be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| on that road in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Does it have any impact on the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| traffic that we could assume on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| or what you're looking at with capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| with through traffic on that road by this designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| In reality, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| because regardless of the classification of a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| if someone wants to drive along it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| if they feel it's a shortcut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| or an alternate route that they prefer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| we can't limit the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| What we can do is try to limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| the intensity of land uses along that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| so that we're not, through development activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| adding traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| or consciously adding traffic to that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| And I don't know if this is more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| for Director Hagerman or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| but are we, in doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| are we encouraging more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| or more through traffic on Broom Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| or is this neutral in that aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| or is this actually discouraging more traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| Because its classification was lowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| from major to minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| we're recognizing it's more limited capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| to carry traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Again, we can take certain steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| to limit through traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| short of, I don't think the city's prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| to put a toll gate on either end of Broom Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| or build a wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| and require a mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| that only residents of Broom Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| can travel that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| and that's one of the challenges that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| in looking at road systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| We can't restrict the public rights-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| and public roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| but we can, as I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| because of that reduced classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| limit the amount of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| that is approved along it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| so that we don't add to the traffic generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| on the road itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| So would it be fair to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| that this designation makes it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| to reduce through traffic on Broom Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| It provides an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| to reduce traffic generated on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Again, reducing through traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| there are so many variables that dictate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| that we find it difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| to limit the through traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| all those variables that come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| would dictate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| So we're not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| that it will reduce through traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| but it's creating a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| where because of the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| of the downgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| from major collector to minor collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| it could have the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| of making it easier to reduce traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| It could, and it could reduce, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| reduce those more intense land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| that would generate traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| from locating along that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Are there any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Councilman Roberto, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181009?start=2281)|
