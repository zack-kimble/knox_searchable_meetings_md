| 0:08:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=480)|

| 0:08:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Moving on to special recognition of Ridgedale School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Dr. Reiswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| Go ahead, Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=497)|
| 0:08:29| Just give me one minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=509)|
| 0:08:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| We have one of our schools, Ridgedale School, Ms. Diana Gossett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| who is our principal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| And the State Department is here to recognize them for an exemplary award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| that they were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| So I'll turn it over to her to explain the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| I'm Pat Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| I'm the Executive Director of the Office of Student Support for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Tennessee Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| And within my shop, I have the honor of being over alternative education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| programs in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| And in 2017, we have a Governor's Alternative Education Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| And in 2017, we partnered with the Tennessee Alt-Ed Association to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| establish an exemplary program for alternative education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| And those standards, not many people know alternative schools have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| standards for alternative education that include relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| skill development, just a myriad of standards that they live up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| And so in our program, we call it the Exemplary Programs and Practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| and Alternative Education Recognition Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| It's by application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| Schools apply to be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| After the schools apply, the advisory board screens those applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| and then selects the schools to participate in that site visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| We went to Ridgedale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| And I have to tell you guys, you have Jewel in Ridgedale Alternative School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| Diana Gossett and her team run an excellent program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| And I just want to give you some quick highlights of what we saw there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| Not only did we see an educational opportunity for middle school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| that have received some type of long-term suspension or expulsion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| we saw high-qualified teachers giving direct instruction to those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| We saw relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| We saw support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| We saw caring faculty and staff that empower students to be their best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| Our alternative education students are our most at-promise students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| They deserve our greatest resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| And with Ridgedale, I can truly say they exemplify the finest quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=679)|
| 0:11:27| for alternative education in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| So it's with great honor and privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| that I would like to recognize Ridgedale Alternative School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| for being a recipient of the 2019 Alternative Education Recognition Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| Ms. Gossett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=707)|
| 0:12:17| Ms. Gossett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=737)|
| 0:12:47| Ms. Gossett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=767)|
| 0:13:18| Pat, thank you very much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| I know you had to drive all the way from Nashville to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| I'd just like the opportunity to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| First of all, Ridgedale is a very special place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| and we serve children from every single district in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| We are in Mr. Norman's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| but there isn't a district that is not represented at our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| And so I want to put out a challenge to all of the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| If you have not visited our school, please do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| There are incredible teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| There are incredible teaching assistants who do work with the kids that have been suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=845)|
| 0:14:13| They do work with the kids that have behaviors that really need small, structured, safe environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=853)|
| 0:14:22| And that's what our school provides for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| So please, over the next year or so, take a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| and come spend some time in the classrooms at Ridgedale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| You'll see that there are great teachers all over Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| but there are great teachers at Ridgedale Alternative Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=883)|
| 0:14:53| Okay, moving right along, we're going to have our bus driver recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| and at this time I'll turn the program over to Ms. Severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=897)|
| 0:15:07| Thank you, Madam Chair, and I'm going to ask Ryan Dillingham, the Director of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| to go ahead with the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you, Ms. Severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Madam Chair, esteemed members of the board, Mr. Superintendent, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| There's a common thread that unites all of us in this room tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| We share a bedrock belief in the transformative power of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| We just watched a wonderful three-minute video about the power of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| Couldn't have struck more home if they tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| It is our duty to best equip our children to meet and overcome the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| that life's journey puts in their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| a duty that all members of Knox County Schools take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| The loftiest goals and most high-minded intentions mean little, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| if students cannot access them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Transportation can be a limiting factor to many of our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| particularly for the underserved in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| School bus drivers provide the means for many to access their inalienable right to an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| In this way, bus drivers are the gatekeepers to our best intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| Andy White of Ted Russell, Ford, Lincoln, and Isuzu made this award possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| He can't be with us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| He's hoping to be able to join us a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| But I would still like to extend my heartfelt thanks to him and his organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| for their ongoing dedication to student transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| It is through Mr. White's generous contributions that we're able to continue our efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| to recognize the good works done by student transportation professionals in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| At this time, well, I'm going to skip that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| We received 165 separate nominations for Bus Driver of the Year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| from school staff, student riders, parents, and other bus drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| The six people we're going to recognize this evening were chosen because of the outstanding service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| they provide to the students of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| For them, driving a bus is not a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| It's a calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| It is my honor to stand before you this evening and pay tribute to them for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| I'm going to call a driver's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| And when I call your name, if you'd be so kind as to come up to the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| the board chair and the superintendent are going to present you a plaque and a certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1041)|
| 0:17:32| And if you would please stay up at the front, we'll get a picture with everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| and then take a group shot at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| First up, because I'm doing things alphabetically, Don Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1067)|
| 0:18:00| Don drives bus 192 for McMahon Buses, Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| He's been driving for 18 years and currently serves special needs students at Christenbury Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| and Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1089)|
| 0:18:32| Hey, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| You're not off the hook quite yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| The word that comes to mind when thinking of Don is willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| He's willing to accept extra work on himself to spare it on others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| He's willing to help in whatever capacity is asked of him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| willing to take whatever steps are necessary to provide the safest environment for the kid on his bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| In the words of a staff member that has the privilege of working with him regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Mr. Don builds relationships with his parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| and makes every student feel like they are the most important child in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| He's always a bus driver we can count on for anything, and he is a role model for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| There could never be enough words to express how grateful we are for Mr. Don| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| and how long he has served our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1158)|
| 0:19:27| Next, I'd like to bring David Bowling up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1167)|
| 0:19:56| Dave drives bus 9129 for Darlene Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| He's been driving for 29 years and currently serves the students of Pond Gap Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| West Hills Elementary, and Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| David is a concerned and conscientious bus driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| He is unfailingly professional and goes out of his way to look out for those on his bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| even taking the time to explain why he is late on the rare occasions he is behind schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| A few months ago, a parent who usually meets her child at the bus stop was not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| In her words, David kept her daughter calm and got her safely back to the school where I picked her up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| She said that she was not scared at all because he remained calm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| and reassured her that everything was going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| David took charge of an unusual situation and managed it perfectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| all while keeping his focus where it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| on making sure a little girl knew she was going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1240)|
| 0:20:52| Next up is Peggy Claiborne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1252)|
| 0:21:22| Peggy is one of our bus contractors, in addition to being a bus driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| She's been driving for 36 years and currently drives bus 82,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| serving Cedar Bluff Elementary School and Cedar Bluff Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| This may sound a little counterintuitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| but sometimes talking about Peggy is more about what does not happen than what does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| What does not happen is that we do not have mechanical problems with her fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| We do not have buses with no brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| We do not have mechanical problems with her fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| We do not have buses with no drivers to drive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| We do not have issues with bus stops not being made and students not getting to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| We do not have friction with school staff, parents, or other bus drivers or bus contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| What we do have is a concerned and involved woman who maintains the highest standards for her business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| We have a bus driver who goes out of her way to look after the students in her care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| and to make sure that they get to and from school safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| And we do have a person enmeshed in her community who is universally loved and lauded by those she serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| Next I'd like to ask Amy Johnson to come up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1344)|
| 0:22:54| Amy drives bus 127 for DJK Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1374)|

| 0:23:10| While reading through the nominations for this award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| the majority of the votes that Amy received came from the students that ride her bus and their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| It carries a lot of weight with me personally if you can get buy-in from the families that you serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| And that is just what Amy has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Overwhelmingly, they noted her smiles when kids are boarding morning and afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| her engagement with the community she serves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| and that she knows the name of every single student that rides with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| She also inspires a feeling of safety in those she is transporting and those waiting for them at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| One mother relayed a story about her son, who is on the autism spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| who wanted to ride Miss Amy's bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| She was initially worried when he wanted to be a bus rider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| concerned about the actions of other students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| But Amy creates such a welcoming environment on the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| that now they are overjoyed her son gets to spend time with her each afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1439)|
| 0:24:12| Next, I'd like to invite up Miss Susan Suddrath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1452)|

| 0:24:54| Susan has acquired something of a reputation around Knox County for her baking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| I've gotten multiple reports about her bringing sweets into her schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| to help with a fundraiser, as a thank you, or sometimes just because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| I want to be perfectly clear at this point that the selection committee was not bribed in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| with treats to pick Susan, although I have had a piece of one of her cakes before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| and it was absolutely divine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| These desserts are a physical expression of the love she feels for those around her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| Earlier this year, when heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding throughout Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| Susan checked with each student as they got on the bus from the STEM Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| to make sure that she could get to their stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| Two students normally got off at a corner that was underwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Susan worked with administrators, the students, and their parents via phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| to identify a place where they could meet so the students could get home safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| In the words of Becky Ash, principal at STEM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Miss Sudrath truly goes the extra mile as our bus driver and we are thankful for her service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| Next I would like to invite up Mr. Steve Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1569)|

| 0:27:01| I was going to talk about Steve as I've talked about these other outstanding drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| but as I was reading his nominations, I realized that the parent of one of his riders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| said everything I wanted to say better than I could, so I just decided to quote her instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| Allow me to begin by saying that Mr. Walker has become family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| He displays care, gentleness, respect, and ensures that each child is safely buckled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| before he ever drives off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| My son is really connected with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| Who knew that a kid who never talked now greets this amazing man every morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| It brings me to tears to write this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| He has never been unprofessional, not once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| When late, he acknowledges and gives exact time frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| My children love Mr. Walker, and he is a very dear, special part of their day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1662)|

| 0:27:51| We are honored that he is a part of our children's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| Dealing with children can be tough, but the way he cares for our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| makes a bus ride more than just a ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| Mr. White has been able to join us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| Andy, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1683)|

| 0:31:01| the appreciation that we owe them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1861)|

| 0:31:50| and I had the privilege of serving as the board representative on the selection committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=1910)|

| 0:33:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2025)|
| 0:34:16| And just to give you a little taste of kind of what these students are, the process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2056)|
| 0:34:31| very rigorous, and again, as former chairs know, it is a tough, tough process to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2071)|
| 0:34:41| The kind of person that we picked today, when I called to let him know that he'd been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2081)|
| 0:34:50| selected, he wasn't home at the time because he was trying out for drum major at the high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| And then, when I finally did get him, his first words were, well, Ms. Hill, I can come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2097)|

| 0:35:08| that I have to study for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| So, that right there just speaks to the caliber of students that we have in this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| So, again, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2120)|

| 0:37:21| Vivian Scheip, Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| I come before you today with a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| For some of you, it has been a year since you were elected to serve the citizens of Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| For some of you, it's your second term, a term that began as every one of you stood right here in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| center of this floor, surrounded by your loved ones and your friends, with a crowd of witnesses in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| audience, watching on TV and social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| You raised your hand, you were sworn in, and you signed your name to an oath that ended with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2276)|
| 0:38:04| so help me God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| That oath begins with your acceptance of the high honor and the trust that has been placed in you by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2287)|
| 0:38:17| citizens of Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| You, who we elected to serve in the best interest of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| You, who we believed in when we went into that voting booth and used our most sacred right, the right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2306)|
| 0:38:36| And we pushed the button for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| We believed that you would, as you solemnly swore, you would faithfully execute the duties of the office to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| which you were elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| The seat of leadership is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| However, you must not respond to your position of authority with hatred, with fear, or with retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2333)|
| 0:39:05| For you serve in a nation that has a democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| We are not a third world country where our voices are controlled by the very leaders we placed in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| We built this country on a freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Our rights in the United States of America and our rights in Knotts County and Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| You, the members of the Knotts County Board of Education, have a responsibility to listen to the people whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2375)|
| 0:39:44| children have been placed in your charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| This is a dangerous moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| This is a defining moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| And so I come today to bring you a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| Leave public forum alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| Do not do this thing that you're about to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| For if you do, you will surely find out, as those who were not reelected to those very seats in which you seat, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2408)|
| 0:40:18| citizens of Knox County will not forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| And they will fill that seat with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| And the very God before whom you swore and took that solemn oath shall surely have you answer for it when you come before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2425)|
| 0:40:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2439)|
| 0:40:50| Madam Chair and board members, thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| I have here in front of me, my name is Carl Wheeler, and I'm a resident of Knox County and have been for 30 plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2456)|
| 0:41:06| Just a side note, both of my kids graduated from Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| So I'm pleased with how their lives turned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Both of them are working and contributing to members of our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| So those things that we heard earlier relative to the teachers and the drivers and things, they get my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2478)|
| 0:41:27| But when we look at this operations policy here, B180, I have the earlier version here in front of me and I have the proposed changes in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2487)|
| 0:41:41| And as Ms. Sipes said a minute ago, you don't need to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| What you have is working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| And what you have allows folks like myself and others to come before you and speak on things that we are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2511)|
| 0:42:01| And I think it's our as a citizen to bring issues to you all relative to the topic at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2521)|
| 0:42:10| So I encourage you not to reduce the time of speaking, to not go through this signing on, filling out forms, submitting paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2530)|
| 0:42:23| That creates additional work for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| Somebody in your staff has got to keep track of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| And remember, the goal here is to take and understand the public concerned about various issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2550)|
| 0:42:39| As I said a minute ago, the program as you have it right now, as far as I'm concerned, it should stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| It gets the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| You know who's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Sometimes we have individuals that may get a little bit out of hand, but the chairperson has the regal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| She can take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| So I encourage you to leave the plan that is B180 as it currently stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Constance Evry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| I think it's no secret that we can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| My name is Constance Evry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| I live in Knoxville, Tennessee, 301 North Chicago Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| It's no secret that's part of the reason why we have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Every time I come to this mic, someone interrupts me, every time, no matter what platform it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| It's always someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| This is a prime example of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| It's, to me, no secret that this bill is very possibly written just for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| Clearly, someone's really mad at me up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| I'm sure there's a lot of reasons to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Because I'm unapologetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| I do speak on behalf of my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| I do have nieces and nephews that attend schools in Knox County School District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| I do work with children that go to these same schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| I do listen to these children and these parents when they tell me the concerns and issues and matters that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| I do listen when they tell me that they've been here themselves numerous times talking to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| talking to other entities of our local government, going to the police departments, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| with their complaints and other necessities, yet they are never heard, unaddressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| and even not even possibly even considered by some of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| And as Ms. Vivian has pointed out, you took an oath, an oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| I am a disabled combat veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| I fought for this country in Afghanistan with several other soldiers and several other entities of our military forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| When we went out there, I never once said, oh, I'm just going to fight just for Knoxville or just for Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| or just for the black people or just for the poor people or just for certain demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| When I went overseas, I fought for the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| I supported my Constitution, my Bill of Rights, and our amended rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| And the biggest one of what we're challenging today is our amendment of the first one, freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| That's what this bill is trying to suppress, freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| This is a public entity job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| You are voted here, like Ms. Vivian said, by trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| We trust you to do your job here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| And then when we are displeased, it's almost like an insult and even a slap in the face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| especially for a veteran, to say, well, we don't like what you've got to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| so we're going to figure out a way to suppress your voice here by saying we're going to make up new rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| because why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| We're a de facto government anyways, ran by a charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| so it gives you a lot of room to do a lot of things that really honestly wouldn't be probably approved across this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| Look at this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Could you take this to the Supreme Court and actually win with this type of bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| if we really brought a Thurgood Marshall-style type lawyer to challenge it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Would it really uphold in such entities of our law and our government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Would you really get that type of support from your judicial comrades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| And if the question comes to that answer of a no, then what are you doing at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| Why do you not want to hear your public's voice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Why do you not want the feedback of those who vote you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Why would you not want to know the concerns and matters of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| and especially dealing with what our precious, most valuable entity to us all is our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| How many of you all have children that go to this school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| If you do, then how could you sit there as a parent with a kid in a school and tell your own kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| I don't want to hear your voice at my job because I'm not worried about your concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| It's an insult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| That's really what it comes down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| And I'm like Ms. Vivian, if you can't get the job done, that means you don't belong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| And she's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| We won't forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| We won't forget a single person or a single name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Like she says, some of you all are up for re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| Some of you all have a little bit of a marathon left to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| But at the end of the day, no one will forget who was here when this took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| And you better believe people like me especially who are talking to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| I will always inform them this person don't belong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| We are not voting for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Therefore, they do not get our checkmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| I don't care what promises you make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I don't care how much you make it sound good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| You can't get my vote because when you had your office and you had your opportunity of term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| we go look at that, the track record of fact, not what you promised me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| So I find it really disturbing that we even have such a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| And like I said before, as a veteran of this country, it gets no more insulting than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| You know, I'm going to leave on this note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| I hate when people tell me thank you for your service because my question is what are you thanking me for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| I live in a country where if I'm not in uniform and I go to a traffic stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| I could lose my life because of stereotypes and stipulations that are placed behind people like me or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| I sit here and watch my country mistreat each other day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| I watch people lie, lie day in and day out under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| But you thank me for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| No, don't thank me for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| That's not what I stood for ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Not once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Amelia Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2869)|
| 0:47:59| Hi, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| My name is Amelia Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| I wanted to speak about public forum tonight and raise three issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| Some of what has already been said tonight I completely agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| But the first point that I wanted to bring up is the way I see public forum is, sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2900)|
| 0:48:32| it should be a space where our rights as citizens are recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| But more than anything, it's to build good relationships with those in your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| and provide space to resolve conflict and find solutions together in a community setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2925)|
| 0:48:55| So whether it's the school board or whether it's other local legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| I feel it's really important for our elected representatives to model behavior back to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2942)|
| 0:49:10| of how to resolve conflict, especially in a city experiencing so much violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2950)|
| 0:49:19| especially in a school system that's experiencing, unfortunately, push out and still disparities when it comes to discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2959)|
| 0:49:30| There's so much that we can learn about how to work together, how to listen to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| You know, in this moment, I just have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| And because I'm given that opportunity, it's enough, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| I can come and spend my time and express in whatever way that I want to, to some degree, what my feelings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2985)|
| 0:49:56| And that allows me to release some, you know, stress and feel like I've been hurt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| even if you all don't do exactly what I asked you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| This is a space for us to resolve that conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| My concern is that when not only the limitation but the appearance of the limitation will only create increased conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3008)|
| 0:50:21| and you'll have people showing up at school board meetings who don't feel like their voice can be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| and so they just want to disrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| And we haven't had that at school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| I've been a part of a lot of vocal groups who have come to these meetings, but we respect the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| And we want to hear from our neighbors, and we want to get to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| And I think that that should continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| The other issue I wanted to bring up was accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| This morning, I bailed a mother out of jail in our Knox County jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| And after we left the jail, first place we went was Target and got her a cell phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| so that she could be connected to the world in some sort of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| When I dropped her off at home, she is a mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| She doesn't have Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| She just has a flip phone now with a certain number of minutes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| So when we think about accessibility, I think it's good to add options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3079)|
| 0:51:26| I would enjoy, you know, signing up online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Usually, and I think pretty much every time, I've always signed up on the day of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| because I don't know when my schedule is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| And, which is my third point, the information coming from the administration to the board, it comes so late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3099)|
| 0:51:49| Even today's agenda item, I have three different versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| I don't know which version is the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| I just got a new one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| So there was a point when I thought, no, I don't need to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| But as I still had questions and concerns, it was today that I decided to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| Similarly with the budget, I think we got the budget like the day before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| So that's, you know, not only am I a community leader who wants to come and share my thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| but usually I'm one of those trying to spread the word and let other folks know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| And I'm letting folks know who may get off work at 5 o'clock and they can't get here at 4.55 to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3150)|
| 0:52:39| That's a privileged position to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| So I just want you all to keep in mind the issue of accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| who has the privileges to be able to meet this new potential criteria if there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| and what's really going to maintain a good relationship with the community and a productive meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3176)|
| 0:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3189)|
| 0:53:16| Yes, my name is David Hayes, proud resident of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| I'm speaking on, of course, this public forum debate, and I stand in solidarity with everybody who came before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| I think everybody brought up some excellent points that all you all should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| Just to add some more to what's been said is that a crucial part of democracy is participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3213)|
| 0:53:41| people in the community having a chance to participate in the political process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| Some of you up here might believe that since you got voted, that's enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| and that people shouldn't have another say in what goes on in their lives, in their schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| in their school board, in the county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| That's false, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| We actually want a democracy where everybody's engaged, people to have multiple ways to engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| So what you all are doing is, at its core, undemocratic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| At its core, against so many of the values and principles that people in this room and this country say we're for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| You know, it cuts deep when you say we don't want to hear your voice anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| We want to legislate, we want to control your lives, but make it harder for you to say anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| When you ask the questions of why would you all want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| why would you not want people to come up here and speak, it begs the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| is it because of the ridiculously high class sizes in some schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| Is it because of the bullying that's going on in so many schools with so many queer kids, trans kids, gay kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| some LGBTQ plus kids being bullied at schools and not actually enough infrastructure in our schools to deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| Is it because of the racism that's running rampant in our discipline system where one out of three kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| or if you're a black student, you're three times as likely to get pushed out by arrests and suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| You know, is it because of the racism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Is it because you're underfunding magnet schools and school programs that people need to get through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| yeah, to get through school and graduate and become successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| Because there's a lot, there's lots of issues going on in the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| and I've seen, I remember, what was it, last year, when folks were defending Project Grad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| and defending the magnet schools and, you know, folks came out here in the hundreds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| And I imagine that when you come to the decision to limit public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| that event must have been also on your mind as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| And it's troubling that that event and others where people come and speak to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| actually has the effect of not opening your heart to want to listen more to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| It has the effect of saying, oh, snap, we need to restrict this democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| We need to restrict the voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| That's very troubling, and we shouldn't see that in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| I would ask for you all to have some empathy with people who have kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| with people who are affected by our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| and I ask for you all to, instead of trying to limit ways for people to give their voices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| that you actually go out of your way to open your hands, open your ears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| and open the process so more people can have a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| And not just through the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| but also through most of the decisions you make is actually not very democratic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| You know, the budget system as it is doesn't have nearly as much community engagement as it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| People shouldn't have to raise some of the stink they've been raising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| There should be a way for people to participate in developing the priorities and the goals of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3392)|
| 0:56:40| And, you know, that's a longer way off plan, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| cutting and restricting public forum is doing nothing to that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| Yeah, and that's everything I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| I also want to say, like, I'm running for office soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| and I think something that's important for me is to realize that I am not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| my goal for getting into office is not necessarily for me to control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| and just do things in government that affect other people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| It's to actually listen to people, have people participate in the political process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| and for me to be a vehicle for that community voice, for that community voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| for that power to be transferred and things to get done based on what people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| not inherently just on what me and myself and what my friends want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| It's about having people's participation and people's voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| And all of you are elected here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| I hope you all have a shared value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Obviously not if you decide to vote against this or for restricting public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| And thank you all for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| That concludes public forum on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Do I hear a motion to approve first reading policy B180?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3462)|
| 0:58:00| Ms. Coates just pointed out that there are two versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| The one we are looking at, I believe, is the one just handed to us by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3487)|
| 0:58:16| Has this been, and this is out, public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| I do appreciate our speakers that came to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| Could we have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| I'd like to make a motion to refer this back to committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| We have a motion and a second to refer this back to policy review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Yes, I'd like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| I appreciate these comments that you all have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| And you brought up several good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| I'm certainly one of the ones that probably spoke out in the most restrictive ways about public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| And, indeed, I'm reconsidering some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| So I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| And I do agree with a lot of your points that you've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| So I appreciate you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| I would just like to say I appreciate the speakers also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| And, you know, I'm actually glad we're taking this back to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| I will say, because I know a lot of people talk about the time limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| but I have been someone that does support limiting it down to four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| And I'm just going to explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| I, last year, was not on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| And I sat through the project grad meeting of all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| And it was powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| I was very moved by all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| And I love the fact that we got to hear from all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| But with five minutes and when we give everyone the opportunity, which I think is what we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| I've seen a couple of people tonight that made excellent points, got their point across in about three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| And so I think we're trying to figure out how can we make it manageable so that we're actually not dozing off at 1 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3606)|
| 1:00:17| Because we want to be able to get as many people as possible to listen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| We want to be able to hear your voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| So that is why I do support the four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| I feel like it's plenty of time for people to get their point across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| It's not in any way to limit anyone speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| But so I'm glad we're going back to policy review about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| But I just wanted to kind of get across my thoughts on why I think the four minutes is a good change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3638)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| I agree with Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| I don't think the intention of looking at this policy has ever been to limit public speech because it just hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3650)|
| 1:01:00| And since we've been talking about this, I've been paying attention to how long public forum speakers speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| And typically it's around three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| Sometimes it goes to four, sometimes to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| But I support the four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| I think that, you know, if you think about having hours upon hours upon hours, which is rare, that we would have that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3675)|
| 1:01:24| But when we do, by the time you're the 90th person, I want to be able to pay attention to that person as well as I have the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3684)|
| 1:01:34| But it gets a little more challenging the later in the evening it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| So hopefully if people have that four minutes, we would be able to get more speakers in in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3697)|
| 1:01:46| Regarding the registration, we want to make sure that our board secretary has the ability to provide information to us during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3706)|
| 1:01:59| during a day that we have a meeting in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| And a lot of times she can get tied up with public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| So it's really simply about making sure that she has the ability to provide information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| If staff is giving information to us or whatever is happening, that she has the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| And so that's why we talked about making it the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| I was going to suggest that we look at maybe 11.59 p.m. the day prior to the meeting so that you would have the whole evening prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3746)|
| 1:02:36| So the intent is not to make it more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| I also am in favor of allowing people to sign up at the beginning of our meeting before that meeting starts in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3758)|
| 1:02:46| So I don't think the intention is at all in my mind to limit public forum or people's freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3766)|
| 1:02:54| It's simply to make sure that we're running an efficient meeting and making sure that we're protecting our secretary's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3774)|
| 1:03:03| so that we have the information we need to make sure that our meetings are effective since this is our meeting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| I think there are several inherent problems with public forum that create the difficulty in making policy around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3797)|
| 1:03:28| The fact that there's no discussion is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| There's no opportunity for us to respond to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| There's no way for us to answer questions when there are questions brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| There's no way for speakers to get accurate information while they're speaking if they've been given inaccurate information prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3822)|
| 1:03:51| And uniquely problematic to this body is that it is normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| It is regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| It's not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| We usually have young students in our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| And so that also makes the issue of restraint sort of more important, I think, than in other government bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3842)|
| 1:04:14| A speaker should be able to come and speak without being limited because so many speakers going before them have used so much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3854)|
| 1:04:25| We have had meetings recently where just public forum, had they all taken five minutes, would have been more than seven hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3865)|
| 1:04:34| And if you put that on top of a two- or three-hour meeting, that's an extremely long time for a person with young children to sit and wait for their turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3874)|
| 1:04:43| So it's important to hear from everyone, not necessarily to hear from a few for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3883)|
| 1:04:52| I think our current practice also only allows signing up on the day of for the five minutes before meeting starts, and that's extremely short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3892)|
| 1:05:03| It's also currently in policy worded very vaguely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| Even though practice has been five minutes, I think it just says before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| So there's no absolute time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| I think that could be very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| And when we're looking at this, I think we have an issue with our agenda being perceived by the community as something the board is doing to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3917)|
| 1:05:33| rather than something the board has chosen to discuss or something someone has asked the board to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3933)|
| 1:05:42| It's not necessarily something the board is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| It's just something that is being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| And I think that we need to do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| I'm not sure how, but a better job of being clear with the community that just because it's on the agenda doesn't mean that it's something that we are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3953)|
| 1:06:01| It is just something that is being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| And an example I would give to a piece of misinformation is that our intent was to limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3965)|
| 1:06:14| Because one of the items that's in the revision was an additional way to sign up, an additional way to get the information that the community needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3974)|
| 1:06:24| But the community is not aware of that because they weren't able to hear our discussion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3984)|
| 1:06:32| And so all of these problems with public forum, I'm not sure how we need to address them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| but they are all certainly inherent problems to the way we're doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Ms. Bowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| And some of the points have already been made, but I do appreciate all the public forum speakers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| And I, too, do not feel like this policy is to eliminate anyone's ability to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| In fact, I think Ms. Parker said it best when she said we've added options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| We haven't taken any away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| You can still call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| We just tried to streamline it and move it to the 21st century as far as giving online options as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| hoping that that would help Ms. Coatney to be able to focus on what I continue to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| that it's hard to get those revisions and you get them late on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| But she has a very big task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| And when she's answering phone calls and signing up, which is rare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| a hundred people to speak at public forum and having a conversation with each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| it does take up a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| And so we would like to make the process more efficient so that hopefully those things can be on the agenda earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4061)|
| 1:07:49| and the public would be more aware of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| And in our policy review discussion, I believe that we discussed three minutes, five minutes, four minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4073)|
| 1:08:01| and four minutes was actually a compromise based on the data that I believe Ms. Owens had collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| from the meetings of the average public speaker and how long they spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4088)|
| 1:08:15| And that showed, the data that she had collected showed that the average public forum speaker spoke for four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| So four minutes was actually a compromise on the board's part in the policy review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| not to take it away, but just to take off one minute, hoping that that would allow for more people to be able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4110)|
| 1:08:39| So I'm glad this is going back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Hopefully we'll come back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| And I appreciate so much Ms. Owens' comments that we need to work together collaboratively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4125)|
| 1:08:53| and this is not about the board trying to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| And sometimes this is the only format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| We have to discuss it with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| We don't have the privilege that the state legislature has of behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| Everything we do is out here in front of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| So anyway, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| I'm not going to add, I mean, say the same things again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| I agree with pretty much what everybody up here said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| But I will add that I'm a little frustrated with our policy review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4165)|
| 1:09:32| You know, Mr. Thomas and his staff have listened to us talk about public forum how many times now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| And I think that there are probably much better uses of their time than hearing us discuss the same policies over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4178)|
| 1:09:48| So when this goes back to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| if maybe we can also discuss how we're going to review policies in the future, that would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4191)|
| 1:10:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| I'll just point out that we are required to review every policy at least every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| So we do have to go through every policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4213)|
| 1:10:23| Seeing no more lights, we have a motion and a second on the floor to send this policy B180 back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4223)|

| 1:17:57| And I'm going to continue what my son was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| When he came home and mentioned that to me, and I get it that this day and age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| things are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| Acceptance and diversity and things are going on, but when he comes home and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| asks me about what is LGBT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| I explained it to him because, you know, things are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| Beliefs are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| That community is getting more respect that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| But what got me was that when he's telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| about these things and he says, dad, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| He was hearing that during the Tuskegee Airmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| And in the four minutes that I got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| I'm going to explain some things that I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| want the board to hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| And a lot of you might get it, understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| I know one will get it just because of the ethnic makeup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| of the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4730)|
| 1:18:50| It's just some things that I want to share with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| that I think that you guys need to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Now, I might say some things that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| might get offended about, might get their feelings hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| But I believe that being a black American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| there's things that I can say concerning diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| that maybe my counterparts might get in trouble for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| People might call them bigoted or they're being hateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| And so my thing is that as a black American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| I'm an inheritor of civil rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| That is my legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| That is something that people that have went before me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| So that way, even in this capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| I can stand up in front of all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| And so as I stand here, I'm not trying to take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| from that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| I just didn't like it that it was coincided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| with the issues, the challenges, the struggles that were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| on with the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| It's been a change in society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| And you guys have noticed it, that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4795)|

| 1:20:00| as though they are the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| But they are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| There are things that, there are struggles and accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| There's things that are distinct differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| is what I want to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| As I said, I don't like explaining that to my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| Generations before me have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| They have lived through horrible situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| and lynching and murdering and raping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| and have their businesses and churches and towns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| and things were burned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| And their blood, sweat, and tears were shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| So that those of us that could claim after them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| could have these freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| And not too long ago, if you are 65 and up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| me standing here would not be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| This is the legacy of the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| And while these evils were going on to the black community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| another community was barely skinning their knee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| because of ignorance had them in the closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| For me, I'm already out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| You can, living in West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| I could be out in a store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| And you feel like a raisin in a bunch of milk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| and somebody ate up all the bran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| Think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| I didn't have to come out to my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| My whole family is black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| We are openly black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| We are openly in an interracial relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| And these are just the things that I did not like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| combining those things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| And there was a promise that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| gave Knox County schools about four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| That when I received a letter that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| was meant to silence me with a bunch of lies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| it sort of reminded me of the walls of Jericho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| How when they marched around the walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| God had given them instructions that you march around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| until things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| So me, I've been on the outside listening, watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| sending an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| I'm sure all you got an email from me about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| That even though I'm on the outside of the walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| today I'm coming in to say, respect our legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| Respect our lineage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| Tennessee was the state that started segregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| Maybe now you can lead in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| Have the highest respect for our legacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| and ultimately have the highest respect for our parent-child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| I'm Mr. Johnson, and I approve this message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4966)|

| 1:23:17| for year two included in the five-year Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| Schools Grad Memorandum of Agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| established last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| The agreement stipulates that reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| begins in December 2019 after final information is received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| on the 2019 graduation rate and the initial post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| enrollment of that class and final grad scholarship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| award is known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| We already, however, have seen an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| in the projected number of 2019 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| on track for the grad scholarship subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| to verification of final GPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| We celebrated 125 scholars at the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| celebration last month, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5038)|

| 1:24:20| graduating with four-year degrees within four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| The completion of these 39 now means a cumulative total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| of 541 graduates from Austin East and Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5069)|

| 1:27:06| and we appreciate the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| to serve a population of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5228)|

| 1:27:52| I quite frankly believe that technology is our future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| and these policies, they discourage teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| from incorporating it into our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| One of the main reasons teachers have students use their phones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| is because of the lack of technology already at schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| While some schools have a one-to-one program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| most schools only have maybe three-to-one program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| which makes it hard for teachers to reserve certain devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| in order to be incorporated into classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| The point of school is to prepare students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| for the future rather than to prepare them for the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| And if the future is progressing towards full incorporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| of technology, whether it be for personal life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| or in professional life, then schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| need to be able to incorporate that as well to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| familiarize students with those devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| I understand there are certain concerns regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| the safety of students, but if we can figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| a way to properly educate them on safe ways to use them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| then that will certainly benefit all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| in allowing them to be able to use these devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| to their positive advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| By asking a teacher to get special administrative power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| just to use a device for one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| it's ridiculous because it discourages them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| from asking in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| So by giving the power to the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| to decide when to use them, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| allow the devices to be incorporated more often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| than they already are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| I was talking to a teacher today who can even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| get Chromebooks to use just because everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| reserved them for the final weeks of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| And if we don't have these devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| but it's still a way to incorporate devices into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| then cell phones provide that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| to use devices and overall progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| through the technological world for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| I believe that also devices connect us with the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| And by restricting them for eight hours a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| really doesn't connect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| Parents want to be able to check in with their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| And unless you want hundreds of parents calling the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| just to ask how one child's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| that's going to become even more of a distraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| than the possible distraction of someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| having a phone out in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| These devices should also be able to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| used during free periods in which we can use these devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| to better expand our knowledge of certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| that we may have discussed earlier in the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| or that we plan on discussing in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| therefore allowing us to contribute more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| Going back to concerns, the Knox School's buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| have very little reception, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| at that to use these devices, allowing most students to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| to connect to the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Through this, we're able to control and filter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| what goes in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| And I understand the concern of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| using that for bullying or even just miscellaneous things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5463)|
| 1:31:10| We're able to control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| And through that, we're able to sort of help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| and gauge them to where they need to be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| instead of away from where they shouldn't be looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| Thank you, Mr. Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| Mr. Lindsey, do you mind telling me where you go to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| I go to Hardin Valley Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| I'm attending LNN next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| Thank you for coming and speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| And Mr. Little-Johnson, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| for coming and speaking, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| We always love to hear from our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| That's much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| Seeing no lights, do I hear a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5513)|
| 1:31:53| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May08?start=5513)|
