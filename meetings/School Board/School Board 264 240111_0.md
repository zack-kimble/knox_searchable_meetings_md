| 0:01:52| Unfortunately, Mr. McMillan is absent due to illness, so keep him in your thoughts and prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| Also, Board Chair, Ms. Betsy Henderson, she will be here, but she's going to be late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| She is with her daughter, just a minor injury, but she's at East Tennessee Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| She should be here sometime during the meeting, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Thank you for coming. Thank you for your attendance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Again, just as a reminder, this is the Board's public business meeting to discuss items that come before us for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| So we ask that you be respectful and courteous at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| And then, as a reminder, Knox County Schools will be closed Monday, January 15th in celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| Dr. King's actual birth date was January 15th, 1929, so it is exciting that he will be celebrated on his actual birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| And many of you also, I think, probably received a text a little bit ago that school is closed tomorrow, so I will let Dr. Reiswick speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=158)|
| 0:02:48| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Yeah, it's been quite a weather week, so I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| Our staff has really been working hard to try to monitor just everything that's gone on this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| It's been unique, so I'll start to kind of address some of the whole week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| and then I know we just did this about 30, 45 minutes ago to kind of get the word out for tomorrow, so I'll address that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| So I just want to reiterate, first of all, safety of our students and our staff is always our number one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| We can't say that enough. It really is what we focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| The events of this week have been very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| We are very good and very versed historically with ice and snow and freezing temperatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| and even illness that we can look at three-day trends and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| Wind is hard to see, and wind is a very different factor that we've dealt with this week, and I know it kind of seems odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| So just kind of talking through some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| I know Monday night, let me start back on there and kind of take us to where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| So Monday night, we were following the National Weather Service and the things that were going on then too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| Even actually during this meeting, I had a few texts with some of our staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| to kind of where we were on that from our transportation side, also from our security side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| We felt very confident at that point. After the meeting Monday night, we monitored as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| I talked to a few other East Tennessee superintendents who also chose not to close, and we had those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| We were aware that the possibility of gusts could happen Tuesday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| When we all went to bed Monday night, what we were hearing was definitely foothills and close to the mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=256)|
| 0:04:25| were places that they were predicting that but kind of seeing what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| The other factor we had at that point was potential late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| They were saying 3 o'clock is real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| For us, it's really about dismissing and again with winds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| We weren't even talking about terrible weather or flooding and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| We were fortunate enough to have a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| So Tuesday morning, chose to go on regular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| Ninety-eight percent ridership of our buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| We have roughly 20,000 students a day who ride our buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Ninety-eight percent picked up. Things went fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| A few routes we weren't able to run, but most of them were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| We were continuing to monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| I know different media outlets are reporting different things about what did we learn new at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| We didn't learn anything new at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| What we were trying to do is monitor that window of when the gusts were going to hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| The real goal on wind is there are certain levels of gusts you don't want to hit for high-profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| It's very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| High-profile vehicles during drop-off and pick-up time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Our schools are totally fine to handle 30, 40, 50-mile-per-hour gusts when kids are in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| What we don't want to do is have buses out when those gusts get to that level because that's the safety problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| If it was between 11 and 1 o'clock during the day, we wouldn't have made any kind of call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| Our hope was, waiting for that National Weather Service report, that they were going to somehow push that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| It was talking 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock when those gusts would start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| We were fine for the whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| When we got confirmation, I think it was 11-16, when that came across for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| Ryan Dillingham and the chief who do a great job notified Dr. Adams within 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| We were in my office going through those things, verifying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| looking again one more time at the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| We moved at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| I think notified the board shortly after noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Our goal at that point was to try to get students out as fast as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| For those of you, the public, who don't see that sign, there's a lot of pieces to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| I usually let you all at the board know first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| Then we've got a sequence of letting principals know because they have to operate their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| It's also in the middle of food service, trying to make sure everyone's got their food and their lunch for the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| making sure that's all placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Then we have a ton of bus contractors who have to fire up their buses and get them there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| All that's coordinated in a short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| We did that, again, trying to get that dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| It's always hard when you do early dismissals, but we tried to get that out and get that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| Then we actually did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| We didn't know at the time, but we were experiencing somewhat of a glitch in our communication program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| So it was slow to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Still wasn't a lot of time, so I'm not blaming that, going, oh, that was our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| We still had a window of about 45 minutes to an hour to get all this messaging out to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| We made the choice to do that soon to get folks and get buses off the roads at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| That night, we made the call for the two-hour delay, and, again, we were monitoring to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| We got our team on a call at 830 and had our security team in conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| We don't just watch the news, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| So we're calling the National Weather Service, talking to their meteorologist in Morristown as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| and we wanted the hour-by-hour breakdown again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| So it's very different if wind gusts could be at 50, but they're done by 4 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| So for us, we wanted confirmation at the latest hour as possible that they thought these wind gusts could proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Our buses hit about 6 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| So we wanted to make sure that we were all clear by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| We were getting reports 4 in the morning, big gusts will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| 6 o'clock, they'll be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| We got that confirmation at 830 in the phone call we made that it would be 8 o'clock a.m. before they felt like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| Well, that gives us about a two-hour delay to make sure those gusts have moved at that point and to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| So really, again, roads weren't a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Downed trees weren't a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| We weren't seeing a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| So that was the reason for our two-hour delay on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| Looking forward to tomorrow, again, this is all wind, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| We're not looking at other things like, yeah, hazardous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| We started getting reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| And sometimes weather's hard to predict in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| I give it to all the meteorologists out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| It's always, are we going to get snow? Are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| Are winds going to do this? Are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| We got the 24-hour kind of cover everything, 7 a.m. to 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| It's going to be windy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| And we're like, well, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Is that in Jamestown? Is that in Sevierville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| So processing through all that stuff, we looked at those things today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| They are calling for the morning would probably be fine for us tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| We could get everybody picked up and we could get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| But we asked for the hour-by-hour breakdown from the meteorologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| They gave us surface-sustained winds and when those would be where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| And then they also gave us the gust and when those start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| And it sounds like what we had when we made the call about 4 o'clock today for tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| was around 11 o'clock is when we start hitting that again for high-profile vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| so back to our buses and 20,000 of our students that transport that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| We could get them here tomorrow, but we'd be turning back around at 11 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| to send them home in hopes that we could get them off the road before the gust hit at 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| So I want to say this, totally understand, as a dad myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| that that is extremely inconvenient for families to do early dismissals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| It's always tough on work schedules to do late starts and the call days off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| But, you know, wind is kind of a new creature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| We haven't had a lot of that to deal with, but I applaud, again, our transportation team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| and our security team for, you know, monitoring that with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| you know, looking through those things and trying to notify families as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| and trying to be, you know, good stewards of the days that we have because we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| I mean, I know we're looking at weather already for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| We're monitoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| You know, we've seen that change, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| When we were looking at it three days ago, they were saying 1 to 2 degrees in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| Now it's up to 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| So, you know, it's hard to predict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| I don't want to be a meteorologist, but we're trying to do that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| and in the meantime keep 60,000 students safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| and trying to be cognizant of families and what they do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| So I wanted to explain some of that because I know there's been some different kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| that have been out there for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| But I do think in the end, you know, we're blessed our kids all got home safely through all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| and we appreciate the patience from families and us trying to keep everybody safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=623)|
| 0:10:35| Sorry I was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| My daughter was in the hospital, so we just came from the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| So thank you, Mr. Triplett, for starting the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| Thank you, Dr. Weiswick, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| Board members, there were some changes to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| As discussed at our work session on Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| a proposed revision was made to board policy J580,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| which is the student suicide prevention policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| It's being considered as item 7U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| And thank you, Celeste, for bringing that to our attention and for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| The revision clarifies where available resources will be posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| So a version 2 of that policy is attached to the agenda for your consideration on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| So again, thank you, Celeste, for bringing that to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| and being such a great student representative to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Additionally, at the work session, we were asked to communicate ideas or suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| we had regarding our 2024 legislative priorities to Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| She took all of the communications received and compiled a draft document for our consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| The document is attached to the agenda, and you also have a paper copy at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| Consideration of the priorities is agenda item 10E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| so I will entertain further discussion or motions when that item is read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| Are there any other requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| Motion by Ms. Horne, second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=722)|

| 0:12:08| Next, we have special recognition of leading innovators of instructional technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| We have Ms. Amber Moser of Learning and Development Supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| Is she in the audience tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Hello. Welcome. Welcome. We're excited to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=742)|

| 0:12:34| It's an honor to be here tonight to recognize Knox County Schools' second cohort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| of leading innovators of instructional technology, also known as the LITE group. That's L-I-I-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| In joining this cohort, interested staff members went through an application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| The members of this group were selected because they exemplified initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| sound pedagogy, content knowledge, a growth mindset, and vulnerability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| They committed to engaging growth and leadership that impacts student success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| and to share and model best practices using technology to maximize teaching and learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| at their schools and across our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| This group spent the 2023 calendar year, January to December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| learning and networking with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| The main goals of the LITE group are to gain a deeper understanding of effectively using educational technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| and how to share that understanding with other professionals in service of, ultimately, impacting our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=808)|
| 0:13:36| In addition to their efforts within the cohort meeting structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| members of the LITE 23 cohort have been able to support our district by presenting at District Learning Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| promoting tools at our summer EdTech mini-conference professional learning event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| sharing learning with their school-based colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| and through providing feedback on various procedures related to educational technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| When members of the cohort were asked to reflect on their experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| one member made the following statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| I gained confidence in leadership and feel as though I have valuable information to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| I was also introduced to different perspectives and tech tools that have informed my practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| I believe the individual and collective growth displayed by the LITE 2023 group will complement our district's four priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| And at this time, I would like to recognize the members of the LITE 2023 cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| We have several who were unable to attend tonight, so I will announce their names at the end of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=870)|

| 0:16:20| Thank you so much for taking the time to recognize these educators tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=980)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=992)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1022)|

| 0:17:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1052)|

| 0:17:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| I just want to remind the public that the board has had a detailed discussion on this agenda at our work session this past Monday, January the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1079)|
| 0:18:07| So with that, Miss Coatney, why don't we go ahead and get into the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Item 6, Consent Agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| Motion by Miss Horne, a second by Miss Christie. Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| Seeing there's no discussion, all those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Item 7A, Approved First Reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy I-241, School Libraries, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1109)|
| 0:18:38| Motion by Miss Owen, a second by Reverend Butler. Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| I know I didn't bring this up the other night on Monday, but I know we had quite a bit of discussion about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| and I think it would be good just to let the public know why we're making this switch from the standards of the American Library Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| to the American Association of School Librarians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| From what I remember from the conversation, it's because the American Library Association has set standards for all libraries of all types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| and we felt like it would be important to really solidify that and look to the association that's really about school libraries specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| If I'm wrong about that, please correct me, but I thought that was important to make note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Is that correct? Is that what was driving that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Thank you. Yes, that is correct, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| The way you characterized it, that larger entity, the American Library Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| they set standards for a medical school library, a law school library, all kinds of different research and data centers, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1172)|
| 0:19:40| I think another point to make there, too, is, and to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| we would probably go back and look for guidance more from the American Association of School Libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| and even in that, we are not necessarily adhering to or a member of any type of association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| but we do lean back into them at times for professional learning and for guidance and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| If I recall correctly, I think one of those is under the other, so it's really one big entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Ms. Owen actually made that motion to approve and that was seconded by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| Oh, by Dr. Butler. Sorry, I'm a little off tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1228)|

| 0:21:05| And we do have some public forum speakers on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| We can go to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1269)|

| 0:21:11| We do have three public forum speakers on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| We do have three public forum speakers on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Megan, I'm going to have you come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| I apologize for not pronouncing your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| I am sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| That's a long one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| Megan, if you'll state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| and then you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| My name is Megan Hazelsworth, Knox County resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| mom to two future KCS students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| and I'm an associate professor in child and family studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| No one understands the desire to get policy, language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| and alignment quite like an academic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| I understand the seemingly logical decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| to strike actual or perceived gender and sexual orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| from the list and replace it with sex to align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| with some of the upstream policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| I recognize that the harassment of students policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| affirmatively states that KCS schools do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| tolerate harassment for any reason, which, at least in policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| includes gender identity and sexual orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| But I think it's important to consider our country's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| sociopolitical and historical backdrop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| is particularly vital to consider when deciding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| to strike gender identity and sexual orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| from the truncated list, replacing it with sex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| 510 anti-LGBT bills were introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| and 84 bills were passed in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Ten of those were in Tennessee, were leading the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| in anti-LGBT legislation, particularly against youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Most of these targeted education and gender-affirming care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| When it comes to LGBT youth, politicians have decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| that science and medicine are not relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| to legislative decision-making, as every single reputable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| pediatric medicine, child development and family science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| organization, including the National Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| on Family Relations, to which I belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| stand by the overwhelming evidence of the essentiality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| of providing gender-based evidence care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| for transgender youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| It's important to also note that sex and gender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| while often conflated, are actually quite distinct concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and sexual orientation even more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| So the replacement of sex doesn't really address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| the two others that were addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| Approximately 10% of U.S. youth identify as LGBTQ+,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| including the 1.5% who identify as transgender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Despite their small numbers, peers, adults and legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| seem motivated to make these youth's lives more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| 84% of transgender youth were bullied or harassed at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| based on a recent survey from this past year of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| Suicide ideation and completed suicide rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| are exponentially higher for transgender and other LGBT youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| when compared to cisgender and gender-majority youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| Their risks of all sorts of mental and physical health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| and academic outcomes align much more closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| with their straight, heterosexual and cisgender peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| when they have supportive parents, peers, teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| and school districts that explicitly affirm them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| Transgender and gender and sexual minority youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| can and do thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| We have ample research that demonstrates this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| But the community context, particularly our policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| are essential in acknowledging their existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| their reality, and naming and boldly standing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| against anti-LGBT harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| By stripping out gender identity and sexual orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| from this policy, you would be doing the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Replacing them with sex is not the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| As elected officials, you have the unique opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| to contribute to a better school context for all youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| especially the small percentage of youth and their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| who remain under legislative attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Legislative attacks that will shorten the lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| of our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Words matter, the meaning behind them matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| what we include as exemplars in policy lists indeed matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| I urge you to stick with the current policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| and keep gender identity and sexual orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| named in J210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you, Megan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Leticia Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| If you'll state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| and you'll also have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Yes, my name is Leticia Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| I'm a straight, cisgendered psychologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| who has lived in Knoxville for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| I work to help to educate the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| about LGBTQ issues on behalf of the Tennessee Equality Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| and I work with graduate psychology students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| who provide therapy to LGBTQ youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| adults, and their family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| I'm here tonight to urge the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| to keep the language protecting LGBTQ youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| from harassment or discrimination in their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| And I will veer a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| It's not clear to many of us why they're considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| why you're considering taking away that text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| so if there is any time to kind of talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| I would appreciate hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| But it's very concerning for many of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| to hear about this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| As you heard, already over 500 bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| were lodged against LGBTQ people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| including youth, in the nation in 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| a historic high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| And we passed many of those laws here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| High numbers of mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| are being reported among all of our youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| but especially among LGBTQ youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| specifically due to bullying at schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| as well as other experiences where they feel targeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| simply for who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Some of you may have experienced bullying in school yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| and so you may remember how isolated and scared you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| when this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| This is easily one of the most vulnerable youth populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| in our city, in our state, in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| And you are seriously considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| still explicitly removing protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| for one of the most vulnerable populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| University presidents were criticized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| and some lost their jobs recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| because they hemmed and hawed about the hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| lodged against certain groups of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| hiding behind liability concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| The board's decision to not leave well enough alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| to not show simple human compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| is at risk of committing the same mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| These children are not potential lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| They are flesh and blood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| and they will feel the effects of the stroke of your pen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| in taunts and fights and worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| So, again, I'm curious about your intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| I don't know if this is extreme tone deafness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| or is it a loud and clear message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| that you are sending to these children and their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| that you do not value their safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| If it's a mistake made honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| then you still have the opportunity to reverse course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| and let LGBTQ youth and their family and friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| sleep better at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Reversing course and leaving the policy as is harms no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| No one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| If revising this bill is in fact an attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| to further marginalize and ostracize these vulnerable youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| regardless of the arguments you use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| we'll all learn a valuable lesson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| about who you are and your intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| for protecting all of the children of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| As Maya Angelou said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| when someone shows you who they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| believe them the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| So who will you be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| Allie Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| If you'll state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| and you also have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| My name is Allie Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| I'm actually a Rocky Hill community resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| in District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| I'm also the chair of the Tennessee Equality Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| here locally in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| and we focus on LGBTQ plus policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| that impact people across the state now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| I'm here to request that you choose to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| all of your students by rejecting the backward revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| of this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| By removing the terms actual or perceived gender identity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| and sexual orientation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| it sends a harmful message to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| and your educators who identify as LGBTQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| It also is an invitation to students and educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| to harass, exclude, and bully LGBTQ people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| This includes students, staff, anyone in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| After doing this for eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| I can tell you I've heard a lot of stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| I've done a lot of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| And as a leader in the community and the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I work with the current administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| at all levels in the White House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| I've shared conversations with the Department of Education's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| I can tell you that there is a wealth of evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| that unequivocally supports enumerated protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| for different classes of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| In this case, in this policy, you're LGBTQ students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| Meaning that rather than reducing a language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| in your policies to sex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| you would want to actually increase the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| in your policy to protect all of your students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| There's no reason why you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| It's a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| During the most recent work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| the law director attempted to justify the use of sex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| and remove the terms gender identity and sexual orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| in the harassment of students in the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| and read off the Federal Office of Civil Rights explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| which I thought was interesting because it included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| describing male and female LGBTQ students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| students with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| and students with different races, ethnicities, and other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| and also students of the same sex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| So while citing this makes more sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| to actually increase the language that's in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| I also reached out to two school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| in the last week and received no reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| So I reached out to one of Tennessee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| most prominent public school allies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| that we have in the Tennessee legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| and I asked her for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| And she actually submitted and I received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| a legislative analysis for this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| that I'm happy to share with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| And there was a comment on Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| that I found very interesting that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| the reasons why this change are moot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| rather than focusing on this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| more concerning should be whether district administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| enforcing any of these policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| and how their procedures impact endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| This was said by one of your own board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Someone said before, I will echo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| words matter in conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| We all know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Everyone here is an educator, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| by extension of being on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| Also matter in debate and public discourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| If you need evidence-based guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| I suggest you visit the Office of Civil Rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| the Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| and they all have resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| that you need to do right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| by your minority-identified students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Please reconsider adopting a revised policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| that appears to erase the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| of carefully protected students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| in a large group of people here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| And don't forget that success for every student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| is priority number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you, Ellie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Moving on to discussion, Ms. Vike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| I don't think I can say it better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| than our public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I had planned to say something to similar effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| I understand the justifications for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| I understand that before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| what we're proposing to take out says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| for any reason including but not limited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| but I do think that now is not the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| to make this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| so I don't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| Thank you, Ms. Vike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| I'm sure we've all spent significant time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| talking to people about this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| and the proposed language change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| I support a policy that is clear and concise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| while also being broad enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| to cover everything that it needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| And over time, a lot of our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| have become bloated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| This particular policy has actually grown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| both better and worse over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| There was a time when our harassment policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| covered only sexual harassment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| so if a student or staff member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| were harassed for any other reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| or any unknown reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| there was absolutely nothing to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| And it was a very long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| but also during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| if a person were reporting it over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| that person would end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| seeing some disciplinary action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| rather than the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| So I think that over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| we have made this policy much stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| However, I don't always see it being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| truly looked into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| when things come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| I think it's a lot easier to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| well, there's no proof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| than to really, really look for that proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| And I think that's something that we as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| need to hold everyone accountable for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| I believe that this language change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| meets the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| that I usually feel good about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| for being concise and clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| and also being broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| I also feel like it's legally appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| and on Monday, I would have voted in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Since then, it's become very clear to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| that this issue isn't just divisive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| it's a lot worse than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Regardless of our intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| there are a lot of people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| who see this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| as this board adopting a philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| that we've never even talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| And that's concerning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| because we're not going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| to convince them otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| I've already been contacted by a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| who used very specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| disparaging, concerning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| and frankly disgusting language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| regarding our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| The person made it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| that the revised language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| made her feel very empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| to say those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| and to sign her name to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| And therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| even though we feel like this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| is legally appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| and provides the appropriate legal protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| if this language change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| makes people feel empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| to treat our kids that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| that's something that there's no way I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I know we discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| at the last policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Do you want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| I know your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Since Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| when this was discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| I've heard from both sides of the aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| And frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| what I've heard is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| sociopolitical arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| about the merits of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| and the demerits of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| and again, I've heard from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| The suggestion, the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| was made purely for legal purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| As I indicated Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| LGBTQ individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| are protected under the harassment law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| have been for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| and it's gotten even better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| for those individuals recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| There have been court cases come out since 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| And as late as last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| that have strengthened those principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| So, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| as Ms. Owen indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| I mean, it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| However, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| it sounds like a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| are concerned about some other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| other than harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| They're concerned about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| other political issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| before this nation and this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| and everywhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| such as restrooms, such as sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| So in any event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| that's what I've heard since Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I would also say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Again, for the good of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| the good of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| one other thing that this board could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| is to send it back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| and do something similar to what UT has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| And UT has put in their harassment policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| that changes to applicable law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| and or binding legal precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| may impact the applicability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| of certain provisions of this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| So this board could look at something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| you know, instead of having to change the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| That's what I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you, Mr. Diepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Mr. Watson and then Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I think it was that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| A lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Thank you, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| and thank you for those who chose to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| and speak to the issue in front of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| and also those who reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| and communicated to us this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Mr. Diepler, I just want to confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| that I heard something correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I think both in policy review and the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| I remember you stating that in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| in our policy manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| this type of language is already reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| to just the word sex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Or am I misremembering that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| I know we had that discussion relative to Legal Guardian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| but is that also true of this particular topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| where there is other language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| that just says sex in other policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Are there any other existing policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| that state this more full language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| that we still have on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| or is this the only one that you're aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| I was reminded of that the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| and Mr. Mayshark and I talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| but I hadn't looked at the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| I believe there is one that talks about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| perhaps in the employee section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| In the employee section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| The reason I'm asking you those questions, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| is because I think the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| and I think the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| has come to this in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| and I do think it was an attempt to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| simplify the policy, as Ms. Owen stated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| We've taken similar steps in other areas right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| like the Legal Guardian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| and to be able to bring some more clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| That being said, I was disappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| very much so in some of the emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| that I received this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| in that, just like Ms. Owen stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| for some, this change does signal something to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| and something to me that, again, to Mr. Dupler's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| the board has not intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| to make a socio-political statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| at least I hope we have not in this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| I would hope that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| a much more robust discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| if that's something that we were going to present in the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| but there's definitely people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| who have watched this and who have followed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| and who are making the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| that Knox County Schools, by reducing this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| is making some type of statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| and in some ways, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| are thinking we are making a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| that actually could feel harassing to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| which is interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| because it's an anti-harassment policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| which is really unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| that we would be shifting language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| and people would use that as an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| maybe not to directly harass somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| by sending us an email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| but certainly have indicated to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| they're more than willing to harass somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| in the larger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| And so, for that reason, I can't support this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| I do support the idea of bringing it back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| and seeing if we can have a more robust discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| about what do we do need to do to shift this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| both to continue to offer the protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| that we want to offer and need to be offering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| but also to make it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| Yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| I think the people who probably emailed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| and probably all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| probably hope that their statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| was a stamp of approval to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| At least for me, it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| It was very much seeing the uglier side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| of what this thing is trying to actually do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| and to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| And as a person of faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| I'm against all forms of harassment of anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| no matter whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| I agree with anything that you choose to do in your life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| or not do in your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| And by me saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| I'm not making a statement about this particular policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| So, anyway, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| To me, that was really unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| Thank you, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| So, is a motion required for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| to send it back to policy review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| And the reason why I think I suggest this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| is because I don't think we had this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| about this doing policy review and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| And so I think we need to go back and look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| or we may spend the rest of this evening talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| But I think it's worth talking about again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| So, is there a motion required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| If so, I'd make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| I think it would be up to, I don't know, Susan, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Who made the original motion? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Ms. Horne made that original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| and it was seconded by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| And basically, what my understanding is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| or my desire is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| is that you make a motion and put it on the floor for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| because you can't discuss it until you make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| So, but, well, I guess the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| what's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| I need to listen to the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| We can do a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| You can make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| So, I would make the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| that we send this back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| I still have discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| So, Ms. Horne, I think you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| No, I'm sorry, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| You were next for discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Yeah, I just think we need to make it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| how these policies end up on the agenda anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| I mean, and, you know, maybe, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| you can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| but we are required as a board to review our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| And that's why we have regular policy review meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| We take it by sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| And when we review a section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| and language has changed or state law has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| we typically change our policies to reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| It happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| You see it frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| I think that there might be some misconceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| that the board just randomly pulled this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| So, I do want to make it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| how this policy ended up on this agenda to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| Just in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| And maybe you can speak to the frequency of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| I don't know if it's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| but I do think that's important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| I think you said it best, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| I mean, these policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| it's the board's primary duty to enact policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| And so, as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| these policies are constantly being looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| Now, I mean, it's not just the whole policy manual every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| It's usually, you know, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| a section or two every two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| But, yeah, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| unless there's some type of specific legal change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| you know, they're not just picked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| And this one in particular, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| was just part of a group of student policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| that was up for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you, Mr. Dupleur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Yeah, I mean, I think I'm glad you brought that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| that this is just a policy that we were reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| and this is not the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| making some sort of political statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| I think the public is trying to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| sound like we're making a political statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| That's not what we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| This is changing to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| I think if you read the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| you see that we're not tolerating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| harassment of students from anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| toward anyone in any group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| So I'm fine with taking it back to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| but I'm in favor of changing it to be a more broad term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| because I think it does include everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| And I think if we start having a list of groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| that we're going to have a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| that's like 400 pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| So I think that we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| we really need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| And, you know, as Mr. Watson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| we're trying to focus our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| so that they are as concise as they can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| but also communicate what they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I would certainly never want anybody to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| that this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| did not care about the safety of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| As Dr. Reiswick said at the very beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| we care about the safety of every student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| regardless of who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| So that never came up in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| That was never part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| I think in policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| I think we did talk about that the intention was to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| to match other policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| and to be in line with the policies that we have elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| that simply have that list that we do see in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| So I'm fine with taking it back to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| but I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| basically that's my opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Yeah, the truth is the policy would have the same effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| if we put a period after the word reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| It does not discriminate in its programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| nor does it tolerate harassment for any reason, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Harassment is defined and go down to that last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| It would have the same weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| I do think that if you start getting into naming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| you're just going to be, I mean, how far are you going to go with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| So I'm content with the policy as we have edited it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| but if we want to take it back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| and have the same discussion, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| But I'm content with the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| I agree with Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| I'm fine with the policy the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| but if we want to take it back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| and have a more robust discussion again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| I'm fine with that, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| I guess so we're now, oh, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| So the policy, the other policy that Mr. Dupre was representing was G220,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| and that's actually our employee harassment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| It would probably be good to discuss both at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| because if they both have the similar language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| my guess is at some point when that came around in that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| we would have the same conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| and we should probably address both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| And to the point of some of our public forum speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| as I stated already, I do think the intent of the board was in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| and we came to this honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| If you look at our collective histories in the U.S.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| certain things we say send certain messages to certain people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| whether or not we want to or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| And somebody, I think, made the point to employees that might be LGBTQ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| or other who might perceive this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| And if we get into the same conversation with that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| around our employees and harassment, there's signals that get sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| We've seen the evidence of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| And again, like Mr. Dupre said, on both sides of the aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| So I think it's important not only for us to bring this back to policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| but we should probably have a robust conversation about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| relative to both policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| If there's no more discussion, we will vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| Ms. Tocconi, can you read that substitute motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Substitute motion was to send policy J210, harassment of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| back to policy review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=2923)|

| 1:05:05| and we talked about that at the TSBA convention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| and several schools spoke to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| and so this would encourage the legislature to adjust that statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| so that we could use those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| If it passes, I'm going to get you a T-shirt that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| Open the Cake Walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| I love cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Who doesn't love cake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Cake is one of my favorites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| It makes people happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| There was a bill for this last part of this session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| that did not move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| I'm not sure exactly why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| For a school to be able to do something like a cake walk at a fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| they have to request permission more than a year in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| from the Secretary of State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| It's a ridiculous process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| Because they consider that just like any kind of game of chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| Any kind of game of chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| So I guess the little ducks with the numbers on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| So it's a pretty big deal for something very small at a school fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| For 50 cents, like a 50-cent duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| We just want a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| I think our legislators understand that there's an issue there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| so I'm not sure why it's not being corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| As a former VTO President who ran a fall festival and a cake walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| I fully appreciate what you're doing here, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| It's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| Reverend Butler, did you have your light on earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Mr. Diepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| I was just going to add that I don't know how many times I've been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| are we able to raffle an American Girl doll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| But you can auction it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| So this would change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Yes, for the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Yes, so I would, I mean, you would think that they could enact something on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| that would help all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| So truly, like, let's try to push for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| because that would be, for one, the ease of Mr. Diepler's job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| and all the PTO PTA Presidents, and it would be so helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| Ms. Owen, I did have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| The teacher evaluation portion is just lifted from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| Is that still good and appropriate as you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4060)|
| 1:07:48| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| And thank you for those who gave your suggestions to Ms. Coatney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| and Ms. Coatney for putting that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I think there's some good suggestions this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| Seeing there's no more discussion, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| I love that we're ending this meeting on cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| That makes me happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| Yes, Mr. Triplett, are there any more public forum speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| Seeing that there are no more public forum speakers, we are now adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240111?start=4109)|
