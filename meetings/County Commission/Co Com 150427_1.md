| 2:10:53| We've been celebrating for the last couple of years the sesquicentennial of the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7853)|
| 2:11:00| For my people, the Civil War was, you know, it ended well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| but in Tennessee it didn't necessarily start well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| But I vote for these things because I understand there's a greater good that came out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7869)|
| 2:11:15| Similar with this resolution, you don't have to agree with all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| but, you know, for the mayor to veto it, for us to revisit it months later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| did you hear all the organizations that were called out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| Did you hear them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Did you see the number of folks that came down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| It was a good resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| You don't have to agree with 100 percent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| A lot of our votes, and we know that, a lot of our votes are tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| They're not 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| I'm right behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| They're that 49-51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| You know, we look at it, we evaluate it, and we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| But, you know, to make a big deal because one out of 40 you don't agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| two out of 40 you don't agree with, you know, it really does equate to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| you know, just not supporting any of the Civil War events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| because I didn't agree with most of what was going on here in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| So I guess I struggle with why we're even engaging in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| There's not, as you said, there's not abuse with the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| We haven't abused that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| That's not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| We had, what, two or three this month on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| We can now have Jill pull it for two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| That's the reason we did away with the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| Now we want to redo the rules because I didn't like one part of one resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7949)|
| 2:12:36| Commissioner Brose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| I have some things that I'm going to pass around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| I made a copy for, I did some research, had some help with that, which I appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| and I'm going to pass it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| I've got plenty of copies for each commissioner, for every member of the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| and for several of the other people who are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| Sam, would you take those for me, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| Last month I submitted two honorary resolutions to the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| One recognized local journalists who had won an award during the previous year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| and the other recognized all the women's groups in Knox County in honor of Women's History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7993)|
| 2:13:20| And every year since I've been a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| I do a special resolution in some way in honor of Women's History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8003)|
| 2:13:29| And as I continued my research and discovered more award-winning journalists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| and more women's groups, I added them to the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| I should point out that it is common to edit resolutions after they have been added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| There is nothing unusual about that, regardless of some comments to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8024)|
| 2:13:51| However, the resolution honoring women's groups has been criticized by some commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| and has also been vetoed by the mayor on the basis of misusing procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| However, the process and procedure were the same for both resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| Additionally, another commissioner submitted an honorary resolution past the official deadline last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8046)|
| 2:14:13| That the mayor and some commissioners are choosing to criticize one but not the other two is very telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8053)|
| 2:14:21| It is inconsistent at best and hypocritical at worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| The true reason for the veto and the criticism was because the honorary resolution included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| Planned Parenthood and the Knoxville Center for Reproductive Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| Yes, they do provide abortion care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| However, they also provide birth control, pap smears, breast exams, STI testing and treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8078)|
| 2:14:45| PMS and menopausal services, testing and treatment for urinary tract infections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8085)|
| 2:14:51| HPV testing, HIV screening, and gynecological exams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| And they are also two of only a few places, in addition to the Lisa Ross Center, which was also recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8097)|
| 2:15:04| where low-income or uninsured women can access these critical and often life-saving services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8104)|
| 2:15:12| The resolution also included 39 other women's groups, and the mayor's actions were disrespectful to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8112)|
| 2:15:20| It was a large list and very, very diverse, which I think shows how fortunate we are here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8120)|
| 2:15:27| to have so many groups organized around or in support of women of all ages, interests, and beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8127)|
| 2:15:33| And frankly, there were groups on that list that I personally would not choose to participate in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8133)|
| 2:15:39| but to leave them off would have been discriminatory and simply wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| The point of the honorary resolution was to simply recognize and honor all of these groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8144)|
| 2:15:50| for their service and support to the women of Knox County, which make up more than 51% of our county's population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8150)|
| 2:15:57| Last month, two commissioners made an attempt to silence the reading of the entire resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| honoring women's groups into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| One had the respect and decency to approach me privately before it was read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| and honest enough to admit afterwards that it was because it made him uncomfortable to recognize Planned Parenthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8169)|
| 2:16:16| The other broke into the process without asking permission or being recognized to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| The reason was ostensibly to protect the feelings of any women's group who might have been left off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| However, there was no such concern shown for the feelings of any journalist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| who might have been left off of the list of that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| So it would seem that the true motivation might have been just to silence the mention of women's groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| which made him uncomfortable or with whom he disagrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| That maneuver was not lost on a single woman who was here and several remarked on it afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| The resolution was passed unanimously by the commission. It was read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8211)|
| 2:16:56| The groups that were honored were here to receive their copy of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| and we had a wonderful, empowering moment standing together at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| The mayor cannot take that away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| And I have more respect for my colleagues than to push them into an uncomfortable situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8227)|
| 2:17:13| So I saw no need to resubmit the resolution this month and go through all of that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| I'm quite content to allow the mayor to go down in history as the only mayor to ever veto an honorary resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| that recognized and honored the women of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8248)|
| 2:17:37| Now, at this point, some commissioners are choosing to make an issue over the protocol and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| for submitting items for our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| As I said, I did some research which I passed around and since January of 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| 144 items have been added to our agendas past the official deadline for submitting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8271)|
| 2:17:59| These items have been added by county departments, county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| and even several times by our county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| There was nothing dishonest, nor sneaky, nor unusual about the resolution I submitted last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8286)|
| 2:18:13| nor in the way it was submitted or edited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| And additionally, the complete list of women's groups was posted and available before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8297)|
| 2:18:23| Some commissioners simply failed to do their homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| The fact that the other commissioner's honorary resolution was not criticized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| or my other resolution honoring award-winning journalists was not criticized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8312)|
| 2:18:37| points to the fact the problem was not with procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| but with the fact that some are uncomfortable recognizing women's groups they simply dislike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| Additionally, I'm disappointed to find a double standard in place for handling resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| One expectation for the only female commissioner, and a different standard for the remaining commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8331)|
| 2:18:58| I would expect individuals of integrity and conscience to admit their error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| and to apologize for making false accusations and name-calling in the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8343)|
| 2:19:10| Now it's not my desire to go through the whole list here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| but resolutions have been added late by Engineering and Public Works, Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| Parks and Recreation, Election Commission, Finance, Audit Committee, Sheriff, Purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| KCDC, MPC, General Sessions, Judges, IT, Human Resources, Drug Court, Library, Solid Waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8366)|
| 2:19:33| Law Director, Criminal Court Clerk, Community Development, and the Knox County Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8373)|
| 2:19:38| as well as Commissioners Schaus, Wright, Hammond, Larry Smith, Norman, OMB, Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| Anders, Bussler, and Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| Now these late additions were all resolutions and ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| and there was absolutely no criticism about them being added late when they were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| Our county mayor himself has added five late items to the agenda, including a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8395)|
| 2:20:03| The commission rules we did have before, which limited each commissioner to one primary sponsorship each calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8403)|
| 2:20:13| and that was changed under the recommendation of the Rules Committee under the leadership of Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8413)|
| 2:20:22| So this was not at all about, and, you know, Bob, you are new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| and if you had not read the entire commission rules and didn't know what the procedures were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| that's perfectly understandable, and I have no quarrel with that, and I'm glad that you do know now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| But it's obvious to me, it's obvious to all the women who are here supporting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| Some of them are wearing yellow roses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| If the significance of that you're unsure of, we'll be happy to educate you afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| Some are not, but it's obvious to all of us what this is really about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| It's not about policy and procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| It's about one female commissioner recognizing women's groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| an incredibly diverse and inclusive list of women's groups in Knox County during Women's History Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8467)|
| 2:21:14| and some male commissioners being uncomfortable with that, and that's simply unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8474)|
| 2:21:21| And I'm sure there are some women here who would like to speak about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| and some men also who are here to speak about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| So that is what I had to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| I have copies of my written statement that I will be happy to pass around to the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8493)|
| 2:21:39| as well as I said of the research I did of the 144 items that have been added late over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8499)|
| 2:21:47| There's two people that have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8507)|
| 2:21:55| Gary Elgin, are you here, Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| You want to go ahead and speak, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| You've got to give your name and address in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| E-L-G-I-N?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8524)|
| 2:22:05| Gary Elgin, E-L-G-I-N, 4808 Green Meadow Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8525)|
| 2:22:14| I'd like to thank you very much for this opportunity to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| It's my first time ever speaking before this body, and it is indeed an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| But I'm even more honored to speak about the good work and services provided to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8543)|
| 2:22:32| by all of the women's organizations listed in that resolution submitted by Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8552)|
| 2:22:42| It is amazing to think about the selflessness that happens in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8562)|
| 2:22:52| Yes, we live in the volunteer state, but women are the backbone and oftentimes the driving force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8572)|
| 2:23:02| behind many of the organizations that do the good work for this county, for this city, for this state, for this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8582)|
| 2:23:11| It is never too late to honor the good work of women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8591)|
| 2:23:18| and I would encourage each and every one of you to do so in your own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8598)|
| 2:23:25| And although Commissioner Broyles has suggested that this resolution not be resubmitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8605)|
| 2:23:34| I think it was a slap in the face to have it vetoed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| I think it was a slap in the face to every woman in Knox County to have that resolution vetoed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8618)|
| 2:23:47| The fact that we now know that it is the only ceremonial resolution to ever be vetoed and passed unanimously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8627)|
| 2:24:02| to me that's a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8642)|
| 2:24:07| And so I would respectfully suggest that it does indeed be resubmitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8647)|
| 2:24:16| and passed unanimously and without dissent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| Again, I would like to thank you for this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| and I would like to thank each and every woman of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| who gives their time and energy to make our county better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8678)|
| 2:24:53| My name is Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| I live at 2509 Lakefront Drive in Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| And I greatly appreciate the opportunity to be here to speak to all of you as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8699)|
| 2:25:06| And as you all know, I've been involved with many volunteer organizations and causes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8706)|
| 2:25:13| so this is, as a female citizen, this is a really important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8713)|
| 2:25:22| And also as someone who's been involved with the education of citizens in a citizen academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8722)|
| 2:25:32| I also feel like it's important as an example of citizens stepping up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8732)|
| 2:25:39| You know, we may not be always real comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| but I think it's a good example that we need to get up and speak to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| when it's really important and when we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| I'm proud to be a student of local government, and I hope that we can all say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8750)|
| 2:25:58| I mean, we're all continuing students of local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8758)|
| 2:26:03| But I have to say, one thing is really clear, that Commissioner Broyles didn't break the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| As she suggests, I also, as any citizen can, you can look up the rules online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8769)|
| 2:26:17| and it very clearly shows that she was well within the boundaries and followed all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8777)|
| 2:26:27| So I just would request that the Commission stand down from the fabricated issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8787)|
| 2:26:35| of the honorary resolution process being flawed as a deflection from the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8795)|
| 2:26:41| that you voted unanimously to support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| I'm sorry to see the situation that political pressures were unfairly injected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8804)|
| 2:26:51| into a great opportunity for many women's groups of all stripes to be recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8811)|
| 2:26:58| but you all are competent adults who will make a mature decision about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8818)|
| 2:27:06| The process of honorary resolutions is clearly not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8826)|
| 2:27:11| The process of honorary resolutions is clearly not the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| since late additions to the agenda are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| and as you heard occurred 144 times in the past by all members of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8837)|
| 2:27:25| But I have to say, admitting to not paying attention to official business is a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8845)|
| 2:27:32| particularly since paying attention is the job for which you're paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8852)|
| 2:27:38| That doesn't have to be the focus here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| You can just simply refuse to allow the Women's History Day resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| to be the distorted issue, the one that will be remembered and talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8867)|
| 2:27:53| And I just want to say finally that according to your own rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| respectful dialogue is required in this chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| I request that any commission chair, and I know sometimes that changes depending on who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8884)|
| 2:28:10| that you all work to uphold your rules about speaking in future meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8890)|
| 2:28:17| They're really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| And I understand no one's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| People get into heated discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| but interrupting your colleagues and showing disrespect and defying your own rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8907)|
| 2:28:33| which are enforced for a good reason, it interferes with your job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8913)|
| 2:28:39| and it also damages the prospect for people to really listen to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8919)|
| 2:28:51| So I just want to conclude with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| and thank you very much for listening to the citizens like you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8934)|
| 2:29:00| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8940)|
| 2:29:07| We don't have anybody else summed up on public forum for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| Is there anybody else that would like to speak in regard to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8952)|
| 2:29:22| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| My name's Carol Borges, and I live at 2511 Adair Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| And this is about Amy and the proposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| but I also think my biggest disappointment came from the fact that Planned Parenthood was singled out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8976)|
| 2:29:43| and that it gets so distorted about what their services are and why you should recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8983)|
| 2:29:49| And I just wanted to say, as a young woman, I had four children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| I had three of those children die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8993)|
| 2:29:56| Two of them were premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| One of them was a crib death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| I was psychologically totally devastated by this experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| And I went to my doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| I didn't have much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9007)|
| 2:30:08| I went to doctor after doctor looking for birth control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9008)|
| 2:30:12| because I knew if I had one more dead baby on my hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| I was going to have a nervous breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| And nobody listened to me except Planned Parenthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| And I think all of you should respect them because they do more than just give abortions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9026)|
| 2:30:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| My name is Wendy Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| I'm actually from Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| The address is 307 High Street in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9043)|
| 2:30:47| Commissioner, I do want to thank you all for giving me the opportunity to speak before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| I myself am a former county commissioner, so I am sensitive to the political pressures that you're all under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| I understand how the game is played and how difficult it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| But I stand before you tonight as the founder and chair of the East Tennessee Women's Leadership Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| one of the organizations that was recognized in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| This is a group of talented and dedicated professional volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| whose sole purpose is to do whatever we can to encourage the women of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9077)|
| 2:31:23| to step up and play a bigger role in the life and leadership of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9083)|
| 2:31:29| not just in Knoxville but in all around East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| We were honored, honestly, to be included among this incredibly diverse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| wide-ranging, and impressive group of organizations recognized by Commissioner Broyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| in her resolution during Women's History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| And I applaud her for such an all-inclusive list of organizations who do so much for women and girls here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9105)|
| 2:31:54| I founded my organization, the Leadership Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| after serving for many years on the Tennessee Women's Economic Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9118)|
| 2:32:03| where I was appointed by the speakers of the House and Senate to represent 16 counties of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| While serving in that role, I learned a great deal about the many factors that hold women back in our part of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9129)|
| 2:32:17| and the impact that that has on all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9137)|
| 2:32:22| Just recently, there was a new study out, the 2015 Status of Women in the States Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9142)|
| 2:32:28| Some of you may be familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| It ranked Tennessee in the bottom ten of all states in the country in the overall status of women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| based on a number of factors I won't go into here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9156)|
| 2:32:41| Although I live across the river these days, I am a Knoxville native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| I grew up here. I have lived in Tennessee all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| I am a proud Southerner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| I can say y'all with the best of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| But I am painfully aware that by almost any measure you choose to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9174)|
| 2:33:00| women in the South fall far behind their sisters around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9180)|
| 2:33:05| And within Tennessee itself, you may not know this, East Tennessee falls behind the rest of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9185)|
| 2:33:12| Now, this is especially disturbing to me because based on all kinds of research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9192)|
| 2:33:17| communities do better when women do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| Y'all know the saying, when mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| There's a practical side to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| When companies have 30% of women on their boards, they make more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9205)|
| 2:33:30| When women are in leadership positions in their community, their communities do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9210)|
| 2:33:34| There is tons of research to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| Because when women are at the table, the conversation changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| But when women are afraid to ask for a raise, seek a promotion, speak out about an injustice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9222)|
| 2:33:50| start their own business, say what they think, or run for office, all of us suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9230)|
| 2:33:57| Because when women don't show up, we miss the talents and strengths and clarity and wisdom that they bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9237)|
| 2:34:05| We miss the ideas, the ability to solve problems, just the simple different perspective that they bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9245)|
| 2:34:12| Not right, not wrong, just different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| Nowhere is this more evident than here with the body I'm standing before tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9255)|
| 2:34:21| where only one woman represents a county with over 400,000 people, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| When one woman's voice is silenced the way it certainly seems to me this seems to be about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9267)|
| 2:34:34| that says something that I don't think you all mean to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9274)|
| 2:34:38| Because your actions here today, y'all, impact leaders of the future, women and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9278)|
| 2:34:45| It says, don't bother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| It says, stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| It says, be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| Especially if what you're going to say makes us a little uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| And perhaps that doesn't matter to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| But if you have a daughter, a niece, a granddaughter, who herself may someday have a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9300)|
| 2:35:06| and something to say that you don't 100% agree with, she too might just stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9306)|
| 2:35:13| I know that's not the message you want to send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9316)|
| 2:35:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9317)|
| 2:35:25| Is that all from the audience on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9328)|
| 2:35:29| Commissioner Brown, what we're going to have to do is stop at seven and have zonings brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9329)|
| 2:35:36| It shouldn't be too long, but we'll have to stop and have zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| So if you could make your comments brief, Commissioner Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| I'd like to get some of this agenda stuff cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| I don't know how it can be done in two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| It's been inferred, not paying attention, not paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9349)|
| 2:35:55| Let me give you a fact, folks, and this is with a capital F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| It's not my defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| It's not an alibi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| It's not an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| Forty-eight hours before that meeting last month, I found my sister, my only sibling, dead in her yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9365)|
| 2:36:12| Now, how many of you would have come to the meeting that day had you been in that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9372)|
| 2:36:16| Again, I will say like I told the paper, after the first four or five names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| sure, I wasn't listening to the other 35 of them because my mind was on something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9381)|
| 2:36:27| I should have stayed home, but I came because I wanted to be and make a difference if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9387)|
| 2:36:34| The difference was made to the 144 items being added in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9394)|
| 2:36:39| You can check the records if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| but every single one of those was voted on by this body before it was allowed to be put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9401)|
| 2:36:49| I don't care if it was put on at that meeting day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| It has to be voted on before it's put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9412)|
| 2:36:56| That's the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| We're trying to silence the voice of women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9419)|
| 2:37:03| We're not trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9423)|
| 2:37:04| Nobody's trying to silence the voice of women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| I just want the women to be honest with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| Anybody up here on this panel would not put a resolution out to be read out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9430)|
| 2:37:17| that had something controversial that they knew 90% of the rest of the commission would not agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9437)|
| 2:37:25| if they knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| And I would bet you right now if you poll this August group, there's not, outside of Commissioner Brules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9447)|
| 2:37:34| there's not two people sitting around this table right now that can name more than six or seven of those 40 organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9454)|
| 2:37:43| Now, granted, they're fine organizations, but there's a place and a time for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9463)|
| 2:37:49| This body should not be honoring controversial or political views or organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9469)|
| 2:38:04| Commissioner Brules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9484)|
| 2:38:09| Mike, I've always been taught to respect my elders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| and I have mentioned more than once that you've been put through the wringer the last couple years physically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| and emotionally you've had several close people to you that you've lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9498)|
| 2:38:23| And I have always been, you've always had a great deal of compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9503)|
| 2:38:28| or I've always had a great deal of compassion for that and for the situation that you've been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| But just the facts that, or just the things that you said right now were, I'm sorry, but they were just incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9514)|
| 2:38:40| It wasn't 144 in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| It was 144 in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| I'm sorry, I have the floor, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9524)|
| 2:38:52| And, no, we don't have to vote on items to have them added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9532)|
| 2:38:57| So I'm sorry that you're upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| And what I told one person was that if picking on me helped relieve some of the anxiety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9540)|
| 2:39:08| and stress that you were under that weekend that you lost your sister, that I was happy to let you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9548)|
| 2:39:16| Because I think as I've explained to all of you on more than one occasion, you're not only my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9556)|
| 2:39:23| I have come to know most of you as my friends, and I have always expressed respect and love for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9563)|
| 2:39:33| I do expect it in return, and I have not received it in the past month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9573)|
| 2:39:38| with comments that have been made in the paper and publicly about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9578)|
| 2:39:44| So that's all that I have to say about that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9584)|
| 2:39:50| and I don't see any reason why we need to continue with this topic any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9590)|
| 2:39:57| I see no reason to bring this resolution up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| We've had our moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9600)|
| 2:40:01| It's time to move on with other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9601)|
| 2:40:04| And I want to thank everyone who came today to support this issue and to support me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9604)|
| 2:40:11| It means a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9613)|
| 2:40:22| We have, that's the end of that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| And so what I would like to do, I was looking through the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| and there's one item that's got, Todd Napier, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| We've got on page three, Resolution 15-4111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9632)|
| 2:40:40| And I'd like to go ahead and try to hear that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| If you guys don't mind, it'll get Todd out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9642)|
| 2:40:46| Go ahead, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| This is a resolution accepting the resignation of Nikki Dawson on the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9648)|
| 2:40:54| and the Health, Education, and Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9654)|
| 2:40:57| and approving the appointment of an individual to the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9657)|
| 2:41:03| and the Health, Education, and Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| to complete the unfulfilled term of Nikki Dawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| We need a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| What are the two names you have, Todd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| At the last, at the workshop, I brought before you two names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9679)|
| 2:41:22| and that's what we have for your consideration is Ms. Lynn Akers and Ms. Tamara Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9682)|
| 2:41:28| Ms. Boyer is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9688)|
| 2:41:29| Ms. Akers, due to a previous commitment, was not able to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| but I had passed out the bios for them at the workshop, and I've got a couple extras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| if someone doesn't have that and needs to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| And then, as I had mentioned, any Commissioner is welcome to present their own nominations as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9704)|
| 2:41:49| but these are recommendations to what we believe are very qualified individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| to fill this slot for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9720)|
| 2:42:06| It was a motion to approve with Ms. Boyer's name in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9726)|
| 2:42:14| I want to give you a little quick brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| The Development Corporation, the IDBs and all that, when they get together, they're a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| It's a little process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| It's not just somebody that Todd thought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| They come through with the nomination committee, and I've sat on it two or three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9745)|
| 2:42:29| and we've spent a couple of hours vetting names and asking people to show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| asking people to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| So these are not just pulled out of thin air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| This is a pretty vetted process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| Yes, I just wanted to say pretty much the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| that I've always been very impressed with all of the candidates that you have always submitted to us for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9762)|
| 2:42:48| I've always had a difficult time picking just one because they're all very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9768)|
| 2:42:54| So just for any of the Commissioners that are new to this process, they do an excellent job vetting these candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9774)|
| 2:43:01| So anyone that we appoint we know is going to do a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| We have a motion to approve Ms. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| That's kind of out of our custom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| Do you want to have a vote, or is it by affirmation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9791)|
| 2:43:16| Affirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9796)|
| 2:43:17| Affirmation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9797)|
| 2:43:18| Affirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9798)|
| 2:43:19| Affirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9799)|
| 2:43:20| Affirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9800)|
| 2:43:21| Is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9801)|
| 2:43:22| Is that good with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| Has anybody got any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| So we have a motion and a second to appoint Ms. Boyer to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9811)|
| 2:43:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9813)|
| 2:43:34| Thank you, Ms. Boyer, wherever you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9814)|
| 2:43:35| Right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9815)|
| 2:43:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| All right, let's go ahead and go into recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| It's 6.56, so at 7ish we'll come back in and begin the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9822)|
| 2:43:49| All right, Commissioners, I'm going to go ahead and call in to order the zonings for April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9829)|
| 2:43:55| Madam Clerk, if you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9835)|

| 2:44:26| Were you in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| Were you in here to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| I didn't have time to get my pants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| Whoa, Natalie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| I ain't going to look and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| All right, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9873)|
| 2:44:34| We've got people waiting after this, so let's go ahead and get rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9874)|

| 2:46:09| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9973)|
| 2:46:14| Where's the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9974)|
| 2:46:15| He's right behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9975)|
| 2:46:16| He's right behind Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9976)|
| 2:46:17| Both of them are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9977)|

| 2:46:31| Go ahead, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| Let's see, I got through my name, 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=9994)|
| 2:46:43| I would ask that this be approved pursuant to MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10008)|
| 2:46:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10013)|
| 2:46:54| Where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| He's back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10015)|
| 2:46:56| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| See you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10017)|
| 2:47:03| In the particulars that Arthur has mailed to all of us, I noticed there are a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10023)|
| 2:47:10| bunch of exceptions and diversions and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| They're really pushing the limit on this piece of property, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| There was quite a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| Dan Kelly, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| There was quite a discussion at the meeting itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10044)|
| 2:47:28| There was discussion regarding a conservation easement, discussion regarding a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10048)|
| 2:47:33| easement, both of which the developer has proposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10053)|
| 2:47:38| The Planning Commission, when it all came down to it, they recommended approval of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10058)|
| 2:47:42| rezoning at 3.9 units per acre, and that's what I'm here to represent tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10062)|
| 2:47:48| So you're comfortable with all of the exceptions and exclusions that have to be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10068)|
| 2:47:55| The Planning Commission voted to approve it at 3.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| But you're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| That's not my position here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| I'm here to represent the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| What was the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| It was pretty overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10091)|
| 2:48:15| While you're looking, this gets back to the earlier discussion we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| Maybe we haven't got to that point yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| We've been jumping around so much today about the need for schooling for planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10101)|
| 2:48:30| Sometimes these things come to us, 14.0, 15.0, and you look at them and you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10110)|
| 2:48:36| How in God's world could they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| Particularly over the suggestions and advice from professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10120)|
| 2:48:45| I don't know how long you've been in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| I remember when you came at least ten years ago, maybe 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10127)|
| 2:48:52| But at any rate, it disturbs me sometimes when they do things the way they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10132)|
| 2:49:02| Do you see any major problems with the exceptions that were made here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10142)|
| 2:49:08| Well, the vote was 13-1-1 was what the final vote was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10148)|
| 2:49:12| The discussion, again, the discussion revolved around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| they weren't discussing the actual density issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10157)|
| 2:49:21| It was about the conservation easement, and it was about the Greenway dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10161)|
| 2:49:28| Those were the items that were actually being discussed by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10168)|
| 2:49:32| and I believe they felt that it was a proper tradeoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10172)|
| 2:49:37| to get the conservation easement and the Greenway easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| and bump the density up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| The difference between what the staff recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10183)|
| 2:49:46| and what the Planning Commission actually approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| when it all comes out in the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| comes out to about six units on the whole piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10191)|
| 2:49:55| But it's still going to have to come back for a final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10195)|
| 2:49:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10198)|
| 2:49:59| And the Planning Commission has actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| since they have recommended approval of the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| they have gone on to approve a concept subdivision plan for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10204)|
| 2:50:09| So this item is moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10209)|
| 2:50:14| But there will have to be a final plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10217)|
| 2:50:18| Dan, did you say just ten lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10220)|
| 2:50:21| No, I said the difference between what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| the MPC staff recommended 3.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| It was approved by the Planning Commission at 3.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| The actual difference totals out at about six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| Arthur, I've got a few questions that kind of came up from a neighbor up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10240)|
| 2:50:41| One is, does Mr. Mosley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10241)|
| 2:50:43| he attempted to purchase a right-of-way for sewer through some private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10243)|
| 2:50:48| That was turned down, based on my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| Does he have a plan for the sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| Yes, and he already has a provision for sewer and water with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10253)|
| 2:51:02| I believe that's West Knox Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| He submitted a utility plan to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| But he's able to do that without encroaching on private property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10271)|
| 2:51:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| And part of Dogwood Road is actually in the state right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| and there's some discussion hopefully in the not-so-distant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| but probably distant future about redeveloping or redesigning that interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10287)|
| 2:51:28| And he's aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10288)|
| 2:51:29| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10289)|
| 2:51:30| And accommodations have been made to that, Dan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10290)|
| 2:51:32| Has that been factored in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| I don't think they have a final design for that, but he is aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| and the thought is it will not encroach on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10299)|
| 2:51:45| But it may change his access from Dogwood to Solway Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10309)|
| 2:51:50| And they've made accommodation for a greenway easement on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| In anticipation of the new road having a greenway and bike easement on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10316)|
| 2:52:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10322)|
| 2:52:03| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| Yeah, this question is for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10325)|
| 2:52:12| Mr. Kelly, I noticed that the staff had recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10332)|
| 2:52:14| that the peripheral boundary setback be reduced to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10334)|
| 2:52:20| Is this now becoming more of a standard with the MPC staff on projects less than 10 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10340)|
| 2:52:31| We're getting a lot more requests for that, let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10351)|
| 2:52:36| Up until a few years ago, the zoning ordinance required a 35-foot peripheral boundary setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10356)|
| 2:52:43| and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10363)|
| 2:52:45| It is now within the purview of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10365)|
| 2:52:49| If you recall, they set all the setbacks, both front, side, and rear setbacks for the dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10369)|
| 2:52:56| and now they have the authority to establish the peripheral boundary setback down to as low as 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10376)|
| 2:53:06| And we are seeing more of that than also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10386)|
| 2:53:11| Again, the development process, the homes and the lots that we're seeing being developed now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10391)|
| 2:53:20| are smaller lots in both width and depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10400)|
| 2:53:27| The lots are getting smaller, so that's why the setbacks are getting smaller also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| Would you think down the road that maybe the MPC should propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| that they make a change to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10417)|
| 2:53:40| to reduce the peripheral setback to 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10420)|
| 2:53:43| since that's pretty much what you guys are recommending on most projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| There's some that we've recommended even less than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| particularly when they adjoin another project that is being developed by the same developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10429)|
| 2:53:56| So the 15 to 35 gives them the option of anywhere in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10436)|
| 2:54:02| but if you would like for us to look at that, we can certainly look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| Okay. That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=10446)|

| 3:04:38| No, sir, the reason it came without recommendation is we were still in the late stages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| of negotiation with GRW, but those are complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11081)|

| 3:08:47| Is animal control here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| We had one person from the animal group here that wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11329)|
| 3:08:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11339)|

| 3:09:06| Brooks Brown, address is 1641 West Forest Boulevard, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11346)|
| 3:09:13| Thank you for considering these proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| As I said, my name is Brooks Brown, and I'm a small business owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11356)|
| 3:09:19| have been a resident of Knoxville and Knox County for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11359)|
| 3:09:22| and I'm a proud pet owner of 150-pound Great Dane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11362)|
| 3:09:26| I see that timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11366)|
| 3:09:27| I timed this last night at 5 minutes and 20 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| so don't pull an Oscars on me and start playing music, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11370)|
| 3:09:33| There's a kill switch right below you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11375)|
| 3:09:36| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11376)|
| 3:09:37| I'll fall through the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11377)|
| 3:09:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11378)|
| 3:09:39| I first contacted Commissioner Owen B. in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| and asked for his support in introducing some revised language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11382)|
| 3:09:45| to the county's Animal Care Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| and did so after observing a dog that a neighbor had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11387)|
| 3:09:52| that was left outside without adequate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11392)|
| 3:09:56| during the February ice and snow storm that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11396)|
| 3:09:59| An animal that typically responds immediately when spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11399)|
| 3:10:02| took literally 3 minutes to crawl out of this shelter that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11402)|
| 3:10:08| I wasn't sure that it would survive, but miraculously it did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| but at what physical cost, I'll never be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| It was suffering, no doubt, like so many other animals across Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| that are without adequate forms of shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| and who are exposed on a regular basis to extreme weather conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11420)|
| 3:10:24| including freezing temperatures, extreme heat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11424)|
| 3:10:27| and are often left in these inadequate shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| during severe thunderstorms, tornado warnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11429)|
| 3:10:32| and other serious weather events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11432)|
| 3:10:35| When you become a pet owner, just as when you become a parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11435)|
| 3:10:39| you accept responsibility for that living being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| who happens to be completely dependent upon your care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| And I know some of you may say that this argument is flawed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11445)|
| 3:10:48| because a human life is more valuable than that of an animal, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11448)|
| 3:10:54| Nonetheless, a domesticated animal is still dependent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11454)|
| 3:10:58| upon the care and protection of their owners as is a child to its parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11458)|
| 3:11:03| I'm not here asking for the Ritz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| but I am here asking and helping to lend a voice to those that don't have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11466)|
| 3:11:11| and to say that it is the responsibility of every pet owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11471)|
| 3:11:15| to provide their domesticated animals with adequate shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11475)|
| 3:11:18| sufficient food, clean water, and protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11478)|
| 3:11:21| Soon after contacting Commissioner Owen B.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| I created the Knox County Animal Cruelty Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11483)|
| 3:11:26| which is a community-based organization led by an advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| whose members are Knox County citizens and taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11491)|
| 3:11:35| These advisory committee members have played a crucial role in promoting our effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| and I thank each of them for their hard work and determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| Commissioner Broyles soon joined as a co-sponsor of this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11502)|
| 3:11:45| and we thank both Commissioner Broyles and Owen B. for their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11505)|
| 3:11:49| We've worked tirelessly over the past two months to draft language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11509)|
| 3:11:52| that we believe is first and foremost fair to the animals concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11512)|
| 3:11:56| fair to the owners of these animals, and enforceable by animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11516)|
| 3:12:02| We've received more than 5,000 signatures to our online petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11522)|
| 3:12:07| more than 2,500 of whom are Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11527)|
| 3:12:10| and have received support from many local veterinarians, animal clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| boarders, and other animal rescue groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| who have shared our initiative socially through online avenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11537)|
| 3:12:22| Furthermore, each of you have received numerous emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11542)|
| 3:12:25| from nearly 500 Knox County taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11545)|
| 3:12:28| who have personally taken their time to contact you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| and express their support for this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11551)|
| 3:12:34| This isn't something that I typically do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11554)|
| 3:12:36| I'm not the lobbying type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11556)|
| 3:12:38| and not one to step out on a limb and advocate for something so publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11558)|
| 3:12:43| But I recognized the need, saw that nothing was being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11563)|
| 3:12:46| and surrounded myself with people far more talented than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11566)|
| 3:12:51| I've spoken or attempted to speak with many of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| either by phone or through email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| and believe that not only is change possible, but it is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| Hundreds, if not thousands, of animals throughout our great county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11579)|
| 3:13:02| are subjected to inadequate shelter, lack of clean food and water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11582)|
| 3:13:07| and are exposed to extreme weather conditions on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11587)|
| 3:13:11| In a recent conversation that I had with Sheriff Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11591)|
| 3:13:14| he indicated that Animal Control is in support of this initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11594)|
| 3:13:18| and believes that it will help them prosecute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| or enforce more egregious instances of neglect throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11601)|
| 3:13:27| Furthermore, I want to reinforce quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| what Commissioner Owenby has stated publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11609)|
| 3:13:31| which is that this is not a policing effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| We are not seeking for Animal Control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11613)|
| 3:13:36| to drive up and down neighborhood streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11616)|
| 3:13:38| to point out instances of infractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| Instead, this ordinance would be enforced much like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11621)|
| 3:13:46| It would not only be complaint-driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11626)|
| 3:13:48| but enforced much like the noise ordinance is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11628)|
| 3:13:53| These changes provide more clearly defined definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11633)|
| 3:13:56| for adequate shelter, nutritional requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11636)|
| 3:13:58| as well as what constitutes an extreme weather condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| Thus, Animal Control officers will now be better equipped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11641)|
| 3:14:05| when responding to complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| and will be empowered by the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11647)|
| 3:14:09| to determine whether or not an infraction has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| based upon more clearly defined requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11651)|
| 3:14:14| Currently, the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| has a far more comprehensive animal care ordinance than does the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11656)|
| 3:14:20| Also of note is the fact that there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11660)|
| 3:14:22| multiple public relations initiatives in recent years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11662)|
| 3:14:25| to promote Knox County and the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11665)|
| 3:14:28| as one of the most pet-friendly counties in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11668)|
| 3:14:31| These PR initiatives have been coupled with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| private capital investments in outdoor pet-friendly facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| and multiple pet-friendly events throughout the county and city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11676)|
| 3:14:39| We applaud these efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| but what is often publicly overlooked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| are the hundreds of complaints of neglect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| reported to Animal Control on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11685)|
| 3:14:48| To be truly pet-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| Knox County has the opportunity here and now on this very evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| to effect change for the instances of neglect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11694)|
| 3:14:57| that go unseen to the public eye on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11697)|
| 3:15:00| and to truly begin to claim a rightful title as pet-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11700)|
| 3:15:05| On behalf of the thousands of Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11705)|
| 3:15:08| supporting these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11708)|
| 3:15:09| it is my sincere hope that you will as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11709)|
| 3:15:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11712)|
| 3:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11713)|
| 3:15:14| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11714)|
| 3:15:19| And if time permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11719)|
| 3:15:21| Commissioner Anders, we have two other expert witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11721)|
| 3:15:26| that would like to mention a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| Okay, just a second. Commissioner Oldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11728)|
| 3:15:31| Yeah, I just want to piggyback on what Brooks had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11731)|
| 3:15:36| I talked to the city about this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11736)|
| 3:15:40| so that we could kind of mirror| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11740)|
| 3:15:42| and Vice Mayor Pavlis has been gracious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| and worked with me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11746)|
| 3:15:47| He's actually going to look at some of ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11747)|
| 3:15:53| to incorporate in theirs as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11753)|
| 3:15:56| like when it comes to extreme weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11756)|
| 3:15:59| because it's not very well defined even in the city side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| I think this is something that's long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11762)|
| 3:16:07| In February, we had over 20 people that died because of cold weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11767)|
| 3:16:16| I just wonder how many animals were actually perished during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11776)|
| 3:16:22| And I'm glad that Brooks contacted me about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11782)|
| 3:16:26| and it's been my pleasure to work on it with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| and the law department to kind of draft something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| that I think is enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| and can help our law enforcement out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11794)|
| 3:16:39| when they do get the calls that they can be able to enforce something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| a lot more strenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11802)|
| 3:16:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11804)|
| 3:16:46| Is there anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11808)|
| 3:16:49| Thanks, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| I would like to add one thing for everybody to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11811)|
| 3:16:55| Several of the people in this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11815)|
| 3:16:58| have served with the Young-Williams Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11818)|
| 3:17:02| which is the official contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11822)|
| 3:17:08| Yeah, let's say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11828)|
| 3:17:10| They do an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| I currently serve on their board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11832)|
| 3:17:15| And I'm assuming that when we find an extreme circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11835)|
| 3:17:22| where somebody has to take something into their own hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11842)|
| 3:17:26| the county animal control, this is where they're going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11846)|
| 3:17:31| So how many people have been to Young-Williams Animal Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11851)|
| 3:17:36| You know what a great job they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11856)|
| 3:17:39| And I would encourage everybody here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| because sitting on their board, I know finances are tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11861)|
| 3:17:47| If you can help them financially, donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11867)|
| 3:17:51| any events they have, it would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11871)|
| 3:17:57| Is there anybody from the audience that wanted to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11877)|
| 3:18:05| Stephanie Hickey, 5956 Warren Park Lane, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11885)|
| 3:18:11| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11891)|
| 3:18:12| Again, my name is Dr. Stephanie Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11892)|
| 3:18:14| I'm a veterinarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11894)|
| 3:18:16| and the owner of Admiral Veterinary Hospital in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11896)|
| 3:18:19| As a member of the Knox County Animal Cruelty Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11899)|
| 3:18:22| I have been the advisor on the animal health side of our proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11902)|
| 3:18:27| As domestic animals, dogs and cats, whom are owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11907)|
| 3:18:30| rely solely on humans for their care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11910)|
| 3:18:33| As part of this care, domestic animals deserve adequate shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11913)|
| 3:18:37| This is especially true for dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| who are tethered or kept contained solely outside in a pen or a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| The requirement for adequate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| could mean the difference in the health or even life of these dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11925)|
| 3:18:49| The health concerns are numerous for dogs not given adequate shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11929)|
| 3:18:53| Exposure to the elements from heat, wind, rain, hail, snow, ice, and lightning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11933)|
| 3:18:58| can all end up with fatal consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11938)|
| 3:19:01| Providing adequate shelter, as outlined in the proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| can keep a pet safe from these elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| This also provides a consistent message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11946)|
| 3:19:09| between the care of animals in the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11949)|
| 3:19:13| All residents of these areas should be held to the same standard of care for their pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11953)|
| 3:19:17| as not providing shelter is dangerous for the pet and cruel, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11957)|
| 3:19:22| As we have seen this past winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| Knoxville is not immune from severe temperature swings or extreme weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11964)|
| 3:19:28| Animals in freezing temperatures can become hypothermic in under an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11968)|
| 3:19:32| and if care or heat is not provided, these animals can perish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11972)|
| 3:19:36| I have seen a coonhound firsthand that froze to death in his pen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11976)|
| 3:19:40| because he did not have adequate heat or shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11980)|
| 3:19:42| There was no ordinance in place, so this was not considered illegal or cruel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11982)|
| 3:19:46| That needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11986)|
| 3:19:49| Certain breeds of dogs are more immune to sub-freezing temperatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11989)|
| 3:19:53| but even a husky can become frostbitten on its paws if standing on ice for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=11993)|
| 3:20:00| On the reverse side of this, summer is coming soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12000)|
| 3:20:03| and that same husky could die of heat stroke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| if left without adequate shelter in the 90-degree sun in under 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12005)|
| 3:20:10| Heat stroke is indeed more of an issue for the Knox County area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12010)|
| 3:20:14| than even cold temperatures for pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12014)|
| 3:20:16| I treat cases of heat stroke more often than I do injuries from the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12016)|
| 3:20:21| Pugs, Boston terriers, bulldogs, and other flat-nosed breeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12021)|
| 3:20:24| are even more at risk for heat-related injuries and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12024)|
| 3:20:28| Short-haired breeds such as hounds, terriers, bully breeds, and retrievers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12028)|
| 3:20:32| can even become sunburned, especially if they have white hair and fair skin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12032)|
| 3:20:36| A severe sunburn can lead to infection and extreme pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12036)|
| 3:20:40| As you can hear, pets suffer without adequate shelter from extreme weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12040)|
| 3:20:44| Ideally, I wish that all pet owners would bring their dogs and cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12044)|
| 3:20:48| into a house or interior shelter when extreme weather occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12048)|
| 3:20:52| but this ordinance is the first step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12052)|
| 3:20:56| All pets should be protected from the weather in a manner to prevent harm or death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12056)|
| 3:21:00| This is part of the responsibility of pet ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12060)|
| 3:21:03| It makes sense to have this ordinance as part of Knox County law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12063)|
| 3:21:07| Animals are living, breathing creatures we are responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12067)|
| 3:21:10| and should want to prevent them from becoming ill or injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12070)|
| 3:21:13| If we could help in doing so, why would we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12073)|
| 3:21:16| Thank you for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12076)|
| 3:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12078)|
| 3:21:23| Is there anybody else that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12083)|
| 3:21:30| I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| Good evening. My name is Crystal Hamm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| I actually have two addresses, one here in Knoxville, 5816 Metropolitan Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12094)|
| 3:21:38| and one in Loudoun, 102 Kiowa Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12098)|
| 3:21:42| I am a licensed private investigator here in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12102)|
| 3:21:46| I'm also a nationally certified animal cruelty investigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12106)|
| 3:21:49| When winter storms hit in February, there was a great concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12109)|
| 3:21:53| about the welfare of the animals that had been kept outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12113)|
| 3:21:56| during these extreme conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12116)|
| 3:21:59| Like she said, they're less favorably than the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12119)|
| 3:22:03| that are more adequately equipped with longer hair for such conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12123)|
| 3:22:08| I received several phone calls from concerned citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12128)|
| 3:22:11| asking if I could drive by certain residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12131)|
| 3:22:14| and see if these animals were legally and adequately prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12134)|
| 3:22:17| for upcoming weather conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12137)|
| 3:22:20| These individuals felt that when the storms came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12140)|
| 3:22:22| the animals would be in danger if they were not adequately cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12142)|
| 3:22:27| One particular house I arrived at, there were three short-haired mixed-breed dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| Two of them were chained in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| One of them was chained in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| From the street, I could see that each had food and water bowls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12156)|
| 3:22:39| but was unsure of what the contents held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| There also was a plastic housing similar to igloo dog houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12162)|
| 3:22:46| These houses were sitting directly on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12166)|
| 3:22:49| There was no bedding inside, and one of them was actually sitting on its side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12169)|
| 3:22:54| The problem with that is that the houses now have direct contact with the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12174)|
| 3:22:59| and that was going to soon be frozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12179)|
| 3:23:02| and that would not give the animal the ability to maintain their own body temperatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12182)|
| 3:23:08| With the weather conditions and temperatures dropping to below freezing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12188)|
| 3:23:11| I knew that the water that could be in some of those bowls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12191)|
| 3:23:14| would not remain in liquid form without some sort of a heat source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12194)|
| 3:23:18| and therefore would not be an adequate source of water for that animal in the hours to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12198)|
| 3:23:23| I contacted the animal control unit who sent out an officer to look at the situation and evaluate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12203)|
| 3:23:28| and to ascertain whether the animal was adequately prepared for these storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12208)|
| 3:23:32| I spoke to the officer after his investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12212)|
| 3:23:35| and he stated that legally the individual who owned the three dogs was not in violation of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12215)|
| 3:23:41| and in accordance to the current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12221)|
| 3:23:44| nothing could be done to ensure the animal's welfare during extreme weather conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12224)|
| 3:23:48| He felt that his hands were tied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12228)|
| 3:23:50| but that he, too, was concerned about these and other dogs that he had been seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12230)|
| 3:23:54| These were short-haired breed dogs left out and below freezing temperature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12234)|
| 3:23:58| having nothing but a plastic doghouse sitting on the frozen ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12238)|
| 3:24:01| and no access to water because it, too, would be frozen in a few hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| I believe our current ordinance needs to be changed to give animal control officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12245)|
| 3:24:09| the ability to assist in educating the individuals that they come in contact with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12249)|
| 3:24:13| teach them how to properly care for and prepare their animals for such extreme weather conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12253)|
| 3:24:19| The ordinance needs to be changed so that the minimum standards of care are more clearly defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12259)|
| 3:24:24| not only for the officers that have to enforce this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12264)|
| 3:24:27| but also for the owners so that they know what is expected of them as the caretakers of these animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12267)|
| 3:24:33| During my training and subsequent investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| I've had to, unfortunately, witness animals that were not adequately sheltered or properly taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12276)|
| 3:24:41| In one instance, I observed a short-haired pregnant dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12281)|
| 3:24:45| that was given a few sheets of plywood that was nailed together and given as inadequate shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12285)|
| 3:24:51| The shelter did not contain a floor, and it only had two walls and a roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12291)|
| 3:24:55| enabling the wind to go straight through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| Because it was sitting on the dirt, it allowed water, snow, and other things to get inside that shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12298)|
| 3:25:04| Finding a scrap of cloth a short distance away from the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12304)|
| 3:25:08| the chained dog curled up on top of it, trying to seek some warmth from the frozen ground and sub-zero temperatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12308)|
| 3:25:15| She was found dead by a neighbor the next day, still frozen to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12315)|
| 3:25:19| Several other dogs on the property had suffered minor to severe frostbite and had to be treated by a local vet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12319)|
| 3:25:25| All of this could have been easily prevented with a stronger and more clearly defined ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12325)|
| 3:25:30| These animals look to us to provide them with everything they need to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12330)|
| 3:25:34| They depend on us to know what is needed to keep them safe and healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12334)|
| 3:25:38| We would like for you to look at this ordinance and consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| knowing that we're simply trying to ensure the minimum care standards are applied for the health and welfare of the Knox County animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12340)|
| 3:25:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12348)|
| 3:25:56| Motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12356)|
| 3:25:58| Is there any other discussion among the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12358)|
| 3:26:01| All right, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12363)|

| 3:27:31| One no, so Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12451)|
| 3:27:34| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12454)|
| 3:27:35| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12455)|
| 3:27:36| Discussion regarding state legislation proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12456)|
| 3:27:39| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12459)|
| 3:27:40| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12460)|
| 3:27:41| Here's my, I've talked to several legislators in Nashville about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12461)|
| 3:27:49| and the reason I want to bring it up, just so we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12469)|
| 3:27:53| there may be hardly any discussion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| but just the fact that when we pass these proposals in favor or against of something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12475)|
| 3:28:02| I think we often just think that somehow really influences our legislatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12482)|
| 3:28:12| And what I'm driving at is it's more important from what I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12492)|
| 3:28:18| that if we call them and tell them we're against something or for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12498)|
| 3:28:23| that passing these proposals, I'm afraid sometimes we are in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12503)|
| 3:28:28| we believe falsely that that somehow is going to speak louder than if we all call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12508)|
| 3:28:34| And that was my point, is that we need to call our legislators to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12514)|
| 3:28:39| I'm not so interested in these proposals for or against because I'm not sure they have any teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12519)|
| 3:28:45| And that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| Well, that goes for the general public, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12527)|
| 3:28:53| If you haven't called one of your legislators in the delegation in the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12533)|
| 3:28:57| you probably should have because they've passed a lot of laws that we've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12537)|
| 3:29:01| and we've also taken a position on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| I think it's imperative that we do call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12543)|
| 3:29:05| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| I agree wholeheartedly, but I also say that there's a lot of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12547)|
| 3:29:12| and as I've said before, the state legislators for some reason have really chosen to get in our shorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12552)|
| 3:29:18| in a pretty big way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12558)|
| 3:29:20| So that's why I'm really looking forward to what's going to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12560)|
| 3:29:24| as far as a lobbyist or someone to represent our interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12564)|
| 3:29:29| That way if we overwhelmingly support a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12569)|
| 3:29:33| then they can take that mantra on our behalf because calling the individuals on every little one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12573)|
| 3:29:44| might get to be pretty prohibitive and they may stop listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12584)|
| 3:29:50| as opposed to having an organized front as far as what our interests are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12590)|
| 3:29:58| All right, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12598)|
| 3:29:59| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12599)|

| 3:30:08| Are we satisfied with that with our budgetary discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12608)|
| 3:30:11| Well, actually, what I was going to mention was, and this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12611)|
| 3:30:15| new people on the commission may not be aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12615)|
| 3:30:17| but the previous commission and previous school board had agreed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12617)|
| 3:30:22| whenever a potentially controversial item came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12622)|
| 3:30:29| rather than fighting it out in the press or discussing it in the press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12629)|
| 3:30:34| or however you want to describe it back and forth in the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12634)|
| 3:30:38| we would just meet together as a group and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| So I was hoping that we could set up a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12642)|
| 3:30:45| I know we've got meetings coming up just to talk about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12645)|
| 3:30:49| but I think it might be a good idea for us to also set up a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| just to talk about this issue of the new schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12652)|
| 3:30:55| because I think that's going to take up a pretty big chunk of time on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12655)|
| 3:31:01| So I just wanted to remind us of that, that we had agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12661)|
| 3:31:04| I anticipated that meeting being budgetary, both capital and operational stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12664)|
| 3:31:10| So I think if we can't get it done in one meeting, we'll have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12670)|
| 3:31:13| But that was the intent was to get all that done in one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12673)|
| 3:31:16| That was just a gentle reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12678)|
| 3:31:19| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12679)|
| 3:31:20| Yeah, and just as maybe a reminder to inform some of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12680)|
| 3:31:25| that we're going to meet on the joint education committee's going to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12685)|
| 3:31:29| on May 7th, Thursday, May 7th at 4.30 at the Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12689)|
| 3:31:37| So things like that, as Commissioner Burroughs alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12697)|
| 3:31:40| that was kind of the original point and purpose of the joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12700)|
| 3:31:44| But the first meeting, everyone's welcome, will be May 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12704)|
| 3:31:50| Anything else in regard to that topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12710)|
| 3:31:53| Anything else for commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12715)|
| 3:31:56| Yeah, an announcement, as I spoke of earlier, the Civil War Centennial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12716)|
| 3:32:04| I guess I got that right, will be concluding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12724)|
| 3:32:07| It's going to conclude this Thursday with a program at the Bijou Theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12727)|
| 3:32:12| starting at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12732)|
| 3:32:14| Start Thursday, not conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12734)|
| 3:32:16| It just starts off Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12736)|
| 3:32:19| Right, it starts the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12739)|
| 3:32:20| It starts the concluding weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12740)|
| 3:32:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12742)|
| 3:32:23| Yeah, so on Thursday, there's a professor, I forget her name, Carl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12743)|
| 3:32:30| She's from Purdue University, a historian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12750)|
| 3:32:33| She's going to talk about the Tennessee influence within the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12753)|
| 3:32:37| And then I'm proud to announce that at about 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12757)|
| 3:32:41| the Fisk Jubilee Singers, which I'm a proud alumni,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12761)|
| 3:32:45| will be performing at the Bijou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| If you've never heard the Jubilee Singers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12768)|
| 3:32:50| they're primarily Negro spirituals, a cappella, beautiful voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12770)|
| 3:32:55| I encourage everyone to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| But that's at the Bijou Theater Thursday beginning at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12777)|
| 3:33:04| Mr. Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12784)|
| 3:33:05| I just want to make a point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12785)|
| 3:33:09| I did not speak to Amy Broils due to the Sunshine Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12789)|
| 3:33:12| about anything that we may have talked about or voted on or could vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12792)|
| 3:33:18| So I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12798)|
| 3:33:20| So you're securing something that doesn't need to be cured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12800)|
| 3:33:22| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12802)|
| 3:33:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| I mean, you know, the Sunshine Law and the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12805)|
| 3:33:29| I did not talk outside the order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12809)|
| 3:33:32| Anything else before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12812)|
| 3:33:34| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=12814)|
