| 0:01:44| All right, thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| All right, before we begin the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| I'd like to call on Commissioner Daly to lead us in a pledge to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| Everyone please rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Everyone's salute, attention, pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=133)|
| 0:02:26| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| As we go in tonight's meeting, I know we've got a lot of really important items on tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=151)|
| 0:02:40| and probably after the initial call to public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| my fellow commissioners will work together to tighten up and set tonight's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| in the order of the discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| because I have had multiple requests from multiple commissioners and folks in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| for a couple of items to be moved towards the top of the agenda to take care of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| and then move into some of the business at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| And if it pleases this body, we will make those adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| But every county commission meeting, at the beginning and the end of each meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| we have the opportunity for a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| That's where anyone in the community can address this body on a matter that is important for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| and you believe that we need to be informed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| The rules for that are we limit folks to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| and that we ask that you step forward to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| state your name and address for the record, and then you have five minutes to make your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| Tonight, I've had a handful of folks who have informed us in advance that they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| No audio is on for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| For the TV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| On the TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| Okay, so I guess I'm sorry for those of you in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| I was just informed that those who may be watching our meeting on television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| they can't hear what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| So aren't you glad you're here live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| So back to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| I've had a handful of folks who addressed to speak on different items at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| I know we've got quite a few folks who have expressed an interest in talking about Chapman Highway at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| I've had multiple folks tell me and have pre-registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| I'd prefer, if at all possible, to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| We're going to have a separate discussion on Chapman Highway outside of the very beginning of the meeting public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| and if it pleases those who have already pre-registered to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| I'm going to ask that you wait until we get to the Chapman Highway section to talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| and I will treat that as a public forum specifically towards the Chapman Highway subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| Is that good with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Commissioner Biggs, I know you put that discussion item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| So just to clarify, we're moving the Chapman Highway discussion to the front of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| If it pleases this body, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| I do have a couple other items on public forum, too, that I want to get them taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| That will be briefer, and then we can move on to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| I know Reverend Butler had come in earlier, and he's got a five-minute statement before he jumped into Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| and I know he's got a lot of folks here, too, and they'll be here for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| With that said, my intention for this meeting, knowing how many folks are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| I do have a couple of brief public forum statements that we need to handle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| and then we will probably move the Chapman Highway discussion up towards the front of the agenda if it pleases this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=329)|
| 0:05:38| So the first person who is registered for a public forum is Reverend Dr. John Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=338)|
| 0:05:51| I'm John Butler, 1324 Iroquois Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=351)|
| 0:05:59| and I'm president of the Knoxville branch in AACP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| but I'm here this afternoon as a spokesperson for the Education Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| The Education Coalition, and those who are standing with me are members of all the organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| consists of the following organizations, Knoxville branch in AACP, Knox County Education Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=375)|

| 0:06:35| and Allies of Knoxville Immigration Neighbors, and each commission should have a copy of our statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=395)|
| 0:06:44| Our message to the Knox County Board of Education and the Knox County Commission is a simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| Support our students, give them the funding they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| The Education Coalition urges the Knox County Board of Education to submit a budget to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| that will fully support all of our students' educational needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| The Education Coalition urges the Knox County Commission to support our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| by fully funding Knox County public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| Nothing Knox County does is more important than educating our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| Our children are the future of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| Failure to invest in our children is failure to invest in our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| The quality of public schools affects the quality of life of our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| business and investment and development, as well as crime and safety in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| Knox County schools have been clear for fiscal year 2019-20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| it needs $32 million more than it received this year just to meet essential needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| Those needs include staff pay increases to keep up with the cost of living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| textbooks that keep up with state standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| trained staff to meet legal and moral obligations to students with special needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| and students learning English as their second language, and increased insurance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| These are basic essential investments we have to make to have the quality schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| we want our children and grandchildren to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| To have schools worthy of Knox County, to attract high quality businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| and to have the safe communities we want in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| So we say to the Board of Education, ask for the money our schools need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| and we say to the County Commission, give our schools the money that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| And thank you for your time, and now we all will take the last two minutes to depart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| so we won't disrupt the meeting anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=525)|
| 0:08:54| Thank you, Dr. Butler. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=534)|

| 0:10:25| One other person that, and this is not related to Chapman Highway, that expressed an interest in addressing commission is Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=625)|
| 0:10:33| If Victor Jernigan is here, I think I saw him earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| Victor, if you could please approach the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I'm here to speak specifically on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| Okay. All right. Thank you. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| I'll strike you off of that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| All right. Thank you, Victor and Kelly DeLuca, Ben and Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| Is there anyone else who on any other items would like to address county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| Okay. Not seeing any other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| I'd like to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| I also want to, there are a couple of items for the sake of helping keep our meeting a little bit shorter that I actually pulled off a consent when I was setting the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=672)|
| 0:11:21| so that if it's okay with my fellow commissioners, I may actually add to go back onto the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| One was regarding a few grants that the health department had received, and that was item 32, 33, and 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=689)|
| 0:11:38| Non-controversial, that was just a fairly sizable grant, so we should be grateful that our health department has received them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| But on a night with a busy agenda, we can probably put those back on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| And item 25, which was about us getting some snow plows, I was kind of surprised to see that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| But we can put that back on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=716)|
| 0:12:04| A couple of other things that are adjustments as we go through tonight's agenda, and I see Mr. Myers approaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| and I suspect that you're going to be updating us on item 36 if you'd like to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| Yes, sir. If I could defer that item 36 for 30 days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Okay. So item 36 will be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| Also, there are two other items on tonight's agenda for different reasons that when we get to them will need to be forwarded to next Monday with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=746)|
| 0:12:36| One is item 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| Per Dwight said to make sure it's tight, he would prefer for it to go forward to Monday's meeting with a no recommendation recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| And the item number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| They're waiting on some paperwork from the governor for item number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| So those two items need to be sent forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| 48 is just a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Dwight, well, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| Well, it may be a presentation. I'm just telling you the email that he sent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| So he said, and I quote, out of an abundance of caution, he said he would prefer to see it sent forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| So we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| So, Dwight, if you're here, you can chime in on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| I'm not sure if he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| He is. He's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| Okay. Dwight, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=809)|
| 0:13:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Yes, sir, if we could just move it to next week, that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| We'll have agencies here as we traditionally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| And the only thing we might ask is, since we'll have a bunch of folks here, if we could move it to the front of the agenda next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Are there any other changes or additions to tonight's agenda, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| I would like to move my two items, 51 and 52, to next week, since it looks like we're going to have a long night tonight, or could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| And also, the one that we were talking about, the discussion of parks, Mr. Dwight would like to bring his staff and help discuss that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=854)|
| 0:14:23| and if we could move that more to the front of next week's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| 52 is the one I would like to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| The other one would just stay in a regular discussion area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| I think you had one about the Governor Lee's plan, and then you had the other about the parks and rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| Put the parks and rec to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Parks and recs to the front of next week's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| But both items will be to confirm moved to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| 52 to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Is there any other additions to tonight's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Mr. Bussler, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| The one change that I'd like to make to this month's agenda, I've had commissioners and other folks ask to move this towards the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| is the discussion item on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| So I'd like to go ahead and get that bit of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| That's item 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Move that one to the top of our agenda, and then once that one is done, we will proceed to work through the rest of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=928)|
| 0:15:36| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Chair, I just want to make sure that number five is not on consent and move it with no recommendation to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=938)|
| 0:15:47| Yeah, item five will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| Any other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| That will be tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| I don't think we need to have a vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| So I do need a motion for approval of the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| We have a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| What we'll do is we will go ahead and begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Madam Clerk, if you could go ahead and call this next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| This is the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Don't we have to make a motion to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Make a motion to set the agenda with the additions, corrections, and the deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| We have a proper motion from Commissioner Skinmaker and a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| And I'd like to recognize and thank Mayor Jacobs for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| He just joined us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Mayor Jacobs, do you have anything you'd like to say to Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Madam Clerk, if you could go ahead and call this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| This is item number 49 on page 8, discussion item regarding the safety of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Commissioner Biggs, you put this item on the agenda, so if you could go ahead and start this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Just to give you a little bit of backstory, some time ago in February, whenever we were talking about the BMX facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| and things of that nature, I traveled out there to look, and I noticed that there was abundance of cars on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| I wasn't going at a peak hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| I was actually going during lunchtime, and I noticed that they were traveling at a little bit of a higher rate of speed than I would have thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| So what I did was I went back early in the morning, and then I went back again late at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| I went again on the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| I noticed the trend that I saw out there, so I actually called TDOT and met with them at the beginning of March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1064)|
| 0:17:53| and spoke with them about Chapman Highway and some of the plans they had to make it a safer route for everybody here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| I then asked them if they could come and give us, County Commission, a brief discussion on the plans that they saw best fit for Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1080)|
| 0:18:09| and then that actually got deferred to this meeting here in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Since then, I've talked to John Whited from the Knoxville Area Rescue Squad as well and also the Corcoran family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| and TDOT's been very kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| So at this time, if possible, I would like for TDOT to come down and approach the podium and begin your speech, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| I don't have a clicker, but I'm sure you can advance the slides for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1111)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you so much for having TDOT here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| My name is Nathan Vatter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| I'm the Region 1 Traffic Engineer for TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| I've worked for the department roughly 17 years, so we're very glad to be here to discuss safety projects we have underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1128)|
| 0:18:58| and just some crash data that we've assembled over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| With that said, we'll move to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| So the next slide, basically we've got several safety studies underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| If you look at the first header, and we'll get into each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| we have three spot improvements that we're actually constructing, a left turn lane along some segments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| So we'll talk about those projects that we have underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Also, we'll talk about a safety project that TDOT and the Governor's Highway Safety Office worked together on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| It's a 7.2-mile section in Sevier County, and how we got to that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| We'll also go through and look at the TDOT Improve Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| and also, more recently, the TPO and the City of Knoxville have consulted Kimberly Horn and Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1186)|
| 0:19:54| to study the section from Blunt Avenue to 168, stair at 168.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| So we'll talk about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| They do have a meeting tomorrow night at Southville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| I think it's the final public forum meeting, and it's from 5 to 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| and they've also posted the information they have available on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| So I wanted to share that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| With the next slide, just to talk about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1215)|
| 0:20:23| Yep, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| So the Improve Act, what the Improve Act is, is basically from State Route 33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| beginning at Blunt Avenue to Boyd's Creek Road, 338.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| The Improve Act was legislation passed for basically 962 projects that we had backlogged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| as potential projects for TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| So this project is $45 million to improve 10.28 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| Right now, we currently have that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| Before we can move that forward into preliminary engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| we have to complete what we call a technical report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| So that technical report is currently in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| so we'll be looking at safety and operational improvements as part of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| And that's, again, from Blunt Avenue to Boyd's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| So that's $45 million that TDOT has slated for improvements through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| We also have, like I said, those three spot widening projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| The first one, as you're traveling south, is from Hendron's Chapel to Simpson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| We actually submitted this project back in August of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| It's about a mile long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| It's currently in the right-of-way phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| We've got basically $8.8 million invested in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| $770,000 went towards preliminary engineering, and we had over $800,000 in right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1305)|
| 0:21:53| With this project, we're going to add a center turn lane with four 11-foot lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| a 12-foot center turn lane, three-foot paved shoulders and curb and gutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| and then another section we're going to have five-foot paved shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| But that's what we're working on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| From Evans Road to Burnett Lane, this is Knox and Blunt Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| We've got a section of road that's 0.9 miles long, also four-lane undivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| And, again, we submitted this one for funding back in December of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| So right now we're scheduled for a ladding in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| We're estimating the cost here to be about $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| This project will have four 11-foot lanes, a center turn lane, and three-foot paved shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| The last section we're looking at is from Macon Lane to Boyd's Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| In this project, we had an APR, advanced planning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| That's what we used to call the old technical reports, completed in November of 2002 for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| It's 1.2 miles long, again, adding a center turn lane through this segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| The construction cost alone was $12.9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| but by the time we added preliminary engineering right away for $3.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| the project actually cost around $17 million for a 1.2 miles long project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| So the projects we have underway with just these three widening projects is $32 million roughly for investment purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| The next slide, I want to tell you a little bit about how we, when we talk about safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| the Governor's Highway Safety Office, and I have a timeline I'll share with you a little bit later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| but they called us and basically said, we're having some fatal crashes along Chapman Highway and we'd like to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| We said, great, come, and we scheduled a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Before the meeting, we actually pulled together crash reports, put together this fatal crash map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| and on the map you can see there's a lot of different information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| With using GIS, you can actually put information on maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| which is very good at trying to look and see where you can best put your resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| So in the map, we've got four-lane undivided sections, we've got five-lane sections with two left turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| and the red dots represent fatal crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| And we typically look at a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| However, we knew Chapman Highway has a long history of fatal crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| and statistically over time, the volumes have remained, you know, they go up and down, up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| The geometrics and conditions, a lot of the site conditions have remained the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| So we thought it was a good thing to look at a long-term project or long-term crash history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| And if you look at that, Chapman Highway is also, it serves a lot of different purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| So when I lived in school, I traveled across to Bilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Now it's, I don't know, it's probably not even there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| It was Food City, but I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| And so that's how I knew Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| And if you talk to local people, that's what they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| But originally, you know, Chapman Highway is 24 miles long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| It's a regional corridor for a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| When it was first built in the 20s, it was actually the gateway to the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| So it's 24 miles long, and this segment, this map shows the whole entire segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| And you can also see on the map, there's, if you've got the handout, there's small numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| and that's the average daily traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| So the traffic varies along the route, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| So there's some sections that range from 12,000 vehicles a day up to 30,000 and 40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| depending on where you're at and what time of year and what year it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Because we've had also a lot of changes in land use along the route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Badger's Hospital has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Now we have additions coming back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| So you can see it ranges in the populated areas, and we'll show that a little bit later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| from 30,000 to 35,000 to 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| So the next slide was one that we submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| This is sort of a project summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| This is the 7.2-mile section, 8-mile segment, roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| that we looked at with the Governor's Highway Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| So when we looked at the fatal trends, we actually pulled each crash report and looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| and said, in our eyes, you know, sometimes the fatal crash may not have been preventable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| Sometimes it could have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| It's hard to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| But in this segment, we saw a lot of roadway departures, a lot of head-on crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| a lot of crashes where maybe there was one where somebody was trying to turn left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| and they got hit in the rear, pushing oncoming traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Another one where a young girl was 17 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| She was trying to turn left out of a side street and couldn't make the maneuver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| And so it was just made a bad decision and bad gap acceptance, and it didn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| So when we looked at this segment, there was a lot of crashes that we deemed that didn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| you know, didn't have roadside shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| We don't have a center turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| The volume is actually less, and it gave us some opportunities to do something less, using less lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| And we'll talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| So this gives the whole time frame, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| So from January 21, 2015, we had a series of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| and it shows each meeting with representatives, with the community, with county involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| And we completed a project in November 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| So within a short period, we delivered a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| But we know a center turn lane provides a buffer between opposing traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| a safe refuge for turning vehicles, reduces rear-end collisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| reduces delay for left-turning traffic, and also improves access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| My function in my office, we also issue commercial driveway permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| So many times we were getting a lot of people that wanted to come in and have a business out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| and we said, well, you're over the top of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| You're going to generate a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| You're going to need to build a left turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Well, that may have made the business cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| So now they have a center turn lane, and that facilitates also business activity, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| So there's a lot of benefits to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| So the next slide goes through the crashes that we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| So if you remember, too, when we talk about fatal crashes, we're talking about an occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| It doesn't mean how many people died in a single crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| So in this 7.2-mile segment, we had 14 fatal crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| One of those was a school bus van that crashed, and several people died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| So it's not just one person in that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| We also had 48 incapacitating injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| That means someone got hauled away in an ambulance, 200 roughly other injury crashes, and 685 other injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| When we look at the total crashes, it's not too bad, 685.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| What's bad is if you're involved in a crash, there's a 38 percent chance you were killed or seriously injured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| and that's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| So when we looked at it, there's something called the Highway Safety Manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| and it's basically a guide that looks at countermeasures to what you can do to prevent crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| So when we looked at that guide, adding a center turn lane can reduce the total crashes by up to 37 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| And when you add a paved shoulder, it can reduce the roadway departure-type crashes up to 47 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| And we have actually done studies to show what's been the effect of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| So one year after, we've actually reduced the total crashes by 28 percent, incapacitating crashes by 9 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| and minor injuries by 23 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| So the next slide shows you, it's basically an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| So since that 2010 to 2000, or 2000 to 2010, we did the fatal crash map then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| We thought it might be important to show this map just shows the fatal crashes since that study period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| So since that study period, we had 36 fatal crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| If you look at 47 over 10 years, it's 4.7 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| If you look at 36 over the time period, you're at 4.4 or so a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| So if we're looking at apple to apples, over four fatal crashes a year on Chapman Highway as a whole, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| which is, you know, it's not great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| And if you look, this map also outlines, it outlines in yellow, that's where the Improve Act project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| The blue, the heavy blue, starting from the left, is Henry's Chapel to Simpson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| That's the $9 million project we're targeting to add a center turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| For construction year right now, it's targeted for 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| The next blue box is Evans to Burnett Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| It's $6 million for 0.9 miles of widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Should be let in June if everything goes well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| And then the farthest right blue is the Macon Lane project to Boyce Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| It's a $17 million project that's currently under construction for 1.2 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Farther to the right, now this includes data from 2011 and 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| We'll note that our project for the seven-mile section included a lot of those red dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| And it was completed in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| So we're hopeful that we're going to have a greater benefit of reducing those red dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| We don't want to see the red dots on our maps anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| So that's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| All right, so next slide shows typically what happens when we look at safety crash data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| We want to look at the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| So we thought if we're really updating our crash data, we want to show you everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| But we also want to just share with you the most recent data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| And looking at the most recent three years of data, we've seen 12 fatal crashes in the entire segment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1903)|
| 0:31:52| 78 serious injury crashes, and 403 minor injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| And again, you can see where those are located at, where they're occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| within the project limits of those same projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| This map also shows yellow and orange dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Those are the injury and serious injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| So you can see on the 10-year, we didn't want to show that on the 10-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| because it's hard to tell exactly what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| But you can see it looking at a smaller time period here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| So we thought that might be important to see what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| The next slide, just to show you traffic volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| And this is from the TDOT traffic information we collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| So we're showing 35,000 vehicles a day up near the Henley Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| Down between Moody, just south of Moody, we're seeing about 30,940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| And then you get down south of 168, which is John Sevier Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| you're still seeing around 30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Our road dot area, where we did the rural road dot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| we changed the transformation of the road from four lanes undivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| to three lanes with a center turn lane with dedicated passing areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| That was our safety project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| You see 12,000 to 15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| When you start getting over 20,000, you're getting on the end of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| almost equivalent to the end of John Sevier close to Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| It starts to get more congested when you get in the 20,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| It really doesn't work well to reduce the lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| So just wanted to show you what we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| The next slide shows you just a little history of what we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| And you can see the volumes have fluctuated over the years near Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| Of course, we had Baptist Hospital at one point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| We've got some different development going on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| And with changes and different things we have going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| like Henley Bridge construction and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| you're going to see some different volumes over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| We have hovered around 30,000 to 40,000 in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| The next slide shows, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| so we have some significant redevelopment just south of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| just from some of the traffic impact studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Not the most recent, like the Kearns Bakery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| but just some redevelopment of the Baptist Hospital area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| We have apartments for students, apartments for non-students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| a general office, another general office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| And the trips that they're supposed to generate was a little over 6,000 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| So you see the volumes dip at times, but they're probably going to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| So just wanted to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| And the next slide just shows a couple of photos of some of those developments underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| And with that, I think that concludes our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| Can I ask a question for a point of clarification without going too deep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| On page three, it talks about $45 million and $32 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| Is the total project $45 million from Henley Street to Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| is that the total project period, or is that a $72, $77 million project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| So we have $32 million that we have underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| $2 million for that paving job for that eight miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| so that's $34 million plus another $45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| So it's on top of what's already been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| And that's the preliminary estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Sometimes those estimates do go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| In 2030, it will be a lot more when we build the road, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| That's what the IMPROVE Act had it slated for, was $45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| Okay, we've got a question from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| We all know that we've had a lot of meetings on Chapman Highway, Valley Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| to homeowners groups and everything, and I'm all for Chapman Highway being improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| Actually, I was very disappointed that from Madison Majestic Grove to Henry's Chapel is not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| So with these numbers, or these dates, started in August of 2013 and started in 2010 for these two sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2169)|
| 0:36:20| we're going to have a section from Henry's Chapel to the shopping center there at Majestic Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2180)|
| 0:36:28| Mountain Grove Shopping Center, where a gentleman passed away last week because of a drunk driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| We do have the IMPROVE Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| It goes from Blount Avenue to 338.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| One of my questions is when, and I couldn't get an answer for this one, so you may have to get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| From Mountain Grove to Henry's Chapel, that section that is very narrow right there, is there a scheduled date for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| So that technical report is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| We're hopeful that it will be completed before the end of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| and after the technical report is completed, we'll move forward with preliminary engineering for that whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| And that's up to seven years to complete, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| I was told by TDOT at one time that a project start date, the time it finishes, is about a seven-year project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| There is time if you have to buy right away, which a lot of Chapman Highway will have to buy right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| possibly move to utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| There is some time built in for that schedule, and then we fund each phase for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| So we are very thankful for the IMPROVE Act that we can get to these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| but there will be some time associated with getting to these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| I'm not a patient person either, and I would love to see this part of it finish up as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| And who knows, the other night it might have saved that young gentleman's life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| because right there it's just a double yellow, maybe a mid-turn lane, maybe we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| There's been three crashes there that are caused by deaths in the county portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| One was a medical, one was probably medical that was undetermined, and then last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| So the best thing that we could do for Chapman Highway at this point in time until we TDOT is slow down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2287)|
| 0:38:16| don't text, don't drive drunk, don't be eating your food, pay attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| and just because there's two lanes in front of me, or two spaces in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| don't mean one of them is for you to go over and weave in and out of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| We've got to start thinking safety on our own parts, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| One of the things I'd like to mention, too, is when we met with the Governor's Highway Safety Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| and we partnered with them, we were targeting the types of crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| and we had specifically addressed they added enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| The Governor's Highway Safety Office sponsored some specialized enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| and did some studies themselves to determine when best to put the enforcement out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| So that's something that's always important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| We can design roads the best we can, but we have to rely on others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| and sometimes the speeding, it is a factor, but it's something that we can address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| Yeah, one of the safest times on Chapman Highway was when the bridge was closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| because we had state troopers every two miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| So people slowed down, and that was the safest time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| And maybe that could be an answer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Maybe we can get with the State Trooper Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| and add more troopers there to slow these people down, and write tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| Just don't pull them over and give them warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Write them tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| And I appreciate everything you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| You've got a hard job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| I'll tell you real quickly, and I'll shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| I got to be on the bridge across the French Broad River on I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| I had to work on the bridge one time, and I was scared to death, the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| So I appreciate everything you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Commissioner Ailey, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Commissioner Biggs, I know your line had come on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| I'm not sure if you wanted to go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| but I also have two commissioners that have got questions that may be related to TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| Do you mind if we go ahead and move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| I have a quick question, too, but let them go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Does TDOT look at short-term safety efforts while you're doing these long-term plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| which I know take years and years and years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Are they also assessing smaller, more tangible, quicker items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| that might be able to improve safety, like the flexible center line dividers that you see around town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| or other sort of smaller things that can be done now while the rest of it is being caught up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| And if so, what are those recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| Like I said, if you look at that eight-mile segment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| we didn't have in our budget even resurfacing that segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| It would have cost an estimated $82 million to add a center turn lane through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| We weren't happy to wait, so we initiated that project, which was tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| We had to sell it to our commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| We had to sell it to our representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| We had to sell it to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I've worked for the department 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| I'll tell you, too, this is not the first time we've looked at low-cost things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| We've put in buffers in areas, just a buffer of spreading the yellow lines out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| making the lanes smaller to accommodate that, and putting in center line rumbles in areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| So we've done a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| The next thing, we've got to address some of these areas that don't have center turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| They create the buffer and the separation between traffic and storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| and that's a big focus for us, and having the recovery area outside the travel lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| So if somebody runs off the road, they have a recovery area to not run into a fixed object or culvert or ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| I'll ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| When we get down closer to the Henley Street Bridge, the traffic counts are in the 35,000 to 30,000 range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| but you said you did that traffic diet out in the Seymour area that's a much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| What is the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Because I can't imagine you doing a traffic diet, a lane diet, down from Henley Street to Stone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| We're seeing 30,000 from John Sevier up towards the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| The section we did, it ranged from 12,000 to 15,000 ADT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| So I guess my question is, is a lane diet at 30,000 cars a day, is that feasible or engineerable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2539)|
| 0:42:27| That's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Studies have shown you can do it up to in the 20s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| I'll tell you, a lot of folks are not really acceptable of that when you reach close to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| It just depends on what kind of level of service and delays you want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| We're worried about it pushing it out into the neighborhoods and the side roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| If you do a lane diet down through there, it's going to push it into the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| And so that was kind of my question, is we would have to start having discussions about what we do on the other side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Okay. Go ahead, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| If you were to number 47 fatalities in a 10-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| how would you characterize that number in comparison to, say, a similar highway of similar length and traffic volume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2593)|
| 0:43:24| It's higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| I mean, we don't want a single fatality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| It's a lot higher than what you should normally see on a similar type roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2610)|
| 0:43:39| We've looked at the three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| I'll just tell you, we looked at the three-year period just to look at fatals occurring versus a statewide average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| And from the Henley Bridge to 168, the fatals are twice what you should see from a statewide standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| If you look from 168 to Burnett Station, it's 2.03 times what you should see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| If you look from Burnett Station to 338, it dropped off in the most recent three-year period because we didn't have any, which we're very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2641)|
| 0:44:11| But it's not what we should be seeing as many as we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Nathan, I just want to take time to say thank you for what you've done for me out in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| and spending time with us and discussing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| And he can find solutions that will work and inexpensive and quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| I'm going to go back to Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| I know, Commissioner Biggs, I think you had a couple of different speakers that wanted to talk to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| and I've also had three people have expressed a desire to talk in public forum related to this particular topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Kind of tell me where you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Well, I actually had a question for Nathan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| So we have it on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I think at MPC last week it was deferred to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| But there's a 165-unit neighborhood that's proposing to go in off of Highland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| And I was trying to look on my map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Maybe Commissioner Daly can tell me a little bit better in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| Does Highland, that's a blind hill that comes over that right there in front of the Bower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| Is that Bower Field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| So in that specific area, what would you suggest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Because I don't know if that's on the plan for a turn lane or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| Plus, I really did want to thank you for this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| Very detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| And thank you and everyone for coming out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| I really do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| We do work with our planning partners when they're doing subdivisions and things like that to look at impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| It doesn't really have to tie to the state road to have impact to the state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| So we're always looking for turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| We are building a turn lane in the Highland View area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| That's the one that goes from Evans Road to Burnet Lane, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| So depending on where that falls in that area, it may have a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| And that's the one we're letting later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| So they may be taken care of, which would help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Mr. Chairman, I also have another speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| I was going to ask John Whitehead from the Knoxville Rescue Squad to come up and give us a brief description on some of the data he also has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Mr. Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| John Whitehead, Knox County Rescue, 512 North Joe Highway Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| She's going to pull the file up, and I also have some handouts for you if you want to take a look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| These numbers are a little more local, meaning that they were pulled from the Emergency 911 Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| They're broken down from inside the corporate city limits and outside the corporate city limits, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| So there is a margin of error with some of these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| But generally speaking, these start in January of 2018 and run up concurrent to today as far as numbers of reported motor vehicle crashes with injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2819)|
| 0:47:10| So there could be more crashes, and TDOT would have more data on that than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| But you can look at the chart there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| So quite a few numbers of wrecks with injuries reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| You can go ahead and change that slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| And then it talks about the volume comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| KFD, starting last year up until now, is 83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| Knox County Rescue and Seymour Volunteer Fire Department, 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2856)|
| 0:47:44| Percentage comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| And you all can read that as well as I can sit here and read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| The one map that I would like to get to on the next page, if you can pull that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2871)|
| 0:48:01| So this is an interactive map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| And if you will click inside the red box out beside Adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Commissioner Jay, what was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Before you go ahead, can I ask a question about the first two slides before you breeze on by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Are these charts in real time compared to, is this all of 28 compared to, it says year to date of 2019?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2901)|
| 0:48:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| And the same one on the second one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| I just want to make sure I clarified that because one looks like the crash data has gone way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Sorry about the interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| No, it's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| So this is an interactive map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| And if you click, it should be able to click inside those if you have a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| And it will plot each rec out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| You might be able to zoom in and help you some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2939)|
| 0:49:08| It's not connected to the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2948)|
| 0:49:23| So what this map does, and if she can get it connected to the Internet, that would be great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| it would be the next page for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| And if you see inside those red circles, red representing the Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| the green Seymour outside the corporate city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| And if she were able to get connected and pull that up, it would plot those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| So there's 30 in each one of those round circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| They don't represent the amount of damage to a car or to a person or the injury sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| What it represents is a call into the 911 center for a wreck with injuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| which would require a response by emergency medical and fire services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=2999)|
| 0:50:07| I wish I could get those pulled up because I believe I can pull it up on my computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| It's pretty detailed and it will plot each individual motor vehicle accident with injury out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3011)|
| 0:50:27| And then you can expand out on your next sheet or next slide if you can't get it to pull up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3027)|
| 0:50:40| Just so you know, Zach, our leader of Knox County IT is over here. He's on the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| I'm not the leader of IT. I have a guy that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| Zach is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3048)|
| 0:50:58| I'd like to have his password though, that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| Just click inside those boxes. It will plot. It will break it down. Just click again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3069)|
| 0:51:17| Oh, back out just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| The plus or minus. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Pull it out a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| All right, try the 12, second 12. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| Not sure why it's not plotting it. It should plot them out a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3092)|
| 0:51:41| See if you can pull out a little bit from the city. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3101)|
| 0:51:51| So generally this, before I came, it plotted those just fine, so I'm not sure if it's slow to pick them up or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3111)|
| 0:51:59| But it will plot each rec out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| You can back out a little bit and try some other ones further out in the county and see if it will pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3122)|
| 0:52:15| It's not picking them up for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| And that was going to be the highlight, but if you turn to the last page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| it will show you basically what the plotter looks like once you pull it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| and it works correctly on your last page of the report that I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| And it will plot each individual rec by its location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| And so we have the ability to pull these up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| and I can get you a way to be able to see that on your own time if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| or I can answer any questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| I would like to mention the gentleman killed last week was a longtime serving paramedic in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| And it's tragic when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| It's even more tragic when someone's serving our county residents that's highly skilled and proficient at what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| So it's tragic, and I know everybody grieves for him, and I just want to say a word specifically about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3184)|
| 0:53:13| Does anyone have any questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| I've got a request for the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Would you mind leaving a copy of your presentation, the digital version, for the county clerk's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| Sure, they can have the one I gave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Commissioner Daley has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Just for clarification, your percentage totals is the percentage of crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Reported crashes with injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| It's percentage of crashes, which is well over 600, 700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| Right, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| So we're talking in Knox County, Sevierville, Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| We're talking about 20%, and yours you get the calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| I just wanted to make sure that was clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| And I noticed, we've got breakouts in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| You've got both the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| You've got Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| We've got volunteer rescue squads out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| So it's broken down into two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| You have inside the corporate city limits, which is the Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| and then you have outside the corporate city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| which is served by the Seymour Volunteer Fire Department and Knox County Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| If we were to click on one of those dots that's got the green in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| would that break out the details on if it was Sevier County or the rescue squad or if it was the volunteer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| It would be combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Any call outside the corporate city limits would involve Knox County Rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| and the Seymour Volunteer Fire Department on each one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| What it will do, if you click inside that bubble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| is it will tell you the number of times we have run that same call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| So it may be a one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| So you may have ran to that same teardrop there three times to that one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| That is one thing it will pull when you click it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Do any of my fellow commissioners have any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| I really appreciate the data, and it definitely backs up a lot of the stuff that TDOT presented earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| And I did have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| On the majority of your crashes in the county, are they T-bones, head-ons, or the drops would basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3318)|
| 0:55:27| Well, I don't have the budget to pull those kinds of run data, but TDOT might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| But most severe crashes are head-on collisions or T-bone collisions where you have the most severe injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Thank you so much for coming, and I appreciate everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| Commissioner Biggs, I'm going to look back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Did you have any additional presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| I actually had somebody that dropped some stuff off for all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| It's D.J. and Wendy Corcoran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| I was going to give them a moment to speak and go over the data that they left us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you for letting me speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| I'm speaking on behalf of my husband, D.J., and my family and friends that have come to join us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| I'm here to speak for my youngest son, Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| Pierce was killed on December the 29th at 6.33 p.m. on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| He was hit head-on by someone without a driver's license or insurance who was in our country illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3380)|
| 0:56:28| For us, there are two issues, safety and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| First, there's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| We're not the first nor will we be the last to lose a loved one on a road known to many as dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| For many years, the residents of South Knoxville, Seymour, and Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| have pled with local officials to address the safety issues of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| Traffic volume, accidents, and fatalities have continued to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| There's no question Chapman Highway needs major improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| Could it be that the real solution to making a safer Chapman Highway is alleviating the traffic volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| by providing an alternate route, as TDOT studies have previously shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| and as city engineer Jim Hagerman endorsed in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| The man who killed our son gave an Oak Ridge address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| and likely wouldn't have taken Chapman Highway had he had an alternate route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| The young man also impacted the night was headed to the mountains for a family weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| Neither of these men were doing business or lived off Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3449)|
| 0:57:36| As our downtown thrives and we see more and more development coming to South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| we can only imagine the impact this will have on an already dangerous, congested stretch of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| We can only imagine what family is going to get the knock on the door we did just 15 weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3466)|
| 0:57:55| We are compelled to speak out to honor our son and to spare others this unspeakable pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3475)|
| 0:58:05| Why must we choose between an urban wilderness and James White Parkway extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| Why are we choosing to ignore or downplay the 77 lives lost on Chapman Highway since 2005?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| More development is underway which will undoubtedly bring more cars traveling on the same stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| where our son lost his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| Responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| It's the responsibility of each elected official to know the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| and seek the advice and recommendations of travel engineers, of traffic engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| when making decisions about road safety and improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| Recommendations of TDOT and the University of Tennessee were ignored in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| both stating the only solution to reducing the number of fatalities on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| was reducing traffic flow by completing an alternate route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| We are begging each of you to make this a priority and work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| We ask you to start the process by putting James White Parkway extension back on the TPO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| and allowing to conduct an unbiased study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| I want to leave you with Pierce's words written in his journal, found in his mangled car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| and my soul and my actions still matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Commissioners, mayors, TDOT, TPO representatives, your actions still matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| They matter to the citizens you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| They matter to our family who has paid too high a price to satisfy the wishes of a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| who love land over lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3579)|
| 0:59:50| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| Commissioner Biggs, was there anyone else that was on your list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| I just wanted to thank Wendy and DJ for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| No, I think that was public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| All right, I've got three folks who have expressed an interest in speaking to this on public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| and I told them at the beginning of the meeting I'd give them that chance at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| So the first, and the public forum rules apply, it will be a maximum of five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| First was Brenda Cunningham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3621)|
| 1:00:44| My name is Brenda Cunningham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| I live at 546 Man O' War Drive, like the horse, in Seymour, Tennessee, 37865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3646)|
| 1:00:54| Thank you for the opportunity to try and persuade you to give priority as to how dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3654)|
| 1:01:03| unsafe, and obsolete Chapman Highway is south of the Henley Street Bridge all the way to Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3663)|
| 1:01:12| I honestly cannot think of another highway like Chapman where every business has its own entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| on and off a highway that does not have a center turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| Can you imagine, I know all of you all aren't from South Knoxville or south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| but can you imagine if you were traveling on I-40 westbound and the car in front of you decided to turn left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3688)|
| 1:01:37| That's what Chapman Highway is like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| We need to put politics aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| We need to get all three counties involved, Knox, Blount, and Sevier, share Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| which makes it triply difficult to get anything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| At the same time, to try to implement a plan that makes sense, that literally saves lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3717)|
| 1:02:08| I'm a word person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| I love words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| I love jargon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| Each of you all have your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| County Commission speaks its jargon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| TDOT speaks its jargon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| But when they say the red dots represent fatal crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| it just breaks my heart because those red dots represent families changed forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3743)|
| 1:02:31| They don't represent fatal crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| They represent people who will never be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| And if you're one of them, you understand exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| And if you're not one of them, you talk about 11-foot wide lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| I'm asking you to see them as people and to let this be the time, this be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| Chapman is obsolete, antiquated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| There's places on it where you're going to have to fill in 100 feet to even think about a center lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| You're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| So anyway, I'm asking your cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| You all have some power in this, and I'm asking you to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| Next was Boyd Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| Is Mr. Jenkins here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Okay, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| My name is Boyd Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| I live at 135 Vanderview Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| If you could lean or pull the microphone down just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| My name is Boyd Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| I live at 135 Vanderview Drive, Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| My wife and I moved to Seymour in 72, so we have quite a history of driving on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3828)|
| 1:03:58| I was, whenever the James Parkway was taken off the construction list, I was very disappointed in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3838)|
| 1:04:08| because that, whenever the road was promised, three roads were promised to Knox County area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3848)|
| 1:04:17| when they had a gas tax increase in the late 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Pellissippi Parkway, Middlebrook Pikeway reconstruction, and the South Knoxville connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| Of course, James Parkway, as is later known, was partially completed and then it was stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3867)|
| 1:04:35| We have a problem with, as Mr. Hennigy from TDOT said in one of the meetings in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3875)|
| 1:04:43| Chapman Highway grades out as the lowest possible ranking in federal transportation guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3883)|
| 1:04:54| as far as being able to handle the traffic flow whenever you look at the traffic and the construction of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| It's an unlimited access road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| You can get off every 20 or 50 feet whenever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| No turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Whenever you start trying to put turn lanes from Henley Street Bridge to Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| to 441 Boyd's Creek Highway and widen the road to where it can accept that traffic flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3916)|
| 1:05:28| I think Mr. Hennigy said at that time it would take $200 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| Whenever James Parkway was taken off the construction list, the estimated cost was $104 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| I think probably 80% of that was federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3939)|
| 1:05:50| Commissioner Schroeder said you can't make Chapman Highway to the point where it can handle the traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3950)|
| 1:06:01| We've got new subdivisions going in Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| New subdivisions, one was mentioned about going in right off of Chapman Highway on Island View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3964)|
| 1:06:13| Apartment complexes behind Bayou Bay that just opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| The traffic flow, I looked at the TDOT traffic count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| and according to what I saw is kind of different figures from what the TDOT representative had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| They were showing 49,000 cars coming off the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| You still had 29,000 cars almost coming into Chapman on Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| So you have traffic flow that Chapman Highway can't handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| James Parkway would be one section of this to take it from where it is now to Johnsonville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| The second section needs to go from Johnsonville Highway to Boyd's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| We've got a lot of development on Boyd's Creek that has to be addressed at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| Whether it's in the next 10 years or the next 20 years, it will have to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| So I'm in favor of putting James Parkway back on the construction list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| to handle the traffic flow that we have now and what we're going to have in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| Next is Mr. Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| Mr. Chairman, I had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| I wanted to ask a question to TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| Is that for after public forum I do that or can I just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| Victor, would you concede public forum if Commissioner Biggs has a question for TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| Mr. Naney, I had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| Is there any study that shows the increase of traffic on John Sevier going to Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| or going to Alcoa Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Do we have any numbers showing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| I don't have that with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| If you wouldn't mind, just for the record, if you could approach the podium, please, with that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4094)|
| 1:08:23| There are some planning studies looking at John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| I think the county actually looked at that and initiated some studies with the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4106)|
| 1:08:34| I think the volumes have shown some increases, especially near Alcoa Highway on John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| and they range anywhere from 15,000 to 20,000, depending on where you are on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| So nothing on the opposing end of Asheville Highway or any changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| I was just trying to see where the traffic volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Near Asheville Highway on John Sevier, there's been more truck traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| It's heavy commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| I wouldn't want to quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| You can go to Tennessee TDOT traffic history, and it will bring up a GIS map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| and you can look at each dot represents a count station, and you can see the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| I'm sure it's grown, but I wouldn't know what that is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Stay right there if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| I see Commissioner Daley has his line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| He may have a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Clarification, Commissioner Biggs, the John Sevier Corridor study, they are the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| and I'll pull those numbers and send them to Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| And Drew will forward them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Okay, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| Victor Jernigan, 815 Sunnydale Road, Knoxville 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| And I'm speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| Chapman Highway is a self-limiting traffic road because it is the most deadly highway in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4193)|
| 1:10:02| The reason that it carries 30,000, 35,000 cars is because somebody dies on that road every 60 to 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4202)|
| 1:10:11| I'm asking for the commission to look at placing the James White Parkway back on the TPO agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4211)|
| 1:10:21| because it's the right thing to do to save lives, but more importantly for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| it is an economic miracle for South Knoxville and the city of Knoxville tax-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4228)|
| 1:10:36| Part of the problem with the growth in South Knoxville is that because one out of every three accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4236)|
| 1:10:44| on Chapman Highway is a death, people don't drive on that road at night and when it's bad weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| Chapman Highway is the only arterial major highway in the Knox metro area that is not parallel to an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4252)|
| 1:11:02| Kingston Pike has I-40. Broadway and Clinton Highway have I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| If you think in terms of the arguments for stopping the James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4268)|
| 1:11:16| that the city of Knoxville has continued to put forward, they are identical mirror image arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| to the same arguments that were put forward to try to stop the Pellissippi Parkway from being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| Can you imagine what kind of traffic would be on Alcoa Highway today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| if the Pellissippi Parkway had not been constructed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| Can you look at the economic growth that has been created because of the Pellissippi Parkway being built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4298)|
| 1:11:46| This problem that we run into is that people continue to look at numbers as if they're big numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4306)|
| 1:11:54| without looking at the relative value that's being created by the creation of a new road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| that moves more people faster and safer than Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| You hear a number of 105 million, 120 million, 130 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| So the project on the river where the city subsidized $40 million of construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| to build 330 luxury apartments, 450 beds for student housing, 2 motels and some restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4338)|
| 1:12:27| So let's put that into perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| $160 million built on the river within 800 feet of the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| and nobody can figure out how to build a beautiful highway through to Jefferson County, to Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| It is unimaginable the amount of land value that will be escalated by the creation of the original connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4363)|
| 1:12:52| which was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| So the original James White Parkway was going to come in where Yield Steakhouse is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| and then they revised it and they were going to take it all the way out to John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| for an intersection on John Sevier about 1,000 feet north of the intersection with Chapman Highway now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4386)|
| 1:13:13| A wonderful design. The corridor had already been planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| And yet, for whatever reason, the city decided to stop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| because it was going to damage or look to be damaging the hillsides of South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| for what would be an urban wilderness plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| I propose that the urban wilderness is a beautiful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| It certainly brings people in from all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| But what has happened now is that the city has created a meritocracy of people who can afford to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4417)|
| 1:13:46| in basically a park created by city taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| where you now have a dead end interstate system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| and a $10 million park that's planned where the James White Parkway should be continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| County residents are paying for those parks as well as city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| If the parkway were continued, TDOT is certainly capable of some of the most beautiful designs in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| I don't think the TDOT designers are any less capable than the ones in North Carolina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| who designed Interstate 40 to go through the Biltmore Forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| one of the most visited landmarks in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| So it doesn't seem to impede the people going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| It doesn't seem to impede the ability of the people to use that land area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| I am positive and confident TDOT can design something as equal or more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| than I-40 going through Biltmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| I strongly, strongly ask the commission to please place this back on the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| It's for the good of Knoxville economically and it is absolutely good for the safety of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| All right. Thank you, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| Go ahead, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Thank you. I just want to make sure tomorrow night, 5 o'clock, South Dome Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| there is a meeting there with TDOT. TDOT will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| This is the time that you need to come and voice your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| And if a lot of questions are created tomorrow night, let's have another TDOT meeting out in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| And they're very willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Every time we've asked them for information, they've become willing to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| We can have Senator Massey, who's on the Transportation Committee, we can get her to come and talk about TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| So tomorrow night, please come to South Dome Middle School from 5 to 6 tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| Commission, I don't know if we have the sun shining or not, but you're more than welcome to be there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| All right. Thank you. And Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Just a quick question for TDOT, if he wouldn't mind coming back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4551)|
| 1:16:05| When TDOT was instructed to stop the extension for James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| you all had already secured acreage for part of that project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4573)|
| 1:16:23| I'm going to defer to our director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4583)|
| 1:16:37| All right. So at the end of James White Parkway, there was a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| Yes. Steve Borden. I'm the Assistant Chief Engineer, Region 1 Director, Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| I live at 8212 Point View Lane, Corrigan, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| All right. So obviously when we built the section of James White Parkway that you see now that ends there at Moody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4613)|
| 1:17:02| during that time as part of that future interchange, half the interchange was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| At that time there was a section that was purchased during that project to complete the rest of the interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| with the intention of it would go forward from there. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| Was it like a mile long or just a couple acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| No, it's just a few. I can't remember the exact amount, but it's just a few acres at the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| It was enough to handle the ramps and the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Okay. But you never did any other acquisition all the way down then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| No. That was part of the study for the next phase was in that next environmental document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| Okay. And then you recently just conveyed those acres to the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| Thank you. My fellow commissioners, are there any other questions on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| Okay. All right. Seeing none, we'll move on to our next agenda item. Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4673)|
| 1:18:05| Mr. Chairman, Drew says you've got a couple more people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| Okay. Do we have some additional folks who signed up for public forum with Drusilla? Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| All right. If you could approach the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| as long as this is pertaining to the Chapman Highway. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4699)|
| 1:18:29| Hi. My name's Kelly DeLuca. I live at 716 Tipton Avenue, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| Thanks for the opportunity to talk to you tonight. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| My family and I have lived in South Knoxville right along Chapman Highway for almost 14 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| and I've lived in Knoxville all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| Sadly, the fact that Chapman Highway is a dangerous road is something that every Knoxvillian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| and Knox County resident just grows up knowing. It's just a given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| Another thing that every Knoxvillian realizes is that it's finally time to fix Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| As Mayor O'Hara reported in her interview with WBIR a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| 76 people have died on Chapman Highway since 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| and I personally feel like I see an accident on Chapman Highway at least once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| The good news is that laudable efforts to implement a strategy to improve Chapman Highway are already underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| The Transportation Planning Organization has been working with citizens since last summer to create that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| They formed a committee of community stakeholders that's made up of neighborhood leaders from neighborhoods along Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| and they've met with this committee to learn about Chapman Highway's biggest problems from those who use the highway the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4776)|
| 1:19:43| The TPO has also held several community workshops at which Knoxvillians can be updated on what the plan includes so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| and give their feedback and share their ideas about that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| It's already been mentioned that there's one being offered tomorrow evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| The TPO is making a commendable effort not only to improve the safety of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| but to do it in the most efficient and user-friendly way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| I can't speak for all of my neighbors or every Knoxvillian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| but I can tell you that every Knoxvillian I've spoken with is excited that something is finally being done about Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4811)|
| 1:20:19| I'm taking advantage of the opportunity to speak to you today in order to ask that you, the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| support these efforts that are currently underway to improve Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| and I would ask that any citizen who's interested in improving the safety of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| focus their energy on supporting these efforts that are currently underway rather than being distracted by any other dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4837)|
| 1:20:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| There was an additional person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| Sir, if you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| Ben Ream. I live at 510 Tipton Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| I've been a resident of South Knoxville for about five years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| and I would echo what Kelly said, that it's a dangerous place out on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| and it's wonderful to see the work that's being done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| But as a couple of commissioners have mentioned tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| there's not only the structural changes that are taking place that we need to focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| but also the thing that we can actually do right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| and the thing the commission can do right now to help improve Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| Commissioner Daley and Commissioner Biggs both mentioned speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| Commissioner Daley, you mentioned a bunch of other aberrant behaviors that people undertake on the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4893)|
| 1:21:40| Just given the number of people in the room tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| it doesn't take a statistician to know that some of us sped on the way here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| or some of us texted on the way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Some of us did other things that we knew we shouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| but we did because for some reason when we get in our cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| sometimes we think the laws just don't apply to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| That inevitably leads to tragedies of what happened to the Corcorans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| Wendy, I'm so very sorry for your loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| What I would propose and what I would suggest that the commission undertake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| as a way to do something short term, as Commissioner Jay suggested earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| is to launch some sort of public education campaign, enforcement campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4935)|
| 1:22:23| to go out and make people understand that you live in these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| you work in these neighborhoods, you live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Make it your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Don't wait for the TPO and everybody else to complete their work, which will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| But our own personal behavior, our own personal responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| is the only thing that we have any direct control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| and it's the thing that we can change tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| And it's to know that when we're going about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| when we're driving in our neighborhoods and we're driving along Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| and any street that we're driving on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| the most important thing we can do is to behave as the laws request us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| Maybe that means lowering the speed limit on Chapman Highway again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| Sometimes you have to go slower and arrive quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| It's a real simple concept, but it seems counterintuitive when you first hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| Also, that public information campaign could also be helpful to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| who maybe use Chapman Highway as an artery between Knox County and Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| to know that there is a much safer bypass that you can already use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| which is to go out I-40 and turn south down, somebody help me out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| the main road through Sevier County that goes into Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| That's the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| The bypass which already exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| which we don't have to wait around for some other road to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| we can use the one that exists now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| If we encourage people to take ownership and responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| for not only their own actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| but the safety of their loved ones and their neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| I believe that as Americans we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| Anyway, thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Is there anyone else from the public who wanted to speak on this subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5037)|
| 1:24:12| Sir, just state your name and address for the record, and you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| My name is James Hudson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| My address is 6016 Frontier Trail, Arrowhead Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| I've lived in south Knoxville since 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| The two highways that I use are Alcoa Highway and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| I don't drive much on Chapman Highway except on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| and I never turn left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| I've been to these meetings before where DTOC gives us a whole lot of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| about things they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| They're slow as molasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| When they were talking about Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| they said it's a severe church, severe Heights Baptist church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| They talked about slowing people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| The sheriff had been approached at that time, which was some years back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| stating that he would not allow his troopers in the morning from 7 to 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| or 4 to 6 in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| It was too dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| I don't know why we stopped the bridge to nowhere, but we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5116)|
| 1:25:24| I don't know if it can be reopened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| But I think it ought to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| There is some other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| If it's going to do what they're talking about on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| it will be 20 years before it's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| And there will be some more people hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| And so I urge that we might consider the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| And that would be my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| Madam Clerk, I'd like to move on to the next item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| This is on page 3, item number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| including an agreement with the City of Knoxville for Knox County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5174)|

| 1:27:06| By the way, my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| before we get into discussion on this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| I want to let you know my plan is that we will have a brief break at 7 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| if that's the plan and then come back to our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| Motion to approve 206.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| There's a proper motion by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| Second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| Do we have our school superintendent here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| I was the one who actually pulled this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| So if John or Russ or our school superintendent is here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| I'd like to get a little bit more information about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| I know how important it is to have safety for the kids in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| And if you could come forward and give us a quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5263)|
| 1:27:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5274)|

| 1:27:59| The item in question is the COPS grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| and it's a federal grant that's administered by the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| and we're doing it in partnership with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| What it does is provides us some funds for training of school security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| as well as to buy some minor pieces of equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| some school campus-based radios, some computer equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| and also gives us some funds to look at some visitor control systems in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5305)|
| 1:28:33| Is this something that's going to benefit all the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| or is it focused on some training on a big level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| or is it focused on any particular schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| It will benefit all the schools in that the officers that are getting trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| and that will receive certain types of equipment will work in all of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| It could more broadly benefit all of the schools if we identify a visitor management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| that we want to implement system-wide, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5340)|

| 1:32:02| I'll be happy to give you all kind of a brief summary on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| This is actually a project we're working on in cooperation with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| You know, one of their goals, and I think is a very good goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| is to try to create access control along Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| You have a lot of at-grade intersections there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| They have, as part of the resurfacing effort last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| actually eliminated the left turns off of Centerpoint and into Centerpoint by constructing a median there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5545)|
| 1:32:33| What this project will do, and we're working with Todd Napier and the tenants in this particular park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| is to permanently close the entrance at Centerpoint and Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| and in doing so, installing a traffic signal at Centerpoint and Lovell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| because obviously now the traffic can go out either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| We want to make it convenient for them to go out only one direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| So we are working with Todd and concerns that the developments in the park have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| to alleviate those concerns and install a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| And these right-of-way tracks will be to construct a cul-de-sac at the end of Centerpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| adjacent to Pellissippi, and install a traffic signal at Centerpoint and Lovell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| to allow them safe egress onto Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| Thank you, Jim. Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| Quick question. Jim, will that light be, because it's right next to their exit ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| is there a way to signalize both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| We're looking at that, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| It is going to be, because you've got several signals in close proximity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| You've got the new signal at Yarnell and Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| You've got this signal that's proposed, and you've got the next one up at Schaefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| We haven't ruled that out yet, but we think we can make it work such that we can install the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| and it still progresses traffic-efficiently through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| But we are analyzing that as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| Does that meet up with the church over there? Does that meet up with their parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| It does not. They're all offset from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Once again, it's kind of an access management issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| Quite a few driveways on that busy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| Could we try to line those two up? I'll talk to them. I'll see what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| Is that Providence, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| That is one of our concerns because of the proximity of that ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| We are actually looking at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| I want to thank you for seeing some of that infrastructure going in out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| I remember last year, or maybe it was the year before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| when we approved some of the development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| One of the things that we said we would do as an engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| was put in this infrastructure that you had said when we discussed it at this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| when we approved the change in the zoning out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| I think it was about two years ago in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| No worries. That project, actually, we're in the completed survey and in design right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| for that Cherahale extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Cherahale extension. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| All right. This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Okay. It passes. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Item number 30 is authorizing the submission of an application for a litter and trash collecting grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5714)|
| 1:35:22| for fiscal year 2019 through 2020 from the Tennessee Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| And if said application is approved, authorizing Knox County to enter into a grant contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5727)|
| 1:35:34| for the acceptance of the grant award in the amount of $168,600, resolution 411.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5734)|
| 1:35:42| Okay. Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| I would like to send no recommendation because I don't know if Drew knew I got in touch with KKB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| and Alita will be here next Monday to give us a little update on what KKB's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| So, I'd like to send no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| Okay. We have a second. The motion was made by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| I think I heard Commissioner Smith make the second on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| Okay. Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| I know that Commissioner Daly has indicated she'll be here to provide more details next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| but while you're there, have you got a quick update for us, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| When I think of trash, I think of a trash pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| I think of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| But that's a good thing to be associated with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| But, anyhow, is this the discussion, something we'd like to table to next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| Or while he's here, if you've got a quick update for us, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Drew Thurman, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| I would just say it funds our litter program, not fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| There is a little bit of an additional appropriation for staff and supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| and this year we got a budget request for an additional van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| As you know, I've stood up here a few times and talked about how we had a real bad problem with laborers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| Thankfully, this body passed an increase in funding for us to have an additional set of paid laborers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5816)|
| 1:37:03| and we're seeing several of our partners have increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| whether it's the criminal court clerk or Sharm Allen or the DA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| or community alternatives to prison program, veterans court, recovery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| We've seen an increase in every day that we take crews out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| we have paid folks and community service laborers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| and that's allowing us to catch up and serve the constituents of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| By removing that litter that you might hear about, your constituents might email you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| they call the mayor's office, they call our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| and we're happy to say that nowadays if you call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| and you are complaining about a litter on the side of the road, on a county road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| we, within a few days, can get to that and meet that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| And so we are seeing our numbers with respect to this grant going back up to where we want them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| so like 1,000 miles a year cleaned and several tons of litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5880)|
| 1:38:10| up in the 100 tons of litter removed and several adopter groups serviced as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5890)|
| 1:38:18| Thank you. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair. We've been getting a grant like this in the past, have we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| So this is, like I said, it is a grant, but I would almost consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| the way the law is structured, it's almost an entitlement to counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| so it is something that we expect every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| If it went away, I don't know what we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| But the TDOT Highway Beautification Office makes this funding available for counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| and as I said, there is an additional appropriation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| so some counties do actually have to live on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| It's about $169,000 for our county, but it varies from county to county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| We actually have added, so it's a portion of our funding for the entire program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5940)|
| 1:39:07| so yes, it's a yearly thing, and we try to use the grant money first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5947)|
| 1:39:15| before we go to the county tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| But then there are some things like fuel or repairs of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| or purchasing of a vehicle that we might have to augment with tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| Is it something we have to apply for, or is it just automatically given to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| So this resolution, basically, someone wisely figured out it would make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| to go ahead and get the authorization to allow us to apply and receive the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| So I'm actually working on the draft of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| It will be due sometime in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| Now that you all passed this, it will be something that we can just get to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| and the law director's office and get those contracts signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| So you're basically approving the grant up to that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| I would say at budget time, if there's additional monies approved for the litter program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| we certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Thank you. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| True, what percent of your budget in solid waste is this for trash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| So the total budget is about $4.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| This litter grant is about $169,000, $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| By my calculations, we tend to put anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6029)|
| 1:40:37| For $4.3 million, I don't want to say it's minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6037)|
| 1:40:45| It's very needed. It's very appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| But in the grand scheme of things, it's not a large percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| But it's specifically for picking up roadside trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| It is for removing roadside litter, as well as 35% has to be spent on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6054)|
| 1:41:01| And that's where Commissioner Daley said he's asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| We actually contract that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| TDOT really encourages us to partner with our Keep America or Keep Tennessee Beautiful affiliates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6068)|
| 1:41:17| So about $59,000 of that is going directly towards outreach and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| specifically targeting litter and telling people they shouldn't litter because it's stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| So specifically, how will the other $102,000 be spent on roadside litter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| So my budget that I'm preparing for on the grant is 100% going to be on salary, staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| So that's where we'll go to that well and drain that down to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| And then after that, we may have to add some county tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| So my budget, I have two org codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| One is the grant, and we spend that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| And then after that, we'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| So I might buy trash bags, for example, from a different account of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| because we're going to use this grant to pay for the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| That's six full-time staff. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| And one thing I did, as you said, pick up, this is sort of a two-for-one resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| I appreciate adding that to give you authorization to apply for it and then to spend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| so you don't have to come back to us to get a separate resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| Let's see, is there any additional conversation on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Okay, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| On page seven, item number 39, is a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| consideration of a resolution removing Commissioner Evelyn Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| as a member of the Joint Education Committee, resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6165)|
| 1:42:54| Okay, is there a motion related to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| Okay, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| All right, there's a motion for approval from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| I make a substitute motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| There's a substitute motion on the floor to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| And there's a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Okay, so the motion before us is to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| That's been seconded by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| Okay, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| I see both Commissioner Jay, you brought this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| I'm going to allow Commissioner Jay to make a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| and I'm going to go ahead and allow, I see Commissioner Gill's light is on as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| so I'll get to you as soon as Commissioner Jay has made his statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| I have a quick statement to read to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| Members of the Commission, before you is a resolution that I feel is of the utmost importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| I'd like for it to be known that it was not my wish to file this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| but as co-chair of the Joint Education Committee, I feel it is necessary and appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| Please allow me a moment to explain my actions and thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| The Joint Education Committee is a very important and necessary element in the success of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| The sole purpose of the committee is to bring together members of both the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| and the Knox County Board of Education to build trust, tackle important issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| and work on a productive relationship that will ultimately lead to better outcomes for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| and for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| Recent reports of the lawsuit settlement related to the allegations of physical and mental abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| of an autistic student in which $100,000 of taxpayer money was paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| due in part to the actions of Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| have led me to believe that her continued membership on the Joint Education Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| would detract significantly from the effectiveness of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| I believe it would be extremely difficult for Commissioner Gill to remain impartial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| objective, and effective in working with the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| without some personal and professional conflicts of interest being an overwhelming factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| that would both detract from the committee and its members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| In summary, my goal is to co-chair a productive Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| In light of the circumstances, I simply feel it would be better to have another member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| of the Knox County Commission serve on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| I call on Commissioner Gill to resign her seat on the Joint Education Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| but if that is not something she wishes to do, I ask you as members of the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| to support the filed resolution so we can appoint another member of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| and continue our important work. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I'd like the Law Director to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| to just give a broad outline so that we can be on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| Then I'll make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| Thank you. Mr. Law Director, are you prepared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| In terms of the resolution being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| the commission under its authority has the power to remove people from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| but it only can do it for what we call good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| Good cause is a legal term whereby it has to be within the totality of the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| of what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| Good cause generally depends upon the ability to do an action or not do an action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6359)|
| 1:46:07| The allegations which the commissioners brought forth have never been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| they were not settled in this case for cause of the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| I can't get into the details of why the Law Director settled these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| other than it was in the best interest of the taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| it was in the best interest of the student that was involved in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| Sometimes you find cases where the law is in your favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| where the facts are in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| However, the witnesses may not be in your favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| and in the federal court the attorney fees are too tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| and the cost for experts is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| So I made a decision regarding that which was strictly a business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| In terms of the allegations in that complaint, they were never affirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6418)|
| 1:47:07| The state of Tennessee investigated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| You've received my letter to Mr. Covington as it relates to the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| And the commissioner was reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| Her license was suspended due to an allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| The state investigated that allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| The state reinstated her license and she was offered a job back in special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6445)|
| 1:47:32| So as far as having any substance to what happened in that lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| there is none against Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| If we look at every case that we have whereby a commissioner is involved in a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| many of you would find yourself in the same situation as Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| We have had lawsuits on more than one occasion whereby commissioners are named,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| both in their official and in their private capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| So for the lawsuit to be the leverage for removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6484)|
| 1:48:11| the question that should be asked is there facts to support the allegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| that her service would be inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| That would be the question that I would prefer that you answer in your deliberation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| rather than using the law director's decision as an answer in your deliberation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| because you don't know what the law director's deliberation and or decision is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| and the court has sealed those records where I'm not at liberty to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| what those decisions and deliberations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| I can only tell you what the state has investigated and found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| And that's what I've tried to do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| The rest of this is policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| And so I'm not going to get into your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| You are free to debate this any way you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| First of all, let me say, because the core tenets of any civil society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| begins with the tone and professional working relationship of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6552)|
| 1:49:19| You know, and I've been given an opportunity to make sure I respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| because this really has a lot to do with the fact that we must build the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| as a body in order to build a better county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| But I've had lots of levels of unprofessionalism hurled at me like you would not believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6574)|
| 1:49:42| It is unacceptable two years ago and it is unacceptable now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| I've never once, even when the employment decision was made, have been unprofessional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6587)|
| 1:49:55| This is about the capacity to build a better school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| and looking at the fact that 40% of our third grade students are on a reading grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6599)|
| 1:50:08| We must look at how we pay our teachers and build a school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| that is responsive to all of the needs of the children throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| So this is directed toward me, but I'm about the business of having an appropriate civil engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6619)|
| 1:50:27| that is sunshine under the law versus what I've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| It is simply unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| I'm here to make sure, because my behavior has demonstrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| since the moment the citizens of the first district elected me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| to serve the constituents and all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6654)|
| 1:51:01| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| I'm going to see if I can understand what the law director is telling us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| that no decision can be made here based upon guilt or innocence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| because we do not have purview to that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| No, the law director is saying that as far as the lawsuit is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| you have no information concerning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| As far as the investigation from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| there were three different bodies within the state that investigated him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| One was the licensure, where under allegations you have a license suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| The state reinstated that license because DCS did not prosecute or find any allegation to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6698)|
| 1:51:49| So I have two state agencies that are basically saying through their actions that the allegations are allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6709)|
| 1:51:59| I have the county board that looked and accepted those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| and reinstated the license to Ms. Gill and offered Ms. Gill a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| That's the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| The law suit is something completely different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| even though I know the facts in that it was based upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| I didn't base the decision totally on innocence or guilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| There is no guilt affirmed in our settlement, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Okay, there is no guilt affirmed in the investigation by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| The only other issues that arise, I think, may be policy issues at the school board level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6755)|
| 1:52:42| But Commissioner Gill went through an investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| just like someone at the sheriff's department on some kind of allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| Her license was suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| The state, not Knox County as you read in the paper, as it relates to the truth of the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| the state investigated that and the state came back with the recommendations to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6781)|
| 1:53:08| When I looked at Mr. Covington's thing, which he says he doesn't believe in writing, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6788)|
| 1:53:15| I looked at what the state said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| The county did not determine guilt or innocence, the state did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| and they reinstated her license, which they suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| They ordered the license to be reinstated at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| She was then offered a job back in special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| Those are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| I'm not trying to draw a conclusion to those facts for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| I'm stating those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| And Mr. Covington asked me to look into it in terms of an ouster suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| and there are no facts to support that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| I got all that the first time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| I'm trying to get to the point that you made about our power on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| Your power on this body relates to section 2.02i of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| You have the power to create a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| You have the power to put people on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| You have the power to remove people from that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| But the power to remove people from the committee shall be for cause, good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| Good cause is a legal term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| You have to weigh the facts of effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| or cause to whereby a person can or cannot do a duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| or for some reason a person has done something that would hinder them from effectively serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6861)|
| 1:54:30| My response back to the allegations made in the resolution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6870)|
| 1:54:37| the law settlement does not meet good cause standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| and there is nothing in the law settlement you know anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| So the other side, you have to look at the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| and deliberate the facts as to what really happened that's out here in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| And I tried to give you what I found in terms of an ouster suit related to the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| So I've laid the facts out as they are to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| But we settle lawsuits all the time that have no bearing on truth of the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6904)|
| 1:55:11| And in this particular case, I made the decision that for me to continue this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| it would be too expensive for experts for special ed and otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| And I had a witness who could possibly be a special ed student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6923)|
| 1:55:29| that I decided we were not going to put through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| and that it would be cost effective for the taxpayers not to spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| And if by chance we would have a jury verdict to any degree against us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6938)|
| 1:55:44| we would be facing attorney fees which would be tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| And no, it was not settled for $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| And I'm not at liberty to tell you what it was settled for because it's sealed by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| Whatever information any other people got, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| But I'm not at liberty to discuss that or anything else related to the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| I'm telling you the facts over here for an ouster suit that I inquired about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| and the state gave me the information I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| Commissioner Smith, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Okay. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| When I saw this item come up, a couple of things hit me and bothered me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| And one of the things that we have is we take an oath to this office that we will do our duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| And we swear to uphold the Constitution of the state, United States, and our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7001)|
| 1:56:49| But what we're trampling on here now is we're going to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| which will appear to the public where it's guilt or innocence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| Every person that's sitting on this dais has the right to their good name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| And now we're challenging the right of one of our commissioners' good name by bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7023)|
| 1:57:09| Is there any fact to support, has the commissioner been convicted of anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| Has she been reinstated and exonerated from the people that took her off her original job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7035)|
| 1:57:23| She's got a job now, but to her original job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| And now we're going to pass it on without recommendation to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| And we're going to discuss it, we're going to get in front of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| and we're going to maybe say some things that we shouldn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| But one thing I know, everybody on this committee has the right to their good name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| and you better have cause to challenge that good name because the Constitution affords that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7068)|
| 1:57:56| So make your decision, but we're going to pass it on next week and discuss it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| I do not see the logic in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| I do not understand why we want to challenge one of our basic rights to our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7084)|
| 1:58:12| And that's what I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| I know how I'm going to vote next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| I could have voted today on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| Yeah, I've debated to ask this question to Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| but the only thing that concerns me was that there was an allegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| and I'll use the word allegation, that there was a time card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| A time card signing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| There was an allegation that you signed out to go to at 12 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| and you left at 10 to go to some function or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| Is that true or not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| You don't have to answer if you don't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| but that concerns me that that's one of those allegations that is probably, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7135)|
| 1:59:01| I want an opportunity just to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| You don't have to answer if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| That's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| So let me address this this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7150)|
| 1:59:16| So if the law director gives me clearance to discuss an employment issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| that's what that becomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| So those allegations associated with the employment issue is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| The allegations against the case is something entirely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| So you might need to pose that question to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| You answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| I believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| Okay, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| I just want to say that this resolution is about effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7187)|
| 1:59:52| The law director said, I quote, good cause or effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| This is about a committee within our governing body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| and about a membership on that committee of our governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| It's about effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| Anybody who's ever served on a board of directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| whether it be professional board of directors or a nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| or any other governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| there's a real basic tenet of every relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| which is trumped by conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| And that is something that everybody takes very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| Sometimes it's a legal conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| Sometimes that's a social conflict of interest or an action conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| But it's about effectiveness on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| I'm happy to amend the resolution to cite all sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| But Commissioner Gill, it's been reported time and again over a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| that within the Knox County school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| she was relieved of her duties as the school's cheerleading sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| for mismanagement of the program's finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| and taking the squad to camp without a proper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| She was neglected in her students' responsibilities to attend commission events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| She was reported that she mistreated a teacher's assistance to the point of quitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| It was also reported that she was disciplined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| for not properly outlining safety procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| and for talking to the students in a peer-to-peer way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| It was also reported in 2016, you know, by a South Doyle principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| a situation where she undermined a fellow teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| Time and again, time and again, there has been a very, very strained relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| And now this is one additional element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| And so when I look at the Joint Education Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| I look at the effectiveness of our committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| the representatives of this body sitting down with the school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| and I ask how in the world could Commissioner Gill have an impartial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| unbiased, and effective relationship across the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| with a very important part of our county having all of that history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| I'm not here to litigate whether it's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| I'm not here to litigate the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| I'm not here to talk about anything that relates to the legality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| I'm talking about the effectiveness of our county commission members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| on a committee that is focused on better education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| I think the professional thing to do would have been the starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| of this entire conversation, which was to gracefully say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| I put the professional committee and the education system first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| step aside, allow somebody else to sit there and in that seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| and have the ability to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| That was not obtained, and so the only choice is to file the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| So this isn't about good name, this isn't about legal issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| this is about the effectiveness of a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| and I think that my resolution and the facts or the statements in this session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| have shown good cause and effectiveness to have somebody who I don't feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| can be effective on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| I've got a live from Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| You can see now the law director has to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| So you disclose public information of an employment concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| and complaint with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| It is simply unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| These are all publicly reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| It is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| These are all publicly reported items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| It is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| It is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| I worked 15-plus years as a special ed teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| and any record of my employment is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| So whatever employment concern that I had with the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| is that employment concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| And even when those nasty allegations were hurled at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| I was still professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| I got 20-plus years of experience as an educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| probably more than anybody around this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| It is unacceptable that you decide that you want to recite those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| to try to prove your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| It's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| I had this conversation with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| It's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| Thank you, Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7440)|
| 2:04:06| It's passed with no recommendation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| Just on the floor, there's not been a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| The problem with it is we're getting to the point now that we shouldn't be at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7454)|
| 2:04:21| because now we're getting down and getting into personalities, not fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| like the law director said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| We're trying to judge somebody's psychological,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| which I'm not a doctorate of psychology to understand these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| But the main issue here is everybody has the right to their good name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| instead of bringing it before the public and discussing it like we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| And I'm uneasy being part of this, what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7487)|
| 2:04:55| And that's what concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| If we made a motion to go on and we seconded it, we discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| we took care of it, but we made a motion to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7509)|
| 2:05:18| I was looking this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| I wasn't sure whose light came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| But I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Just a point of parliamentary procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| If this substitute motion does not carry, this will not be discussed next week, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7529)|
| 2:05:37| I think it would revert back to the original motion, which was for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7537)|
| 2:05:42| Which received no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| Actually, it never had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| It did not have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| If it went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| So the motion before us is the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| That is the motion that is before us with the first and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| So if it fails, this will not be discussed next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| and it will not be on the agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| Unless somebody wanted to amend that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Or is it dead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| It's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Explain this carefully again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| You've got to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| Commissioner Gale, you're at light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| If you all could, parliamentary, Mr. Law Director, could you clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| You currently have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| If the substitute motion fails, it goes back to the original motion made by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7577)|
| 2:06:24| You have a chance at that point to have another substitute motion or vote on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| But it will not go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| If it fails to go without recommendation, then it will not go without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| It will either fail or go on consent, most likely, however you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7595)|
| 2:06:42| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| If it fails, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| It won't go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| If you pass the original motion, then it's basically on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| So that's where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| No, consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| I don't have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| The official, Commissioner Jay's didn't get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| Commissioner Anders made a substitute motion, and it did get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7621)|
| 2:07:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| I've got a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| Wait a minute there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| We have an original motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| With no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| Before a second came in, there was a, we had an original motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| As we were looking to see if there would be a second, Commissioner Anders made a substitute motion, which was then seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7639)|
| 2:07:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| Then in that case, you have a primary motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| If the primary motion fails, then there is no original motion to go back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7648)|
| 2:07:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| It would be, you don't have an original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| I've got a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| No second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| I've got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Mr. Law Director, I've got more of just a question about, you know, we had allegations that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7668)|
| 2:07:58| based on the Department of Children's Services, and the law enforcement side of it found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| did not make a recommendation, or did not find a findings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7683)|
| 2:08:11| You've got a civil case that then came forward that we've settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| Is there a different, not a lawyer, my wife is an agriculture lawyer, but is there a different, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7695)|
| 2:08:22| burden of proof for civil cases versus criminal cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| Is that, if you could clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| You have one that is beyond a reasonable doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| You have one that's clear and convincing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| You have one that's preponderance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| We never got to any of those because there was no indictment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| The thing is, it was, when there's no indictment, an indictment is, is it more likely than not that something occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7726)|
| 2:08:56| Is it more likely than not that the accused did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| That's almost, you know, the old saying goes, you can indict a sandwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7739)|
| 2:09:05| Once the investigation was done by the state, they said that there was nothing to go forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7745)|
| 2:09:14| So you don't have a preponderance or beyond a clear, or clear and convincing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| They have no evidence to go forward in their finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| So it's like, you know, there's nothing, there's no facts to take a case forward on when they have exonerated someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7764)|
| 2:09:34| And when they ordered the reinstatement of the license, that was an acceptance by the Department of Education to that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7774)|
| 2:09:41| When Knox County offered another job, that was an exoneration and acceptance of that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| And so there will not be, and then when I had to look at it, and I was looking at the violation of a penal statute with moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7788)|
| 2:09:57| Well, there's no violation because there's no indictment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| There's no indictment because there's no facts to support an indictment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| Because DCS investigated it, they will not turn over their investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| This child's life is sealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| But in the actions of the state, the old saying goes, it went no further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7811)|
| 2:10:18| And they reinstated the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| And they offered Commissioner Gill a job back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| Those are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| And those are the facts that I used in the determination of the letter that I wrote back to Mr. Covington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| He stated in the paper he did not like my response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| And that he was going to write the Department of Justice because he didn't think I told the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7837)|
| 2:10:44| However, his letter went to the Department of Justice on April the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| And I mailed my letter to him on April the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| So he already had his mind made up what he was going to do regardless of what we said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| because he didn't know what we were going to say exactly and how we were going to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7858)|
| 2:11:03| And he had already written the Department of Justice and the Division of Civil Rights with his opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| that we weren't going to make him happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| And in that, we probably didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| But we looked at that issue based upon the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| And all I was saying to you is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| If you're looking to the lawsuit as a fact for good cause, the lawsuit brings you no good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7881)|
| 2:11:30| I can tell you that. I can advise you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| Because there's nothing in that lawsuit that gives you cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| The cause that the Commissioner is wanting to bring forward is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| is there good cause that would impede someone from doing their job as a Commissioner on a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7901)|
| 2:11:51| And what are the facts that would show that to be true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| That's what you have to weigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| And that's what he's trying to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| And those facts would have to be legally affirmed in such a way to be good cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7921)|
| 2:12:08| which is more than just a feeling or more than just, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| It has to be, are you ineffective on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| And the question's been, this lawsuit's been going on for a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| I don't know how long she's been on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| I don't know whether she's been effective on the board or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| I can attest to that. That's not my bailiwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| I'm just saying that the facts, if you're using what the Law Director did as a relevant fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7950)|
| 2:12:37| it is not relevant to what you're doing because there are no facts to substantiate how she serves on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7957)|
| 2:12:45| And the fact that this case was settled does not reflect darkly upon the Commissioner in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7965)|
| 2:12:54| or the Superintendent, or the Principal, or Knox County, who were all named in that suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| I settled that case for all of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| So that's what I was trying to get you to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| and I'm not at liberty to talk about what I wish I could tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| but I'm trying to tell you through the facts as it relates to Commissioner Gill in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7991)|
| 2:13:18| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| Chairman, do you mind if I just read the paragraph in the actual resolution that I think is applicable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=7999)|
| 2:13:26| Okay. I'll let you. I think I had two lights that came on that wanted to speak right before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8006)|
| 2:13:33| I'll go ahead and let Commissioner Gill go first, Biggs, and then I'll let you read that paragraph, if that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8013)|
| 2:13:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| And let me say, because we really do now have legal issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| we're bringing employment-related issues to this Commission body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| with additional opportunities to discuss what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| We now really do have additional issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8036)|
| 2:14:04| All right. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| I have a quick question to Law Director Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| So you said that Mr. Covington went ahead and filed a letter to the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8051)|
| 2:14:21| on April the 9th he filed it, it sent it, or it got delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| The letter that he submitted to the Department of Justice was dated and written April the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| Okay. I was just wondering, basically, so he wouldn't have been happy with –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8072)|
| 2:14:38| I don't know because I didn't finish my letter to him until April the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| and we mailed it U.S. Mail the evening of April the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| He had already sent his to the Department of Justice before he ever could have possibly gotten mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8087)|
| 2:14:53| So when Mr. Covington mailed the letter on April the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8093)|
| 2:14:58| I'm trying to figure out because I –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| The reason I'm trying to figure out if he wouldn't have been happy with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| no matter what the investigation was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| because if he may have gotten wind that it wasn't going to go his way previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| He probably got wind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| but the problem is he was talking about the truthfulness of the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| without reading what the law director's office said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| Okay. So you didn't speak to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| Oh, yeah. I've talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| I've talked to other people about what the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| Like I'm talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| But I didn't speak to him in the facts like I gave them to him in the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| which was he accused Knox County of not being truthful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8133)|
| 2:15:39| Knox County didn't make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| The state of Tennessee made these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| And it was –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| I was not happy that he was making allegations against the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| with the law director and this office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| on decisions that Knox County had done in our investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| when the investigation was done by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| It's a state school, a state employee, a state issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| and they came back and said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| And all I was doing was say there is no penalty for a violation of a penal code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8172)|
| 2:16:19| involving moral turpitude because the state said so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| And then he comes to me and tries to impugn my office and my name in the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8183)|
| 2:16:31| and says already sent a letter to DOJ on April the 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| when I haven't even mailed him the letter until the evening of April the 10th, U.S. mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| So he doesn't know what I actually was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| I can tell you what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| Just like I'm telling you now, I'm trying to stay out of the middle of your policy decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| but I'm trying to let you know that this case is not a fact to base it upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| And here's the facts that may or may not have had a bearing in the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| and what I was trying to say to you from the case's standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| and there are oftentimes many cases, and I had a chancellor tell me this once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8225)|
| 2:17:10| He said, Bud, the law is in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| The facts are in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| You're going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| And I went, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| And he said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| And you know, he was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| It's not this case, but he was right because witnesses were not in my favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8242)|
| 2:17:27| They, number one, don't perform well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| or number two, if you can imagine where I would have been with this young man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| and the case before a jury and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| it just wasn't going to be good for the taxpayers of Knox County, even if we're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| I was just trying to see if there was correspondence between you and Mr. Covington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| before he sent the letter or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| That was my only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| Well, he had the general idea he wasn't going to be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| He had talked to me over the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| but I didn't go into details like I'm going with you all right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| I want to just point out two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| First of all, Mr. Covington's letter, his information, his letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| his presentation, and his interaction with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| has nothing to do with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| I haven't had any conversations with Mr. Covington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| don't know what he's doing, got the same information everybody else has got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| but it has nothing to do with the resolution before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| Anything I mentioned today was published in the public media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| I have no other IHR-related information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| HR-related knowledge, no other information at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| simply reciting the facts that have been out in published media time and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| time and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| The resolution before you, and I'm picking up at the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| says, whereas in light of the settlement of the lawsuit in which Evelyn Gill was named,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8323)|
| 2:18:49| named has nothing to do with whether it was right or wrong or settled or anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8329)|
| 2:18:54| as a co-defendant, the co-chairs of the Joint Education Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| I am one of those, felt it would be difficult for Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8338)|
| 2:19:02| to remain objective and effective as a member of the Joint Education Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8342)|
| 2:19:08| and requested that Commissioner Gill resign as a member of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| And whereas she did not resign from that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| we are then requesting, and it goes on for the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| this is not about legality, this is not about guilt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| this is not about a case, this is about running a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| with the Joint Education Committee and with members of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| to build an effective relationship of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| So if you don't think Commissioner Gill has done anything at all to warrant any of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| if you don't think she has a conflict of interest, if you don't think she can be unbiased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| if you think she can be unbiased, effective, impartial, and sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| and do great things for our committee and for our school district, then by God, vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8388)|
| 2:19:54| But I'm trying to run a committee in which we build some trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| and we move forward in a productive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| And I'm simply asking that somebody that might not have as many things as stress points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8400)|
| 2:20:06| with the other people across the table might sit there and help our education system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| work on a productive outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| This has nothing to do with any other case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| It's simply a committee structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8415)|
| 2:20:18| And it simply says it's about being named and having this as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8418)|
| 2:20:24| that really hangs a cloud over every proceeding going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| As I stated before, I didn't feel comfortable, and we're sitting here talking this out amongst ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8433)|
| 2:20:44| and we need to look at the facts, as the law director asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| Now, I've got to ask the law director one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| The statements that were made here, and as Commissioner Gill has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8452)|
| 2:20:58| was that public record about those actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| Were they leaked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| And was there any liability that's going to hit us because they were restated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8465)|
| 2:21:12| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| Well, that's not a legal question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| The truth of the matter is I have to defend this body, whatever you do, and I'm going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| The question before you is the commissioners presented you a position for you to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8482)|
| 2:21:29| I was just saying that in that position a lawsuit was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| and I was trying to clarify what the lawsuit actually did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8494)|
| 2:21:43| What happens in committee meetings, what you all feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| Well, the good cause standard is in the totality of the circumstances being presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8506)|
| 2:21:53| It is a legal issue that you have to determine what good cause is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| and one of the things is does it affect the standard of whereby one can perform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8519)|
| 2:22:07| And it's not just I feel like it or not feel like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| You have to have facts that show someone is not performing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8530)|
| 2:22:16| and we have a commissioner who has brought this before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| You have to weigh the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| You have to determine what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| You define what good cause is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| I don't define what good cause is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| I'm just telling you what it means, and does it apply to these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8548)|
| 2:22:35| But if you're basing it on hearsay, things that you read in the paper, that someone has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8555)|
| 2:22:43| the question is is the behavior in the committee effective or not effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| and what are the facts that support that, and are those facts enough to give you good cause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| That's what you all have to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| I'm not into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| I just had a little heartburn when we keep referring back to a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8578)|
| 2:23:04| that more than one person was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| She was named, but she was not the only person named,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| and it was settled and it wasn't settled totally based upon her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| It was based upon Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8594)|
| 2:23:15| It was based upon the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| It was based upon the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| It was based upon the witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| It was based upon the plaintiff is how this thing came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8600)|
| 2:23:26| People ask why, I think some person I can't remember asked me the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| why we didn't answer the claim or the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8611)|
| 2:23:36| Well, that's because they don't understand legal procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| and their legal abilities are not very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| But when you file a complaint, you can have motions which we file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| Once you file motions, you don't have to answer a complaint until the motions are dealt upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| But before the motions were dealt upon, the court ordered mediation, required mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8634)|
| 2:24:00| We went into mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| We found a way to get out cheaper than it would cost me to go on in trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| and that was the end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| That's why we got out, for the interest of the plaintiff and for the interest of the defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| That has nothing to do with service on a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| any more than Bob Thomas's ability to be superintendent, he was named,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8658)|
| 2:24:22| or the principal to be a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8662)|
| 2:24:25| That's all I was trying to say earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| and there's nothing in that complaint that condemns any named party in that complaint for my settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8667)|
| 2:24:35| because I don't want to be part of someone removed or not removed from a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8675)|
| 2:24:40| on actions that I did that has nothing to do with the substance of the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8680)|
| 2:24:45| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| You all do what you need to do based upon the ability and the questions before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8687)|
| 2:24:53| but the settlement thing is not one that I think you should hang your hat on for good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8693)|
| 2:25:01| That's just my opinion, but I'm not arguing your policy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8701)|
| 2:25:05| You all have to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| I still have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| So what you're saying, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| if we make a decision here, just like maybe in a court of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| we should have hard, tangible fact about the character of that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| if we're going to try to besmirch the name of that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| or challenge her right to her good name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| And if I've stated that correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| then we've got to look at what's written or what is hard, tangible fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8734)|
| 2:25:39| So, like I said, I know how I'm going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| I'm a member of the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| It's Commissioner Jay, myself, Commissioner Gill, and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| Those are the four that represent County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| We have four that represent our education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| Four of our school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| And the other co-chair with Commissioner Jay is District 1 Yvette Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8772)|
| 2:26:22| which is the school board rep with Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8782)|
| 2:26:30| All I've read is what I've seen in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| What I saw in the paper was a message from Yvette Satterfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8794)|
| 2:26:43| saying the same thing that Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| that she supported him doing the resolution, that she agreed with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8806)|
| 2:26:53| I also read where the chairman of our board of education, Terry Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| who is also here tonight, also agreed with it, that there was a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8819)|
| 2:27:07| I have had some people from District 1 call me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8827)|
| 2:27:16| You know, our responsibility is to the people, the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8836)|
| 2:27:26| And it is a very difficult situation. It's a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8846)|
| 2:27:32| This child that we've spoke about is a special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8852)|
| 2:27:39| I don't know any of the truth. I don't know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| All we know is what we've read in the paper or what our law director has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| What does concern me is what people are saying about Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8871)|
| 2:27:59| And whether it is a regular student or a special ed. student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8879)|
| 2:28:05| I am concerned about what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| And did anything happen? What was the evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| And we're being told here tonight, we'll never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| We don't know because this child was under 18 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8897)|
| 2:28:23| So we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| So, like I say, when something is dealing with a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8905)|
| 2:28:34| it's very heartbreaking and it's very emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8914)|
| 2:28:39| And to answer the questions of our people in Knox County as to what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8919)|
| 2:28:46| and to see, we know for a fact that Knox County settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8926)|
| 2:28:53| There was money paid out. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| There was $93,000 plus mediation fees plus court fees. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| I have a law director that's saying, well, no, that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8942)|
| 2:29:07| We don't know what the amount and we'll never know the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| My question is, is something had to have happened to have called in DCS somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8951)|
| 2:29:19| principal or whoever, or whoever was in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| If the allocations happened, was there an SRO officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8963)|
| 2:29:29| Was our Knox County Sheriff's Office called in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| What was the principal's remark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| I mean, we're talking about a serious situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| And I don't, I mean, you know, I know as far as Larson, Commissioner Jay's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8981)|
| 2:29:48| here we've gotten remarks from the paper about the ones that are on the Joint Education Committee with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8988)|
| 2:29:58| And so my heart goes out to Commissioner Gill also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=8998)|
| 2:30:03| All I want to do is to make the right decision, make the best decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9003)|
| 2:30:09| Since you know the facts and our law director knows the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| and nobody else in this room here knows the facts of what really happened and the truth, where are we at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9014)|
| 2:30:21| And I do know the Joint Education Committee is a very important committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9021)|
| 2:30:28| And so I know that these people have this feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| And so, Commissioner Gill, I guess my question is, I mean, it's going to be up to you to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9034)|
| 2:30:46| can you put all of it aside and not have hard feelings toward any of them that have voiced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9046)|
| 2:30:55| that they would like to see you resign or removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| And I guess that's my question, is there obviously is going to be a real, I guess, kind of elephant in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9058)|
| 2:31:08| or however we want to say it, because it has been quoted in the paper by some that they would like for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9068)|
| 2:31:16| So in order for us to move forward in a positive way, can you and the other ones put this aside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9076)|
| 2:31:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9088)|
| 2:31:29| I mean, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| Okay, hold on for just, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| Commissioner Carringer, you're good here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9095)|
| 2:31:36| Yeah, I mean, you know, we do know the county settled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| so there must have been something that took place or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| And I'm not saying I know what it is, but it is hard to make a decision not knowing what the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9103)|
| 2:31:57| But apparently there was something that happened or we wouldn't have paid out a penny for a settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9117)|
| 2:32:04| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| Commissioner Gill, if you want to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| I mean, I want to be clear as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| I'm trying to be a very even-handed person throughout this whole discussion that we're having tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9133)|
| 2:32:18| This is not the kind of thing I think that we all come here to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9138)|
| 2:32:24| I've spent ten years of my life working in the field of investigating child abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| and there's nothing that gets me more worked up than looking at a case involving the abuse of the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9148)|
| 2:32:35| But I also want to be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| One of the most important things through all this is to maintain the fact that we need to keep the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9157)|
| 2:32:43| It's all confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9163)|
| 2:32:44| It needs to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| And I do not want to do anything that would bring the kid or the family back into this discussion because that's under seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9166)|
| 2:32:57| And we do have, as the law department has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| there is a decision that was made by the Department of Children's Services after an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9180)|
| 2:33:06| We just don't know all the steps that went through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| Let him respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| I'll let the law department director respond to that, but I just want to make sure that we keep the kid out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9191)|
| 2:33:20| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| This resolution has nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| I never brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| I'm not referring to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| I think Commissioner Gill had just brought up the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| Can I just make one final statement and then I'll end my comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| The goal of this resolution, as it is written, is simply to ask this body to remove one commissioner from a committee and put another commissioner on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9217)|
| 2:33:51| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| It's not to besearch anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| It's not to litigate a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| It is simply to try to run a good and productive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9234)|
| 2:33:59| That is the point of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| It says nowhere in the resolution does it get into any of the details that we've been talking about for 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9241)|
| 2:34:07| Read the paragraph for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9251)|
| 2:34:12| Mr. Law Director, was Commissioner Gill named in the lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9252)|
| 2:34:21| Commissioner Gill was named in the lawsuit along with Knox County, along with the principal, along with the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9261)|
| 2:34:28| Okay, but Commissioner Gill was named in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| Is that yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9270)|
| 2:34:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| Of course she was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9273)|
| 2:34:34| Commissioner Gill is the only person of all the people you mentioned that serves on the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9274)|
| 2:34:38| This resolution is about the Joint Education Committee and the members on the Joint Education Committee only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9278)|
| 2:34:45| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9285)|
| 2:34:46| I believe with all of that I've stayed focused on, I've shown good cause and effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9286)|
| 2:34:54| I think I've shown good cause and effectiveness in that there's a major conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9294)|
| 2:35:00| And this is simply a request of this body to change spots on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9300)|
| 2:35:06| End of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| I've filed the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| I think I've made my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| I've not gotten into the weeds on all of the lawsuit and settlement and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| I hope it's up to you to decide what do we want as a productive relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| That's all this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| So prior to you actually even being a commissioner on this board, I was the chair of the Joint Education Committee in the middle of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9328)|
| 2:35:35| And my level of professionalism was just as resolute as it was two years ago as it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9335)|
| 2:35:45| So let me make sure I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| So if you need to sunshine a conversation with me versus having a conversation with your school board reps or Yvette Satterfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9348)|
| 2:35:57| or any other school board member over there to ask me a question about an employment decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9357)|
| 2:36:04| we could have happy to have had that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| But you didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| You didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| And you've hurled unbelievable, nasty language at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9373)|
| 2:36:22| And now we're going to have to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9382)|
| 2:36:25| See, this isn't about me being the effective commissioner I am because you won't silence my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9385)|
| 2:36:31| You won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| And the reality of this is the fact that we – this is akin to high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9393)|
| 2:36:39| I don't like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| You don't like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| We're all really now off into the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| I think the law director clearly identified what occurred that we're still not listening to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9405)|
| 2:36:53| And I'm going to ask him one more time to discuss what occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9413)|
| 2:37:00| Because Michelle had some outstanding questions that need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| And to really clarify one more time what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9425)|
| 2:37:13| Can I ask a question first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| But Skidmaker's light was on before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9437)|
| 2:37:18| But if it's pertaining to her comments, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| To Commissioner Gills, you chaired the education committee last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| When I first came on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| That was last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9449)|
| 2:37:30| Two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| Two years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| You were on it last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9453)|
| 2:37:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9454)|
| 2:37:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9455)|
| 2:37:36| Remember, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9456)|
| 2:37:37| Well, they didn't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9458)|
| 2:37:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9461)|
| 2:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| You had proposed a question to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| Go ahead, Bud, and then John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| Well, I keep saying the same thing over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9467)|
| 2:37:53| The facts that Commissioner Carringer, I think, wanted answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9473)|
| 2:38:00| The facts were that the state investigated the allegation of child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9480)|
| 2:38:06| They said there was nothing substantive to that allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9486)|
| 2:38:11| When you have an allegation that is brought for child abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9491)|
| 2:38:16| the statute says you shall turn it over to DCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| Whether it's real or whether it's memorex, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| You turn it over to DCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| So then an investigation starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| The state does that on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| The school's out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9508)|
| 2:38:29| The school's out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9509)|
| 2:38:30| The law director's out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9510)|
| 2:38:31| Everybody's out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9511)|
| 2:38:32| The state of Tennessee has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| The state of Tennessee comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| They will not give you the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| They will not tell you what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| They will not release the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| There's a child involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| But in so doing, they sent the message to say there's nothing substantive here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9523)|
| 2:38:51| because, number one, there is no indictment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| Number two, during this time that they were alleged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| your license as a teacher is suspended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| or if you're working with children, you're suspended from that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9540)|
| 2:39:04| The state board of education then reinstated those licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9544)|
| 2:39:09| based upon the investigation of the state, not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9549)|
| 2:39:16| The licenses were reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| And under all of the allegations related to that child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9558)|
| 2:39:23| they made a decision that she could go back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9563)|
| 2:39:28| Now, the statement, there must be something to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| because the law director settled a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| I made the statement that the law was in my favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| The facts are in my favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| The witnesses, however, involved a special child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| I didn't think it was in the best interest of Knox County or that child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9584)|
| 2:39:49| to go forward and hire the experts I would have to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9589)|
| 2:39:53| and do what it would take to get the law in my favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| the facts in my favor, and the jury in my favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| I thought it was in the best interest of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| for us to get this child some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| Let's get this thing off the table as cheap as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| cheaper than it may cost me to litigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| I made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| The merits are something else completely different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9616)|
| 2:40:19| that the state had already dealt with that I could use as proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9619)|
| 2:40:24| But I didn't go there because it would cost me more to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| and expose a greater risk to the taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| many times more than what I had to settle the case for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| If we lost one thing, the attorney fees could be four to five times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9636)|
| 2:40:40| what the case may have been settled for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| So I made that decision as a business decision for the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| And what I'm trying to get you all to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| that is not to be articulated into an assumption of any guilt or any activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9650)|
| 2:40:57| It was a business decision and a decision in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| to what I felt for the law director's office and that child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9660)|
| 2:41:06| because I know what it takes to defend a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9666)|
| 2:41:12| And it was better to go the way we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| than to go down the path of litigation on all the parties concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9675)|
| 2:41:20| especially Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| The facts are the state investigated, they reinstated licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9683)|
| 2:41:28| they did not indict, they found nothing relevant to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| It came back to Knox County and Knox County dealt with local policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| and local issues on anything beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| That's all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| And that's what I was trying to say to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| because this case was mentioned in the resolution, like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| And the inference was trying to be made that this case proved guilt, like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9710)|
| 2:41:56| And I'm saying that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| This case did not prove guilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| This case did not go forward for anything related to Ms. Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| Superintendent Thomas, or Principal Southville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| This case did not go forward because it was in the best interest of the child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| it was in the best interest of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| it's in the best interest of the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| That's why this case didn't go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| It was not to protect anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| It was a financial decision and a decision, what I felt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| was in the best interest of that special ed student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9748)|
| 2:42:31| not to have to go through a litigation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| I made that decision and that's the way that decision stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| It has nothing to do with what you're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| Whether she's effective or ineffective in this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| has nothing to do with this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| and this case shouldn't be inferred upon her effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| with a committee or not a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| or how people feel about her or like her or don't like her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9773)|
| 2:42:57| I would say the same thing about the other people named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9777)|
