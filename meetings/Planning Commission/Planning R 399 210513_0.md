| 0:06:48| provided by its Volunteer Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=408)|

| 0:06:54| And whereas Janice Toker joined the Planning Commission in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| and presided over the group as chair for the last two years of her service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| she dedicated hundreds of hours to monthly meetings over those eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=423)|

| 0:07:36| And whereas she has never been one to shy from challenging projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| her active participation in Nine Counties, One Vision, the South Waterfront Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| and Recode Knoxville are testaments to that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| And whereas Janice is a strong promoter of public engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| she made regular appearances at meetings for sector plan updates and even one-year plan updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| known by all as the most mundane of all public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| And whereas Janice always championed staff's expertise in the agency's work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| her dedication and support are missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=484)|

| 0:08:38| provided by the legal advice it receives, which was continued through the counsel of Steve Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| And whereas Steve Wise began serving as legal counsel to the Planning Commission in 1987,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| he worked successfully with six executive directors and nearly 100 commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=531)|

| 0:09:01| And whereas Steve was responsible for taking minutes at each month's agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| to keep himself awake and alert, he injected a healthy dose of humor and satire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| in response to long-winded staff reports and topics he found uninteresting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| His jest will be missed by all those he poked fun at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| And whereas he was supportive of staff's efforts to update processes and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| through his commitment to the updated subdivision regulations may have been what drove him to retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| And whereas Steve's obligations to other clients never stopped him from being available and responsive to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| helping them navigate through countless last-minute questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| and whereas his expertise and guidance enhanced the agency's work for more than three decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| Steve's contributions to planning have played a significant role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| in the respect staff and commissioners hold throughout the community, and he will be greatly missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| Now, therefore, be it resolved the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission and planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| express their gratitude for Steve Wise's contributions to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=594)|

| 0:10:46| to maintaining the unique character and natural beauty of our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=646)|

| 0:20:44| and what it can do to the buildings around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Will there be a meeting regarding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| There will not be a public meeting associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| There will not be a public meeting regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Well, there should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| because every building in that area that has built in recent times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| has built four to five feet above the current ground grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1265)|
| 0:21:14| And there's a creek right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| And as you well know, in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| there's major flooding in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| And if they build, if they raise the grade higher than what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| which they probably will do, then that's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| I hate to interrupt you, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| those are issues you can address those with the codes office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| You need to address those issues with the codes office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| The codes office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| This has already been approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| Well, I hope you, I certainly hope you looked at that before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| approved it, because it's a serious issue down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| There has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| City of Engineering has been involved in the review of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| I'd be happy to put you in touch with them if you want to talk more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| in detail about the requirements that they will have before they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| allowed to build on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| I mean, Firestone is right next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| and they get two feet of flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| And they're on the same plane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| and they're going to end up raising that grade level even higher than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| that, and it's going to be catastrophic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| We have already approved this item under consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| and no other discussion can be had by commission at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| The chair will recognize Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| Can we put him back on the agenda rather than discuss it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| I don't think he understood what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| I mean, we understand that this is their first time up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| I think we need to vote to put him back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| If we approve it, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| If we turn it down, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| But he deserves to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Procedurally, what we require is whoever is unanimous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| someone who would have to make a motion to rescind the vote on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| consent agenda have to be seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| It would have to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Then you could move to reapprove the consent agenda as read with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| deletion of item 44 and just redo that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| and that would put it back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| I'll make that motion that we rescind the vote, the consent vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| seconded by Commissioner Adams to rescind the vote on the consent on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| item number 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| Call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Commissioner Graf, are you all finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| My light is on regarding a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| We need to go back and get the consent approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| at least with the addition of 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| We need to approve consent with the addition of removing item 44 from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Eddie Smith, I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| seconded by Commissioner Roth to amend the consent list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| removing item 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Motion passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Sir, if you could take a seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| and you can come up when item 44 comes up on the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| Thank you, Mr. Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| I had a question about item 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| I thought that in the public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| there was a request for it to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| Did I miss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Can I ask you to kind of put your math down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| because I'm having difficulty understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Item 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| I thought in the public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| there was a request for it to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| The only person who can request postponement is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| Now, when that matter comes up on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| if a member of the public and the commission approves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| they can vote to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| But it doesn't automatically be postponed unless the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I thought it was their legal counsel that had submitted the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| but perhaps I got that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I believe it was the legal counsel for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Next item on the agenda is item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1538)|
| 0:25:54| Item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| The applicant is Richard Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| This is a right-of-way closure on Glenmore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| location between its southeast terminus at West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Binion Park and Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Postpone this request for 30 days to be heard at the June 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| 2021 Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| What number did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| You said 10 at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| What number is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| This is number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| This was removed off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| This is the one that was questioned because staff had recommended that it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| The applicant and staff both agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| And that's why it was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| We have a motion by Commissioner Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| second by Commissioner Korbelick to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| I'm the applicant for that, that y'all just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| And I was advised to postpone because for further commission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| discussion with engineering in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| but I wasn't actually for it until I was basically told if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| postpone it automatically be voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| So I'm agreed to postpone this 30 days to set up future meetings with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| engineering and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| They'll get this section, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| worked out because of the obvious lot of comments and emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=1644)|

| 0:34:15| Welch had these two parcels rezone to our two which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| afforded multifamily development in 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| He actually did develop a multifamily property on one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| the parcels on to 9 1 0 Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| The other parcel he does not have a current pre-existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| nonconforming use on when recode was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| He wanted to get this rezone back to a zoning that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| afford him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| To continue not only continue his multifamily but to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| to develop additional units on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| He initially saw it already in five as that was what he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| told to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| However that would require a sector plan amendment and a one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| So ultimately he went he went back at the advice of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| me and asked for our end for because that's consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| the the sector plan that is already in place for not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| this property but that entire block of properties there on on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Greenway and he did have to pay an application fee for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| because our end for was not considered a comparable zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| even though it does also allow for the consideration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| And that's ultimately all he wants is to be able to to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| develop this property for future multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| You know in the past years we've seen the demand for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| affordable housing in particular increased dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| This piece of property these two pieces of property are as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| well as the pro fly is about 10000 feet from the new Amazon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Center that's going in on the East Town Mall property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| So there's going to be a demand for affordable housing in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| particular area and there's no no real concern that the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| there on Greenway could not handle the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Staff's concerns it appears is that the multifamily would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| out of character with the other development in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| And I understand that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Mr. Welch's property is the only property there that does have current multifamily on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| However, he had the right to do so before, and as most people do that own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| he was waiting for the market conditions to be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| Steph made the point that if you take the total square footage of both of these parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| and in this analysis they were treating them as one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| They looked at the 4.1 acres, what they calculated as a total of 178,569 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| and then as a function of the minimum unit square footage of multifamily units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| said you can develop 89 units on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| I think that's a little bit aggressive and not realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| It doesn't take into account that these are actually two separate parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| It doesn't take into account the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| It certainly doesn't take into account the minimum parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| landscaping requirements that would be required for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| The minimum parking, according to the table of 11.2, is one to two spaces per dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| and another .2 spaces per dwelling unit for guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| So you're looking at up to possibly 100-some parkings there that would have to go on the property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| So we don't think 89 units is what's going to go on there or what could go on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| under any circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| But we're assuming for the sake of argument it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| All that is really academic because in the RN4 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| if you're going to develop anything greater than four dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| it's got to come back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| So if there's a concern about what could go on there being out of character with the neighborhood or too intense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| this body is going to have an opportunity through a special use permit to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| We talked about some of the grandfathering issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| and under the city right now, if you wanted to expand a pre-existing use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| you have to go through another public process, a BZA process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| and that's certainly not guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| What's there could continue, but if he wanted to change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| there's no guarantee that he could change that or expand it in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| and it would be constrained to the one single lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| When we did recode, we wanted to make sure that people had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| to make sure the property wasn't being downzoned, and that's what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| Now, I understand that the transition rules say you have the right to apply for a prior zoning equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| It doesn't mean you're entitled to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| But under these circumstances, I think Mr. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| who had to fight actually to get this property rezoned the first time back in 1984,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| is entitled to be able to continue to use this property consistent with the way he has had for the past 30-some years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| And under these circumstances, with the housing increases, the demand increasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| with this being an area that's going to grow with new development, new commercial development coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| You need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| And one thing that Council Member Welch pointed out that I did not realize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| she pointed out the fact that there's three churches in this area that cater to school-age children for home care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| and the like that's within walking distance of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| And so I think with all these considerations in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| it would be appropriate to respectfully reject staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| and go with what the applicant had before and allow this property to be zoned R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Ms. Porce, do you have any comments you'd like to make beyond what you addressed at the workshop on Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| No, we do recognize that the Amazon Center is going to be being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| and will introduce a need for housing, but that doesn't guarantee that middle housing goes everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| And we looked at the zone and we looked at the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| and we just feel like with the compatibility with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| the number of units that could be built, even if it's not 89,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| would still be excessive for whatever's in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| And so for that reason, we're recommending the R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| Thank you, Ms. Porce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| The Chair will recognize Ms. Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| I opposed this application when it first came through, and I will continue to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| I have four reasons for my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| The first one is that there is no other R and 4 in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| which I think would represent, at least for discussion, spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| The second is that R and 2 is compatible under the multifamily designation in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| so it would be as appropriate for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| The third is that the existing multifamily development can remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| and can continue to be maintained in a proper condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| He has gained what he was allowed with the original zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| And then finally, my fourth is to echo staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| The East Town Mall Center is going to generate a number of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| but I believe the city budget, which I think is still pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| has allocated several million dollars to Five Points to continue their affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| The Chair will recognize Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Ms. Porce, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| One, is this request from the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| is it actually a light equivalent request to what it was zoned prior to recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| Not technically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| So whenever the recode process was going on, there was a document that was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| that broke down what the zone it was and the zone that it was going to convert to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| And the R2 converted to the R and 5 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| So the R and 4 is a little bit new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| The intent of it is a little bit different from what the applicant has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| It's different from the area where the R and 4 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| So we didn't take it as a comparable request at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| We did acquiesce and return the fee because it does allow multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| but it's not technically a comparable zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| And R and 2 does not allow multifamily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| R and 2 allow single family and duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| The Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I think it's important that, and I believe what I see here is there's no perfect solution to this challenge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2544)|
| 0:42:33| But I think we need to have some historical context to RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| And my friend, Mr. Green, who I believe is here today, stood up before Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| and to garner some of Council's support on RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| he committed to what he deemed as zoning equivalency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| and equivalency meaning equal to value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| And I believe if you look at these two options that we have today in R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| and R and 4 to satisfy the multifamily component that he had prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| that R and 4 would be that zoning equivalency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| Although not perfect, neither is R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| That's why I'll likely land on the side of the prior commitment of zoning equivalency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Mr. Ooten, did you have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| No, but I'll go ahead and take it while I've got it on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| Can you bring up the sector plan, please, whoever's controlling this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2619)|
| 0:43:51| I think I remember some of this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| and I think I remember saying I could go either way with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| But the one thing that struck me as something that I could possibly tolerate was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2640)|
| 0:44:09| we talk about sector plans and zoning underlying sector plans all the time with residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| So if you're in the rural residential zone, you get one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| If you're in the LDR up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| and we talk about zoning and what you can do under sector plans all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| and trying not to move sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Well, here, this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| not only do you have Commissioner Hill's comments about equivalent zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| you also have a sector plan that accommodates the medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| And although there's not a lot around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| there's definitely some intent here of some transitional uses with this light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| and more of an intense use up against interstate and close to rail line and interstate access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| I mean, that's what this sector plan is telling me, based on my experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| So I would probably lean towards being okay with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2703)|
| 0:45:11| because of the sector plan and the equivalent zoning that Commissioner Hill made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| So I would make a motion to approve this zoning to R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2716)|
| 0:45:27| RN4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Per the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| I had a further discussion point if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Second, please, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| I want to recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| Yeah, I voted along with staff's recommendation for RN2 last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| and I'm probably going to do the same this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| You know, I agree it was zoned R2, but R2 doesn't only have high-density apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| It also has homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| R2 was a very broad zone that had residential single-family likes there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| and my concern is if it was the whole block that's right there in orange under MBR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| and it was an apartment development, then I would be more supportive of the RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| but these two lots are about 100 feet wide and they slope down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| and I just don't know that it's the appropriate size parcel in the middle of what it's in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| to do the higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| That's my gut feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| I think that RN2 is the right call here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| Chairman, I need to make sure that I clarify my motion to include the floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| and the hillside protection overlay on those two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| I simply wanted to state that my concern in identifying a smaller parcel as RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| might then attract more RN4 and would be really quite incompatible with the existing neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| and I believe the ultimate intention of the sector plan, which was low-density multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Right now we have a motion by Commissioner Uten, seconded by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| to approve rezoning to RN4, general residential neighborhood, F floodway on all properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| and HP hillside protection overlay on 3000 Greenway Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| I think we're going to have a split vote here, so I'll ask Mr. Wise to call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=2854)|

| 0:50:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| This is a rural residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| This would not fit in it because they're wanting to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| an alcohol and drug rehab center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| I talked to many, many people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| Only had one that agreed that it was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| We've got an elementary school probably within 300 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| We've got a high school within three-quarters of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| And we just don't feel that this would be a good fit for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| The applicant is not present, so staff, does anybody want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| I think actually the applicant may be participating online digitally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| I saw the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Hang on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| Mr. Vaughn, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| Yes, I believe there's Mr. Vaughn and Jennifer Moore-Pitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| Mr. Vaughn, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| You have your name and address, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| As I said last month, you know, we have this set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3111)|
| 0:51:59| so that a tenant can actually be a help to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| versus a hindrance to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| They have a ministry and a program put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| and they need zoning for the treatment piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| And the building that we own right next door is already zoned OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3142)|
| 0:52:31| It should not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| The only other thing that I'd have to add is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| the community needs more income and more help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| You had people dying under the bridge a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| You got people up and down the streets with drugs that need help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| and this group's willing to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| And that's the reason we leased it to them, in order to help the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| Do you have any other comments you'd like to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Mr. Vaughn, are you finished with your comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| I would like to ask one thing for the council personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| When you're having your sidebars, please mute your microphones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| because being remote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| I hear everybody's sidebar conversation overrunning the person that's speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| I have to disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| I don't think anybody's speaking on the commission side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| and there are no sidebars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| I was going to say, this was previously, it was picking everything up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Well, under Zoom, that can happen, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Yes, you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| The property next door he's talking about, it's a physical rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| It's like somebody gets hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| It's rehab for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| It doesn't have anything to do with drug or alcohol or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| Chair, recognize Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Yeah, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| I know we tried to talk about the zone that we're being faced with looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| not particularly the use here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Can you clarify, or can staff clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| do we have a use on review that's coming later after this office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| could get approved or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| I'm in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| If not, is this a permitting use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| Mr. Vaughn, if you could mute your audio, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| We're getting feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| The reason my question is, we just approved the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| Obviously, it suggests that office is a permitted use in this new overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| We just did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| If we're just looking at the office request, not the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| is there another use on review coming or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| That's correct for the use that they would be proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| This is just the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| I'm going to turn my light off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| but I'll go ahead and ask my question along the same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| I'm just going to ask Steve Wise to weigh in on what we should be looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| As opposed to use, we should be looking at the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| The use issue is a bit premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| That would come up in the use on review application at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| When you're contemplating the rezoning of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| you're not rezoning to a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| You're rezoning to all the potential uses that might be contained within the proposed zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| That's really the only way to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| The standard that you're trying to figure out is whether or not the proposed zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| and all the potential uses are in the best interest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| Yes, I think we're ready to take a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| I'll kick off by recommending denial of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| due because the entire sector plan has just been recommended for amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| and this would fall within that previous application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Chair will entertain Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| I think someone has their hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3401)|
| 0:56:50| We're already beyond that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| I'll do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Chair will entertain a motion to approve the OB office medical related services zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| because it is consistent with the adjacent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| I'd like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| We have a motion by Commissioner Korbelick, a second by Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| to approve motion on rezoning, first staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Mr. Sharp, what we're saying here is this does have to come back here to this commission for a review for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3464)|
| 0:57:54| So they'll have to put in a new application to come back in order to have the use that they're proposing approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3474)|
| 0:58:02| So you still have an opportunity as a community to have input on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| I hate to interject, but that will be occurring later in the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| So you need to stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Commissioner Phillips, that was automatically postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| That was postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Yeah, that was number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| Was that a 30-day automatic postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| So you'll need to come back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| Next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| It'll be on the agenda next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| Can we get a notice on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Next item is item number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3522)|

| 1:00:27| We deny CH1 General Commercial zoning request because it's not compatible with the surrounding neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3627)|

| 1:01:54| Parker Bartholomew, 816 Claybrook Court, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| The rezoning request of five units per acre is consistent with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| and the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Notably, the property directly to the south that used to be part of the Hatmaker Estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| as was my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| It was actually split off just a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| That rezoning request went through with less than five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| and there's a stream that runs through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| The property to the north is a group home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| When I started this process, I knew that the hillside protection calculation would be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| The property is in the planned growth area, and LDR provides for up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| The current stack recommendation is that the non-hillside be two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| I believe, based on the surrounding development and what has been approved the last couple months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| and over the last few years in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| that the appropriate non-hillside calculation needs to be five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| There currently is a postponed plan, rezoning plan, for the property just to the north of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3780)|
| 1:03:09| I also had a hillside calculation done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| In that hillside calculation, in which there's 70 percent of that property is slope and minus 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| the staff used four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| So when you use the five units per acre calculation on our non-hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| then it comes to a density of 4.33 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| and that's what I'm asking MPC to approve today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| A rezoning of 4.33 units per acre, which matches up with the hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| using five as the non-sloped area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| There is no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Ms. Albertson, staff on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| So staff is making a density recommendation based on a number of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| Although there is up to five dwelling units per acre that was approved across the street from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| this property is a little bit more slope constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| Henderson Road also in this area is a little bit more of a smaller road than Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| that the other property is adjacent to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| So it's not just the slope analysis that staff looks at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| but that is one of the factors in this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| So we are recommending 1.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| You can see the slopes on the property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| Thank you, Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| In our slope calculations, don't we already use five units an acre on zero to 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| Not always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| No, we look at what the surrounding density is like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| and the surrounding density on this side of the road is much lower than what is just east of here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3898)|
| 1:05:08| or sorry, west of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Okay, I thought when you guys do a slope calculation, okay, in the hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| you have different percentage grades and you attribute different densities to each range of grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| like zero to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| You don't do five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| I thought they used to use five units an acre on the flat part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| We don't use the maximum in the low-density residential classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| The density classifications for up to five are typically used in areas where there is more built-out density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3937)|
| 1:05:50| but not necessarily just in every incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| Okay, and I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Did they at one time use five on all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| I thought we did at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| It may have been a couple of years ago or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| It's my understanding that we've looked at what the surrounding density is to make our density recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3967)|
| 1:06:17| Commissioner Smith, that's something that we can look into because I can't answer that affirmatively either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| like how it was done two, three, four years ago, but we can look into that and confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| It just seems like if we were going to allocate 0.2 units an acre or something on the higher end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| we ought to give a little more credit for the flat areas to come up with a fair range for the whole site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=3996)|
| 1:06:46| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Chair recognizes Commissioner Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Ms. Albertson, I'm just trying to get some better understanding of this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| I do see a lot of five-dwelling units per acre across this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| Is that a two-lane street there, it looks like, a two-lane road, Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| And I think if you turn on the growth plan, it's adjacent to the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| And so Mr. Bartholomew had indicated that after the slope analysis it would allow 4.33 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4036)|
| 1:07:26| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| I think that math is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| I don't know that I agree with what he thinks should be allowed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| Okay, so that was one of the factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| Another factor was a road factor, and I guess was the road overriding factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| or was it that it wasn't compatible because it was on the other side of the two-lane road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| I mean, you know, sometimes different sides of the road have different feelings to the way that they're built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4073)|
| 1:08:01| and this side of Henderson has not really been built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| and it hasn't been zoned to be built out the way that the other side of Henderson has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4085)|
| 1:08:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| Mr. Bartholomew, go ahead, you've got a few more minutes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Thank you, Chair, if I could address a couple of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| So if you'll look just to the south, there is a condo development, and it is called Laurel Oaks in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4102)|
| 1:08:31| It only is accessed off that side of Emory Road slash Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| It's at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| The adjacent park property that they used for on the non-hill side is only accessed off of Henderson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4118)|
| 1:08:47| and it's on the same side as my property, and actually my property has an address of West Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| so it will not be accessed off of Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| It will be accessed off of West Emory, just like the development to the south that was zoned for five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4135)|
| 1:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| May I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| Mr. Hill, you're quite welcome to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| I don't have a whole lot of logic behind it other than one nine feels a little restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| and, you know, maybe four and a half or five seems a little much for that side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| but I'd probably try to hit it somewhere at three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| That would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4174)|

| 1:09:57| Ms. Eason, did you vote no on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| Ms. Adams, did you vote aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4200)|

| 1:10:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Okay, so the motion carries with three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4211)|

| 1:11:42| We're not seeing any opposition, so applicant, you have up to five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4302)|

| 1:11:51| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Alan Kurtis, address 43 Woodstock Street in Roswell, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| I'm here representing Clark Crossing LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| and we appreciate the commission and your time to hear our application today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| As you mentioned, what we are requesting is a small extension of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| general commercial zoning in this area to a further depth off of Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| What we have, the commercial zoning would be cohesive with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| surrounding commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| including the shopping center that's next door to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| What we need and the reason for the request would be to achieve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| additional depth of the commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| and with the intention of redeveloping or reoccupying the currently vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| former Dunkin' Donuts building in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| So I appreciate you guys hearing our application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| and obviously we'd be happy to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Chair, we recognize Commissioner Ooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion that we approve staff recommendation on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| sector plan from GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| Motion by Commissioner Ooten, second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Yeah, and I was just going to further add that change of conditions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| trends in development would be the reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Yes, I'm just curious, because hearing the applicant speak and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| understanding that they're trying to actually add this to the Dunkin'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| Donuts or the part of the parcel that is connected to Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| I'm just curious what is required to get that additional footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| What is happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| Ms. Albertson, you would like to address Commissioner Adams' comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| That might be a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Yeah, I was going to maybe recommend that the applicant answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| question as far as what their intended use is for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| When we get to rezoning, it's not appropriate to be asking specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| As our attorney has stated earlier, we're dealing with rezoning and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| the appropriate and allowed uses within that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| Asking about a specific use is not generally considered appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4452)|
| 1:14:22| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| And I'll just share, I did speak with Carson Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| Commissioner for that area, and he did speak with both the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| as well as the Homeowners Association, and they did recommend approval of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| So I will be supporting this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scotsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| I was concerned a minute ago because I really wanted to see a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| justification for a sector plan change, but then I noticed the large track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| that kind of surrounds the parcel that they're changing is owned by the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| person that owns the track we're working on, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| So there will not be any negative effect to an adjoining owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| so I will be supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| Not seeing any other lights on, we have a motion by Commissioner Uden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| seconded by Commissioner Roth to approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4516)|

| 1:16:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| I don't see any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| There is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Would you like to go first or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| I'll go first but reserve some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| Name and address again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Russ Rackley, Rackley Engineering, PO Box 3045637930ZIP here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| representing Homestead Land Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| We asked for PR3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| I know staff has looked at the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| However, when you look at this property, it is neither a ridge nor very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| There's a very developable piece of property up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| And, in fact, the inset parcel adjacent to it was recently, as of a month or two ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4631)|
| 1:17:18| zoned to PR less than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| And we are working with that property owner, who's very difficult to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| to try to work together with his inset parcel along with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| So we highly desire to go with PR less than three to match the zoning with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| so we can work in cooperation with him to try to master plan this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| We have 2.8 units an acre across the road, 1.8 next to it, PR1 to 3 behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4661)|
| 1:17:48| and then PR less than two on the big long farm that is actually my project that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| because it was severely steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| And I wasn't going to try to get more than two units an acre on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| But on this property, I think that PR less than three is completely appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| and doable while still maintaining all of the natural issues of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| and I'll reserve the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| Mr. Douglas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4694)|
| 1:18:27| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Hi. My name is Michael Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| It's 2308 Omaha Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| And thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| I appreciate the commission's time to hear our concerns about this project and this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| Do you mind if I take this off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| In reading through many of the commission's bios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| I kept on coming back to this word sustainability, this word responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| but in evaluating this proposal as well as the other proposals that have already been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| the other building structures that are already going on in the Hardin Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| I see no way that this project can be approved and still maintain any sense of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4748)|
| 1:19:15| When I go back and I look at this, I come back to three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| Number one is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| Number two is infrastructure improvement, roads, utilities, et cetera, as well as development density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4760)|
| 1:19:27| First of all, I'm not aware of it unless there's other information out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| but the last traffic study in the Hardin Valley area was done in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| This is grossly outdated for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| Today traffic is extremely congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| It's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Hardin Valley Road in this area and up until the food city is only two lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4788)|
| 1:19:55| and is inadequate with our current home, the number of homes in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4795)|
| 1:20:03| There are nearly 500 homes that are already approved and to be built within walking distance in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| A traffic study even today would be outdated in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| This is a significant public safety issue that puts our citizens at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| Number two, our school system is already overcrowded in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| There are, again, numbers, hundreds of homes that are already approved that will continue to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| Many homeowners seek the Hardin Valley school system because of its desirability and the good school system that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4829)|
| 1:20:37| We need to consider significant reduction in development in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| and slow down development until this can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| I know many families who are considering moving or moving their kids out of these school systems because of the overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| My own family considers this because of the 20-something kids in each kindergarten class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| Number three, our fire department, our police presence, essentially police is non-existent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| We do have a fire department, a great fire department right there across from food city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| First responders and the fire department is severely outnumbered compared to the number of homes that are about to be built in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4871)|
| 1:21:19| Number four, sidewalks, bike lanes, turn lanes, red lights are non-existent in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| This is a significant public issue, public safety issue rather, that puts our citizens at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| Number five, townhomes are not consistent with any development nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| Homeowners in our area are strongly against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| Mixed use is inconsistent with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| There is no viable mixed use development in our area and for good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| It does not fit with the use that our citizens enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| Sixthly, Mission Hill Lane was fully funded by the developer in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| It is the only entrance and exit to our neighborhood onto Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| This street is the only route for children to get to and from our bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| There is not a clear line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| It is a beautiful, well-maintained, beautiful boulevard entrance maintained by our homeowners association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4932)|
| 1:22:19| which I am a part of with our break entrance sign that we pay for and that we maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| Again, this is a public safety issue when our kids are walking down Mission Hill Lane to get to school, to the school bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4945)|
| 1:22:33| Both high school students, elementary students as well as young as first grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| Seventh, if a development was to be approved, the natural tree lines along Mission Hill Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4960)|
| 1:22:50| as well as the natural tree line behind Salt Creek Lane must be protected to keep this natural sight line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4970)|
| 1:23:00| and to keep a sense of separation between the two developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| This plan is not an extension of Massey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| Mr. Douglas, you've got 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| And allowing an entrance and exit onto Mission Hill Lane will be perceived as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| an entrance into a neighborhood of which it is not is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| So again, going back to this sustainability, this responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| Please conclude your comments, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Please conclude your comment because your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| So I ask the commission to deny this request for rezoning and keep it agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| If you do allow a development, I would ask that you limit that to less than two units an acre per the staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5016)|
| 1:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Please deny any entrance and exit to Mission Hill Lane specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Thank you, Mr. Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Mr. Rackley, you have additional time if you'd like to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| I used to, you had a clock so I could see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| I don't know why we don't now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| Well, I'll try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| I think the majority of the opposition's concerns had more to do with the concept plan as far as access and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5042)|
| 1:24:12| We did do, as required by the growth plan, provide a preliminary traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| Hardin Valley Road has plenty of capacity projected out to 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| There was some concern at 2025 with a level of delay for certain turn movements at the intersection of Marietta Church and Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5063)|
| 1:24:34| Now, of course, the county is currently building a roundabout at Hickory Creek, or it's in the plans to do that with the big development across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| So who knows what that will do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Right now, any traffic studies are kind of hard to do because COVID has affected traffic patterns pretty significantly with people working from home and not commuting every day in schools, not being in session all the time and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5083)|
| 1:24:55| But either way, the Hardin Valley Road itself is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| Sight distance will have to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| In fact, any development on our parcel and the inset parcel there would involve most likely some grading to improve the sight lines on Mission Hill Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5101)|
| 1:25:12| Sewer's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| West Knox just put a 30-inch pressure main through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| I've got a pump station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| West Knox pump station I put in right across from the entrance of Mission Hill Lane for the vining mill subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5116)|
| 1:25:23| Water capacity is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| Again, any talk of what type of units or anything is premature at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| Getting back to what Commissioner Smith said regarding the use of the slope side protection, I was under the impression, too, that since you're using a calculation to limit density, that for the 0 to 15, you would use the maximum density and not whatever you feel maybe the density would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5130)|
| 1:25:54| Because then it's completely subjective and not objective calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| Again, with respect, we would ask for, rezone this for plain residential, less than three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5159)|
| 1:26:07| Give us the flexibility to try to best utilize this parcel and add to the Hardin Valley community in the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| Thank you, Mr. Reckley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| Chair will recognize Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| I was looking through this case the other day, and I also was just looking through it again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| The estimated traffic impact is 840, and transportation has said basically they say that they're going to have to do a traffic impact study above 750,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5189)|
| 1:26:42| so there will have to be one done for this based on the traffic impact letter that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5202)|
| 1:26:51| Having said that, I'd like to make a motion to approve PR at less than three units per acre because it's consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5211)|
| 1:27:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| Before I read that, I'll recognize Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| I'm still discussing, so if you'll bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| I had a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| I had a couple questions for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| I'm a little confused when you mentioned a master plan with an additional lot that might be acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5239)|
| 1:27:26| Is that that lot that's right in the middle with the house on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| Yeah, what I'm calling the inset lot that is owned by a local developer as of recently, and he recently rezoned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5250)|
| 1:27:39| We have had a couple of conversations and a sit-down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| My clients that I represent, a sit-down with him to talk about, obviously, because our property comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| There's a 100-foot wide strip along Mission Hill that's not quite deep enough, and it kind of cuts him off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| It limits where he can put an access, so there's an opportunity to work together there and try to do what's best for the overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| kind of do some overall planning if we can work together, both my clients and him as a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| and whoever his home builder is going to be, and try to make this a more homogeneous development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5289)|
| 1:28:15| Oh, okay, good. Now, Connor Creek, does it flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| I didn't see much discussion about flooding in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| Would you describe the amount of flooding and how you've designed around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| Well, there is a defined—those blue lines are a defined floodplain, and there is a regulatory floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5309)|
| 1:28:36| and within the FEMA guidelines on what can and can't be done in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| the county regulations on what can and can't be done concerning manipulation of floodway fringe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| and obviously no manipulation of the floodway without doing a letter-mapper vision and a whole lot of other stuff through FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5326)|
| 1:28:54| I guess we have provided an initial sketch to some of the surrounding neighbors and to the seller themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5334)|
| 1:29:03| as to what we're kind of envisioning maybe, and that's where the comment about townhomes came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| accessing off of Mission Hill on the other side because we prefer not to cross that floodplain with a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| and a bridge and utilities and all that because you will impact the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| And so our objective is to leave that area natural as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| Since Mission Hill Boulevard is a public right-of-way, it is a public road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| and so we would propose accessing that back part either by us or conceivably even the developer of Mission Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| if we want to work something out with him on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| So, again, this is rezoning. This is to try to rezone this to be consistent with everything around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| and then for us and the other developers that want to work with us to look at holistically what's the best thing to do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5385)|
| 1:29:54| which would be a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| The traffic intention letter, TIL, that indicated traffic amounts at the density that you were requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5396)|
| 1:30:07| Would that traffic letter still be required if it's two or if it's less than three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5407)|
| 1:30:16| Because it's kind of close to the threshold of 750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| Yeah, yeah, generally speaking it's, and I'll let staff answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| but it's when you hit that 750, basically 75 lots if you assume 10 trips per day per household,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| it's usually that 75 number where you trigger needing a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| The street, Mission Hill, that's a public right-of-way, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| And so denying access on that, given it's a public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| and if it meets the setbacks from the corner and the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| that's not really something that the planning commission, at least, that would be more of an engineering design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5455)|
| 1:31:03| and it's not, it's a public street, so it's not a private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| It is a public street, and our property has frontage along a public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| so by law we have rights to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| Now, obviously, maintenance of the signage and entrance would be worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| if we did connect off Mission Hill with the Mission Hill Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| because it would be associated with using that common entrance, associated with that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| So in no world, in fact, we might want to make it prettier than it is today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| and so there would definitely be some cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| And, again, this is all concept plan-related stuff and would definitely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| if it's rezoned and we can take the next step, would definitely be meeting with the Mission Hill HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| because they would be directly involved, but we can't get to that point if it's not zoned for plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| So you're stating that you will work with Mission Hill HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Okay, and then my last question, and thank you for your patience, is for Mr. Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| Some of the comments on this application talked about requiring a brick home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| requiring a threshold of $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| The fair housing law, would you speak to why we can't be doing that kind of stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5534)|
| 1:32:23| You can't be doing that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| I'll say that there's no design requirements in the city or the county zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| as it relates to single-family homes, so it's not something that we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| Chair recognizes Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| I just wanted to say that I think for the sake of developing a harmonious development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| that up to three makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| My question is an overall question for staff and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| Is it possible for you guys to collaborate and do some sort of presentation in the next month or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| whether it's during our agenda review or prior to the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| just regarding the Hardin Valley area and the mobility plan and infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| Because this has come up, I think, every month for the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| and I think that the public and to an extent some commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| just don't have a comprehensive summary of what the plan for this area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| Obviously TDOT and money plays into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| Development precedes infrastructure, but it would just be nice to see a summary of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5614)|
| 1:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Commissioner Dent, I'll just comment real quickly on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| We do have the Hardin Valley mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| I can't commit that we can do it within the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| We can definitely provide a presentation of what that plan entailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| And I'd like to jump on that, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| One of the gentlemen who spoke, Michael, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| he mentioned that infrastructure might include services such as emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| and I'm totally unfamiliar with the coverage of our emergency services in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| Just a point of clarification on Mr. Ross' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| Commissioner, you mentioned less than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| Two dwelling units is less than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| I think you meant to say up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| And Commissioner Smith, do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| So the motion is to approve PR plan residential up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5671)|
| 1:34:39| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Thank you for clarifying Commissioner Ross' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| I just wanted to state that the staff recommendation was up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| So you heard the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Commissioner Adams and Commissioner Korbelick are saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| Motion carries two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5705)|

| 1:36:55| Here on behalf of the applicant, urban engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| as stated by Chairman Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| there is a request for sector plan amendment to rural residential as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| as a rezoning request to PR up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5826)|
| 1:37:13| As expressed in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| the sector plan amendment request satisfies the requirements of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| general plan based on there being changes in conditions since it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| enacted as well as trends in development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| This applies as well for the rezoning request to plan resident for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| macroculture plan residential up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| The changes in conditions consist of the development of new utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| the expansion of a wastewater plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| There are plans to improve the road system there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| There's been the recent development of a new middle school with the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| to develop a new elementary school in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| It's meant that a reasonable request of up to two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| is supported by the developments in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| the existing ones and the recently approved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| In fact, last meeting there was a rezoning approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| on a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| The sector plan amendment in this area was amended to LDR with plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| residential up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| In that same...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| In that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| Ms. Stetstrom, could you mute your audio, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| Continue, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| It's meant that these properties are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| It's meant that these properties are similarly situated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| not in size but in slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| In fact, this property actually has arguably less hillside slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| That staff recommended, I believe, if I recall correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| a density of up to 1.52 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| As stated earlier, this body approved up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| We believe that in applying the up to two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5953)|
| 1:39:21| this will allow for feasible development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| not arguing that that is going to increase profits for the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| but makes it feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| When you have these smaller tracts, it's 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| With smaller tracts, it's a lot harder to overcome the infrastructure cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| if you're not going to end up with the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| that some of the larger tracts produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| Here we have 18 acres based on staff recommendation of 1.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| You're ending up with 33 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| versus what we're requesting up to two is 37 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| That's four lots difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| That is instrumental and impactful when it comes to, as stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| the infrastructure costs and offsetting those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| I've confirmed with the Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| that they don't see any significant increase or load on the traffic in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| and aren't concerned about that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| With that being said, we request that you approve our sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| to rural residential and regional property to plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| Ms. Stetstrom, you're now able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| Give us your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| You have up to five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6036)|
| 1:40:45| Ms. Stetstrom, are you still with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| We can hear you loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| Please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| I'm going to read what I have prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| My name is Jennifer Stetstrom, and our family owns 1717 Long Farm Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| here in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| This is my third time speaking with you just since November of last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| regarding subdivisions on North Campbell Station between the short distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| of Hardin Valley Road and Yarnell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| Again, I and many other residents in the community would like this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| to remain agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| This will still allow the developer to build one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| on this 18-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| Whether this is financially feasible for the developer or not is not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| concern or the issue at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| I can talk about overcrowding of schools and traffic and road safety as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| previous Hardin Valley resident discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| You already know these issues, but every meeting these items are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| addressed and another development is approved or another parcel is rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| Even today that is still happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| Again, I'd like the planning commissioners to look at the bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| As of today, Hardin Valley is not a part of the growth plan, yet here we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| again looking to rezone another large parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| I'd like to quote commissioner's statements directly from the April meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| and respond to the quotes as I did not have an opportunity last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| and they are relevant to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Here are some quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| I don't see how we don't consider these tracks in this location of Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| Valley to be in the growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| To say we are going to hold our density at one and two units per acre in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| these areas is just a really inefficient use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| Honestly, the difference in two and three units per acre when you build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| subdivision out, it's not noticeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| We're not even going to be able to tell the difference between two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| This is going to the mindset of some of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| If planning commissioners and county commissioners want to amend the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| plan, that is a serious and much-needed conversation to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| However, until that is completed, we all need to play the game with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| same set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| It doesn't matter how commissioners feel about the growth of an area or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| they think is efficient or not efficient use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| The existing growth plan is what needs to be abided by so all residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| property owners, developers, and county officials understand the parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| These parameters must be across the board and not decided parcel by parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| If this parcel is rezoned and a subdivision built on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| the entire ridge from North Campbell Station all the way to Marietta Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| The entire ridge and the hillside protection of residential lots in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| rural zoned area that is not in the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| This is setting another detrimental precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| This is only happening because the county and other officials are choosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| to rezone more and more rural and agricultural parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| ignoring all of the reports and studies that are intended to protect these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| Every single time I've watched a meeting in the past six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| this following sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| because it is consistent with the surrounding area is constantly used to set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| new precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| The residents of Hardin Valley are frustrated and deflated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| We submit comments on each rezoning case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| When do we get a say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| How can we be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| What about our property rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Specifically, I have two issues regarding my lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| First is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Long Farm Way is a private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| It used to consist of eight parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| but because the 41 acre lot was rezoned to rural residential in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| we are now at seven adjoining parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| These are four easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| There are four easements on this private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| These parcels on Long Farm Way were designed to be rural in nature and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| never meant to be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| Each property owner purchased these parcels knowing this to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Yet here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| The only way the 41 acre lot was able to be rezoned was through the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| door via a parcel on North Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| Approving this rezoning would allow incompatible lot sizes compared to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6284)|

| 1:44:50| This would give this property development rights that the other adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| parcels would not be afforded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| For example, I am only allowed to build two houses on my parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| and I am not allowed to subdivide because I am on an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| I have tried to email the planning department with my questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| and I'm still confused on my options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| I've left multiple messages to the person I was referred to speak with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| and have not received a return phone call for answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| As I understand it, I cannot build four houses for myself and my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| on our 20 acre farm, but a developer can build over 30 homes in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| I'd like the planning commissioners to know that density does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| Excuse me, Ms. Stedstrom, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| Every additional home built in my backyard will affect our farm and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| daily life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| My second issue, I would like to know what is going to happen to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| easement leading up to this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Who gets the easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| I need to make sure heavy trucks and absolutely no traffic is driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| anywhere on this gravel road, as I am financially responsible for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| and it would cause our family a financial burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| At a bare minimum, because this parcel is not in the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| the planning staff analysis and recommendation of 1.8 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| per acre should be supported and honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| However, I and other property owners in the area urge you to please keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| this parcel agricultural and rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Thank you, Ms. Stedstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| You know, I think this applicant is very reasonable in his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| His parcel is right next to the LDR low density residential that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| Saddlebrook's building on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| You know, he's asking for – I think we should deal with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| issue first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| There's no question that this area is deserving of a sector plan revisit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6401)|
| 1:46:48| and I think that the sector plan change that he's requesting is modest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| so I would be very supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| And I would just say, you know, everybody cites the growth plan about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| why we shouldn't – you know, we need to stick to the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| But, you know, the only place in the growth plan that LDR exists is when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| developers request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| You know, the growth plan, if you really want to hang your hat on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| then set aside some land right now and designate it so that developers have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| a target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| They know where you want them to grow, because there is none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| I mean, everything is rural residential unless somebody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| brings it up here to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| And that's how we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| So I just – I think, you know, it's obvious the growth – the only way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| get this is to come in here and these guys request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| You know, I know Ms. – I think it's Ms. Stinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| She makes very good points, and we love – I'm sorry, Stenstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| But, I mean, her lot is 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| You know, not everybody can afford to live on a 17-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| I mean, it's a beautiful place, and she's very fortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| and we appreciate all her thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| and we need to listen carefully to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| But I feel like this is a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| So I would support a sector plan change first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| and I also would be supportive of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| giving the developer the benefit of four additional lots to see if he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| And just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| It's come up a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Is there a standard dwelling unit that all the calculations go into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| Like this one, they asked for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| It came in at 1.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| The other one asked for up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| It came in at two-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| They're kind of all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| I'm just – I'm mostly just trying to learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| what's the number that every one of our planning staff uses in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| calculation that's the base number to come up with these calculations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| Because it seems a little bit all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| I'll let staff answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| but my first blush, Commissioner, is that each parcel is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| that each one has its own separate peculiarities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| and that's probably what's driving the difference in densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| I'll let either Ms. Brooks or Ms. Albertson speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| Commissioner Phillips said what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| Each property is unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| and we look at it as a unique piece of property and the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| development and the plans that are in place that include that piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| But, again, this is going back for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| On one side of the street, they could do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| Literally, they just looked across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| and it was assumed because it wasn't over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| we need to come up with some other nebulous number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| Is there a formula or a written plan of what everyone follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6587)|
| 1:49:54| or is it just up to each person as they're kind of basing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| calculations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| That's where I'm trying to understand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| I'm trying to find the common thread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| and so far I'm not able to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| I would just like to interject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| The slope analysis that you see with the applications that come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| that intersect with these hillside and ridgetop protection areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| there is a calculation that's included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| So if you go to, I don't know, I didn't see it on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| I don't know if it got dropped out of that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| But if you would pull up the slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6631)|
| 1:50:40| the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| or, yeah, there is a formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6642)|
| 1:50:53| So the zero to 15% is given a density that's based on several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6653)|
| 1:51:01| Looking at the surrounding density is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| And that applies as well to the areas outside of the slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| So the same way that we look at properties that aren't in a slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| protection area and say what is the appropriate density is the same way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| would look at properties that are in the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| But when you run the slope analysis, the 15 to 25% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6682)|
| 1:51:28| the recommendation for that is two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| And the 25 to 40% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| I think the recommendation for that is .5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6696)|
| 1:51:43| So there is an actual calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| So then my question, I guess, and this is more for future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| can we start including that information on this document so that we know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| I think that would help not only us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| it would help the applicant so we could see what went into those calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| on each one of these pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Yes, and it usually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| I'm sorry, I don't understand why it's not in the packet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| But we provided the applicant with the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| and we also provided Ms. Stenstrom with the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| It should be with the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| It's with all the others that intersect with hillside areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6743)|
| 1:52:30| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| I can show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| We can do that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| I just wanted to concur with the observations by Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| The purpose of the growth policy plan, at least originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| was to do exactly what he was observing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| that we would designate where it should stay rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| and where we want to concentrate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| I think what we're up against is the fact that that growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| which was to be updated every, I think, three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| hasn't been updated in 20, and the general plan is also woefully old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| We need to start working on the framework so that we have more certainty for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| neighbors and for the developers as to what they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| and what might be a little more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| I did have a couple of traffic questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| I read the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| I actually wanted to say this was a really well-written and clear traffic report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| I was a little concerned about the impact on the intersection of Yarnell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6823)|
| 1:53:50| and Hardin Valley, I think that's it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| because it indicated that when it's adjusted an additional 20 percent to compensate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| for the decrease in traffic during the COVID period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| that those intersections would actually pretty much fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| And I didn't know, and I also saw the mobility plan and the projects identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| but I'm not clear when implementation will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| And I think that would go to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| Are you talking planning staff or are you talking about engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| Whoever wants to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| The director's note is coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| Yes, Ms. Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| We do have a couple of things in the pipeline for Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6883)|
| 1:54:50| I noticed in your packet there they do have three alternatives for the proposed alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| or proposed realignments of Campbell Station that was identified in the Hardin Valley mobility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6896)|
| 1:55:03| We have asked WSP, they are a planning consultant that is doing the TDOT I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| TDOT's doing an I-40 corridor study throughout the entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| In addition, at that study, TDOT has asked them to look at the interchanges of Watt Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| and Campbell Station as part of the Hardin Valley mobility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| We realize we've got, as a county, to get people in and out of Hardin Valley in better fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| so we have asked WSP to look at both entrances into Hardin Valley, both the west one at Watt Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6929)|
| 1:55:36| and the eastern one at Campbell Station, and give us planning level estimates and kind of a best alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6936)|
| 1:55:44| and then approach both those projects, both the Watt Road and the Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| are in the mobility plan 2045, the TPO just updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| So we're going to, at that point in time, once that study gets complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| try to approach and obtain state and federal dollars to obtain, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| to improve both those roadway connections into Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| So you don't know right now, there has to be a study and then you need to get in line with TDOT for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| Yes, ma'am. Due to the scope of those projects, I mean, those are probably, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| 40 and 50 million dollar roadway projects that the county feels like are regionally significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| that state dollars and federal dollars should participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| Thank you. My last question is, I know that there is some interest in going up to the two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6988)|
| 1:56:39| My concern is that the reason given by the applicant had to do with financial concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| and Mr. Wise advised us two meetings ago that that wasn't a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7005)|
| 1:56:53| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to make a motion to approve rural residential hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| because it's consistent with the gross policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| and one could argue that it meets all three of these sector amendment requirements in the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7025)|
| 1:57:13| We have a motion by Commissioner Raw to approve our rural residential per staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| seconded by Commissioner Scott-Smith. All in favor of the motion, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7039)|
| 1:57:25| Opposed? Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| I'd like to make a motion we approve planned residential up to two dwelling units per acre because it's consistent with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| We have a motion by Commissioner Raw, seconded by Commissioner Scott-Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| to approve PR planned residential up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7058)|
| 1:57:44| All for the motion, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| Two noes? Warbick and Adams, correct? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| I had a no also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| It's kind of difficult when you all got your mask on, and it's a little hard for me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| So we had four opposed. Commissioner Eason, Commissioner Adams, Commissioner Korbelick, and Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7083)|
| 1:58:10| Is that correct? Yes. Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7090)|
| 1:58:17| All right. Going on to item number 25, this was removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| The applicant is Logan Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| This is a rezoning location west side of Oswald Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| north of Hiawassee Avenue and west of North Broadway Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| Size of tract is 8.16 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| The present zoning is IH heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| Zoning requested IMU industrial mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| Staff's recommendation, approve IMU industrial mixed use zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| because it is more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the existing zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| and would bring the property to compliance with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| Is the applicant present? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| Your name and address, please. Logan Higgins, 133 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| Mr. Higgins, you have up to five minutes, please, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| This property sits two blocks away from Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| It sits up against industrial buildings, single family homes, and the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7164)|
| 1:59:31| It's been vacant for many years, but in the past it's been the site of large fires, crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| and even accidental deaths from the heavy industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| Our plan, with the support of the neighborhood, is to change the zoning to industrial mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| This would allow for light industrial, commercial, and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7187)|
| 1:59:53| which we believe is in line with everything around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| And this, like you said, is in line with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| as well as this is similar to many other sites that received the IMU zoning in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7204)|
| 2:00:13| In preparation for the rezoning request, we met with planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| and talked to them about what would be the best zoning for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| We also met with individual neighbors and with the neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| and walked the property with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| And then we created a packet explaining our intent and ways that people could reach out to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| and the neighborhood association posted it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| We received comments, questions, answered all the questions thoroughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| and received no negative responses from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7241)|
| 2:00:49| Furthermore, my personal cell phone number was sent out to many of the adjacent neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| and so I got a few phone calls from that, but all of those ended well as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| So we've not had anyone to speak out against the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7261)|
| 2:01:06| but we do think that it would be highly impactful for the neighborhood to have this other zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| Our intent is to develop residential and commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| but obviously that doesn't matter to you all right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| So we hope that you all will vote in favor. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| Mr. Higgins, you may not want to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| There is an individual who would like to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| If you'd like to step forward, please, and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| I'm David Morgan, 2212 Delta Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| Could you pull the microphone a little closer to you, please? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| Did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| Dory, did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| Could you repeat your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| I'm David Morgan, 2212 Delta Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7314)|
| 2:02:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| I own the property right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| In fact, his property will, if it's my building, he gets the side and the back of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7326)|
| 2:02:14| I'm I-4, have at least a group that remanufactures diesel heads and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7334)|
| 2:02:23| My main concern, and I don't know the answer, that's why I'm asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| what does this do to future rental ability of my property in years to come if it's residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7348)|
| 2:02:37| I mean, am I going to be rezoned to something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| Where do I stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| What is your property currently zoned at now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| I'm I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| No, this does not rezone your property unless you initiate that rezoning yourself as the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7368)|
| 2:02:56| That I understand, but if this goes through, which I assume it's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7376)|
| 2:03:07| and I'm sitting there with an acre a little over that's I-4 and got 25 to 30,000 square feet on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7387)|
| 2:03:16| my only use is probably keeping it I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| So all I'm asking is, does this affect zoning in 10 years from now or 20 years from now if I've still got it or the family's got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7400)|
| 2:03:31| I'm just wondering what this does to the jointed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| It shouldn't have any effect on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| You can still use it under I-4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| Now, what happens in 10 or 20 years beyond my, what happens 10 to 20 years is beyond my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7423)|
| 2:03:50| It's beyond mine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| But that's all I was wondering is what this would do because there is, my building's a zero lot line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7432)|
| 2:04:03| I bought it from the people that own everything around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| And so the property line, I think, is six inches from my building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7447)|
| 2:04:14| And, you know, if you've got manufacturing going on and windows open trying to circulate air for different reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7454)|
| 2:04:23| heat or cooling or whatever, I would just, I don't know how close they can build to the end of my building there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7463)|
| 2:04:32| which would be on that shot, would be on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| Is there any setbacks or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| I'm just trying to find out what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| Sir, the rezoning of property adjacent to you will not alter setbacks on your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7483)|
| 2:04:50| nor would it precipitate a type of rezoning of any kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| Your property would be grandfathered in, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| even if somehow your underlying zoning changed, whatever your use would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7496)|
| 2:05:02| grandfathered in construction adjacent to you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| If one of the premises of the law is moving to a nuisance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| if your building were deemed to be a nuisance to residential property because of the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7509)|
| 2:05:15| or the proximity of the property line or things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| no one would be permitted to complain because you're there first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| and your uses are established, and I think you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| I think you're comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| If you're really unsure, you might want to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| That's all I'm trying to find out is where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| I think you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| You might want to talk to a competent real estate lawyer to assure you on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| but there's nothing transpiring here that would adversely affect the use of your property tomorrow or the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7539)|
| 2:05:50| One other quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7550)|
| 2:05:52| Is this zoning, I'll say downstep zoning, going to residential and mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7552)|
| 2:06:06| is that the reason I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| I've got some land I'd like to maybe do that to, but is that a common something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| I mean, I've not run into this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Is this something that we see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| I think we're seeing more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| More of it, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Particularly on small tracts like this where industrial zoning may not be really appropriate because of the smaller size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7581)|
| 2:06:30| You've answered my question, so I'm going to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| I'll recognize Commissioner Hooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| Believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| Commissioner Hooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the zoning request for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| I'd like a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| There will be a motion by Commissioner Hooten, a second by Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| to approve industrial mixed use for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7621)|
| 2:07:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| Next item is item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| The applicant is Kevin Mellon, Tom Dalton Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| Location, north side of Tazewell Pike, south side of Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| Size of tract, 0.96 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| Zoning requested, RA, low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| Staff recommendation, approved RA zoning because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7650)|
| 2:07:39| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| I'm the applicant, Kevin Mellon, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| And your address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| P.O. Box 1240, Kodak, Tennessee, 37764.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| And Ms. Karen Gay Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| You do have one person that is opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| Would you like to go first or would you like Ms. Johnson to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| Ms. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| Ms. Johnson, do you want to step up to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| And give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| Karen Gay Johnson, 5604 West Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| And I'm a homeowner on Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| I'm representing the other homeowners on Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| Yes, there's residential RA all around us, but none of them have access to Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7699)|
| 2:08:27| Luttrell Road is a dead-end street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| It says on here on the application that the road is 16 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| It's actually 14 and goes, narrows down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| It says that this is an undeveloped piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| There's an existing home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| The person that owned it now owned it four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| And for two years, the occupancy of that home had a negative impact on our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7733)|
| 2:09:03| We don't – the homeowners don't really care whether it's RA or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| We just think that the access to that then needs to come off of Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| because all the RA around us goes into a bigger road, whether that be Tazewell Pike or Kesterbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7753)|
| 2:09:23| That's all we have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| I do have pictures of the house that's on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| and the condition that it has been in for the four years that the current owner has had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| And the two years that it was occupied, it was used as foster care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| Very negative impact on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| And I do have 15 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| I don't know if you're able to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| If you would give them to one of the staff members there, Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7794)|
| 2:10:04| Thank you, Ms. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| What we're looking for is simply rezoning in accordance with the area around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7809)|
| 2:10:15| and along with the staff recommendation, we're looking to do the RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7815)|
| 2:10:21| We're not looking to do anything crazy with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| All we're looking to do is create a duplex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| When the original investor had bought the property, she had come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| and basically the property has been, as long as we can foresee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| has been almost like a two-unit duplex anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| There was a separate upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| There's two separate driveway entrances off of Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| There's a separate kitchen upstairs, separate kitchen downstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| separate water heating, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| So what we're looking to do is get it rezoned to RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| and that should be in concurrence with some of the units around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7859)|
| 2:11:04| with the zoning that's in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| The traffic coming off of Tazewell Pike, Tazewell Pike being a major artery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| seems like it would be a lot more cumbersome to try and bring traffic off of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| instead of using the two existing driveways that come off of Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| Is there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| I see none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| Are you the current owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| No, I'm the contractor for the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| Are you going to buy this and do something with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| or are you going to be hired by the current owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| We are actually working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| The history of the project is we had started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| and submitted our plans to create a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| and basically divide the upstairs and downstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| in addition to adding on a little extra master suite to each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| We submitted the plans to Knox County Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| got approval for the plans, pulled the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| and we're basically about 75% through the project at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| Then a complaint was filed by the neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| and we had a stock work order on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| We were in collaboration with Knox County Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| and the recommendation was try to move that toward RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| In other words, the pictures we see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| the house has not been in the greatest shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| but with this zoning you can refresh the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7955)|
| 2:12:41| where the neighbors would be much more happy with the way it appears?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| It's been a construction site for the last year and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| because we started on the project with approval from the Codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| and approval as to code compliance and approval as to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| We proceeded, and she's invested over $100,000 in the property already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| to get it to about the 80% part where it is now once the complaint was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| There were some tenants in there in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| and we finally were able to get possession of the property back to continue the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7992)|
| 2:13:19| Now we're trying to complete the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| which will be much better as far as the property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8001)|
| 2:13:28| I noticed in one of the public comments there was a question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| we obviously had another purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| but there's really nothing else that can be done with that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| other than the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| We're not really changing the footprint other than the small addition on the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| with the two master bedrooms, one up and one down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| and that was just to make the property more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| because it was rather large for a single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| but it was a little small for two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| so we've added to the square footage to where we've got about 1,200 to 1,500 feet up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8038)|
| 2:14:03| That will also allow us to get a better renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| It seems like a very reasonable request because there's RA all around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| and if you aren't successful in getting it rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| it sounds like the property is going to be in a very bad position for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| Can I say something to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| As an architect and as agriculture zoned, he's allowed a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| He can have a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| What we don't like is the amount of traffic that he's wanting to bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8067)|
| 2:14:31| Get him on Tazewell Pike, and we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| Give him access off of Tazewell Pike, and we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| All the other RAs have access off of not on Metro Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8077)|
| 2:14:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| I think we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| The issue we ran into with the zoning was that she is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| A duplex can be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| That's why we submitted plans to Knox County Codes with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| The problem is when you look down deeper in there, which was presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| which was never even noticed until the complaint was filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| is that you have to have two acres, and the property is one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8102)|
| 2:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| I'll make a motion that we approve the RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, seconded by Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| to approve RA zoning per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| Before we go on to Item 27, let's take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8134)|
| 2:16:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| The next item is Number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| This is a Scepter Plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| The applicant is Robert Gregory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| Location, north side of Fort Sumter and west side of Maynardville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8172)|
| 2:16:19| Track is four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| Present plan designation zoning is agriculture, hillside protection, and agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| Proposed plan designation zoning, GC general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| HP hillside protection, CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| Staff recommendation, do not deny GC general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| because the property is within the rural area of the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| and is inconsistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| Second motion, recommendations, deny CA general business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| because this property is within the rural area of the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| and is inconsistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| Mr. Gregory, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| I'm here for the applicant today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| We've got, well, that's Dennis Gore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| I'm Dennis Gore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| Any opposition to this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| Mr. Gore, do you have, give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| and you have up to five minutes, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| My name is Dennis Gore, 7540 Gary White Road, Carriageton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| Black Oak Contracting Incorporated was formed in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| as a licensed contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| It's also approved by TDOT as a road contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| and approved contractor for federal projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| Black Oak started in 2016 and has now outgrown its present location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| This proposal is to rezone four acres of the total 8.08 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| at the corner of Fort Sumter Road and Highway 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| The applicant, Mr. Robert Gregory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| requests this rezoning to build a shop on this site for his use only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| for 36 units of equipment that presently stay on different job sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| and are maintained at the subject job sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| He needs a place to bring his equipment that needs repairing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8291)|
| 2:18:19| He also intends to build his personal house on the remaining site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| Black Oak has an estimated $13 million in 2021 average gross income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8304)|
| 2:18:30| and employs lots of people or several people in the Knox County area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| We respectfully request that you consider this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8315)|
| 2:18:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| Commissioners, do you have any questions for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8330)|
| 2:18:56| Commissioner, Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| Thank you, Chair, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| Here's my only concern, and I shared this with Director Brooks earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| On the conditions warranting the amendment change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| it says that no significant changes have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| However, I think it fails to understand that in the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| Highway 33 has been extended from a two-lane road to a five-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| That intersection is now an actual four-way intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| where it did not exist that way prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| I understand this is still in the rural development area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| not part of the growth plan, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| the growth plan is now almost 21 years out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| So I think it's incumbent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| I'm going to keep hammering this until County Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| or somebody listens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| that they really need to take a look at the growth plan for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| and do an update because it's honestly woefully inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8387)|
| 2:19:51| I mean, if you look at the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| it was put into place before Facebook existed, before Twitter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| before Google search engine, before Google Earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| I mean, everything that we use now did not exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| when the growth plan was put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| In my lifetime, I'm 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| We've had two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8408)|
| 2:20:09| At the rate we're going, we might have one more before I die at 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| And that's just not a great way to think about growth in a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| that is growing as fast as it is at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| and especially in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| I mean, when I served in the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| ECD told us that the Knoxville metropolitan area in the next 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| was going to grow in excess of 250,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| Our growth plan is not adequate to keep up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| So I'm going to hammer until someone starts fixing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| I have spoken with Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| He is supportive of fixing the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| So I do have to follow with zoning and everything that applies right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| So while this may fail today, just hold on to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| because I still think that this is something that needs to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| and an updated plan for this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| to be able to help guide better development across the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| And I would add the general plan is in also sorry state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8467)|
| 2:21:12| I think we should be doing both, not one without the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| Thank you, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| So under agricultural AG&A that it is presently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8482)|
| 2:21:32| they're not prevented from having a home in a garage in agricultural, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8492)|
| 2:21:43| He's saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8503)|
| 2:21:44| You're saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8504)|
| 2:21:45| It's a service garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| That's in question, not a personal garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8506)|
| 2:21:53| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| I make a motion to approve the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| to deny, I'm getting here, the general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| because the property is within the rural area of the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| and is inconsistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Korbelick, seconded by Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| to deny GC general commercial per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8544)|

| 2:22:31| Roth, Eddie Smith, Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| I will proceed then with the second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8561)|
| 2:22:42| That's fine, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| To deny the CA general business because this property is within the rural growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8563)|
| 2:22:50| of the growth policy plan and is inconsistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| We have a motion by Commissioner Korbelick, seconded by Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| to deny CA general business per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8589)|
| 2:23:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8590)|
| 2:23:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| Same three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8594)|
| 2:23:15| Roth, Eddie Smith, and Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8595)|
| 2:23:21| Next item is a subdivision concept use on review, agenda item number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8601)|
| 2:23:28| The subdivision is M&M Partners, Pebble Pass Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8608)|
| 2:23:34| The location is south side of West Emory Road, north terminus of Pebble Pass Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8614)|
| 2:23:40| east of Oakhurst Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| Acreage is 29.31 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision consisting of 82 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8629)|
| 2:23:55| We have a number of variances and alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8635)|
| 2:24:02| requiring planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| Staff recommendation, approve variances one through two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8645)|
| 2:24:11| and alternative design standards one through two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| based on the recommendation of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| and the proposed variances and alternative design standards will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| Second motion is to approve the concept plan subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8672)|
| 2:24:40| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| My name is Mike McTeague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| I'm an engineer with Batson, Himes, Novell, and Poe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| I'm joined here today by Mr. Wallace McClory, the owner developer of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| and we're here to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8695)|
| 2:25:01| Do you have any comments you want to make regarding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| We've read through the conditions put forth by county staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| and we're in agreement with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| We have no issues or concerns, but if you do, we'd be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| All right. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| Staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| Chair will recognize Commissioner Corbelay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| Yes, I have a few questions for, let me see, for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8721)|
| 2:25:28| We did receive a letter saying that there was some concern about flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| for the historic Cherokee cave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| and there was some concern about this development would exacerbate a recent flood incidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| Do you have any familiarity with that situation and can you respond to that concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| I've read the letter myself that you're speaking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| and I know that the owner, Mr. McClory, has also read that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8750)|
| 2:25:53| and he has spoken to the owners of the caverns themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| and the county, I believe, has also looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| and they have not seen where there would be any issues with any flooding that could be created by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| and the owner of the caverns is also in agreement with that with Mr. McClory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| So you're aware of it and you'll be sensitive to the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| I'm sorry, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| You're aware of the caverns and you'll be sensitive to the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| Yes, sir. I'm sorry. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| I had another traffic question and I'm going to address it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8778)|
| 2:26:24| I hope you can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| It indicated that there may be a warrant for improvements to justify a signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8785)|
| 2:26:33| but that T-dot typically doesn't use that level of warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8793)|
| 2:26:39| Can you give me a little background on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| A little bit. I'm familiar, again, with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| The traffic study does imply that that intersection down at the corner of Pebble Pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| I believe it's Oak Ridge Highway, would possibly need a traffic light at some point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8810)|
| 2:26:57| and you stated earlier, I believe, that because of the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| and the lack of traffic patterns and the way they've been altered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| that right now it doesn't trigger the T-dot criteria for that light to be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| but it could be re-examined later on in time and that would be up to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8828)|
| 2:27:13| to possibly set a standard when we might want to re-evaluate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| when people start going back to work in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| Would that re-evaluation occur during development of this project or would it occur later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| Again, ma'am, I'm having trouble understanding you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| I'm sorry. Maybe I'm too close to the mic. Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| A little bit. You were just getting a little echo. I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| Okay. Yeah. I was just wondering when that reassessment might occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8854)|
| 2:27:38| That would be a designation provided by the county for us to re-evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| All right. I had a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| You show a couple ponds in the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8866)|
| 2:27:49| Is that a stormwater detention pond or is that an actual pond-to-pond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8869)|
| 2:27:54| That is, will it be fenced or will it be open to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| They would be stormwater detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| At this point, generally they're not fenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| but those ponds aren't fully designed at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| If they were designed and they were found to be deep enough and weren't fencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| absolutely they would have it for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| But right now the design is not at that level of minute detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| Okay. So the usable open space that we're looking at may or may not be the ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8896)|
| 2:28:23| There is a bark park shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| Unfortunately, its area covers the required buffer perimeter of 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8906)|
| 2:28:34| and then also a stream part of the 50-foot stream buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| And so I was wondering what improvements you'll be making to that bark park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| in recognition of the buffer requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| Now, we would not go within the 25-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| We would be allowed to do some clearing within the 50-foot portion of that buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| between the 25 and the 50-foot area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| and we would do everything we could in there to clear it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| and make it available to people to get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| Let me see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8942)|
| 2:29:12| So, yes, a major portion of that is outside the 50-foot buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| so we would not be within that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| Now, we would be crossing that stream to get over there to the bark park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8957)|
| 2:29:21| for the people to get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| I'm not sure what else you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8963)|
| 2:29:28| Well, I might be mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| When I looked at the site plan for the bark park, the outline of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8969)|
| 2:29:33| which I assumed you were going to put up fencing for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| intruded into the 25-foot perimeter and the part of the 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8976)|
| 2:29:42| Maybe I misread the site plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| I'm not familiar with all the minor details of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| but we would not do anything that would get within that buffer that would be opposed by TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8987)|
| 2:29:55| And your improvements will be to simply clear it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| or will you erect fencing for the dogs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| Again, ma'am, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9000)|
| 2:30:01| I do not have great hearing from past military experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| and I am having trouble understanding what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9004)|
| 2:30:10| I'm trying to ask you what the improvements to the bark park will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| And you mentioned clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| and I was hoping that you would also mention erecting a fence for the security of the dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| Generally, all the bark parks that we do develop, we do fence around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| I do apologize, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| I had a question similar to Commissioner Korbelik's about the caves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| that were referenced in some of the comments that came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| And I just wondered if anyone from engineering had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| if the caves had popped up on their assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| or someone from the planning that wanted to comment about the caves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9049)|
| 2:30:55| They're more than a quarter mile away from the closest point of the caves property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9055)|
| 2:31:02| The stream that goes through this property goes under Oak Ridge Highway east of the caves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9062)|
| 2:31:11| So there's no closed contours that would indicate karst activity on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9071)|
| 2:31:19| And if they've touched base already with the caves, I don't really see it as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9085)|
