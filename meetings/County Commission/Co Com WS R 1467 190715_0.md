| 0:00:30| Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the July meeting of the Knox County Commission work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=30)|
| 0:00:45| I'm sure we've got some folks who may be joining us for their first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| We also may have some folks at home who are maybe watching the meeting on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| But just to give you all a brief overview of how things work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| Knox County Commission meets as two formal meetings a month, a work session meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| followed by a official what I call voting meeting the following Monday after their work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=62)|
| 0:01:09| So the purpose of tonight's meeting is to work through our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| There are going to be certain items that will be put on our consent agenda that will be voted on at one vote at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=74)|
| 0:01:21| So that will be efficient with our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| We'll also have a handful of items that will be sent forward to next week's meeting that will have additional discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=83)|
| 0:01:30| and will be voted on at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| Then we'll have some items tonight that will both be discussed and or voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| and be voted on to be added to the consent agenda for next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| So that's our purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| We have public forum tonight, and we have a very important agenda to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=104)|

| 0:02:12| All right. Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| I'd like to ask Commissioner Gill to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Please stand if you are able and salute our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=152)|

| 0:02:42| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| Also, before we jump into public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| I see that we've got a few special guests here that have made time on their schedule to join us at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| First of all, I see Tom Spangler, Sheriff Tom, in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler, for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Super Bob Thomas is our school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| Superintendent Thomas, thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| And Nick McBride. Where's Nick? I thought I saw you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| All right. Thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| Always ask, as always seize him. Is Charlie Susano here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| I'll have to tell the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| He's mad at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Is he tired of me calling him out for Sister Paulinas who got mad at us in elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| Happened all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| All right. But thank you all for being with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| First, I'd like to go to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| And I have a special guest for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| Brian Hare, who will be speaking on behalf of Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Good evening, Commission. Brian Hare, 12811 Saddleway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| I wanted to rise tonight to discuss personnel issues with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| Good people are hard to come by. We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| For you that have been in business or you that work in the government, you know when you find good folks, you want to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| Unfortunately, we have a few that are going to be departing our county government this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| And the world I came from in commercial banking, the reputation that you want to build with your client base is one of being a trusted advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| And I've been very fortunate that a lot of the folks that I've worked with over the last year at the county have become trusted advisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=254)|
| 0:04:21| two of which will be leaving this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| And before I say names, my life has been threatened as the chief of staff by my subordinates not to say anything or do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| because certain people choose to not be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| I assured them there were no proclamations, there were no proclamations by commission or the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| but the mayor would be here to make these comments, but he is out of town at the NACO conference, so he does send his regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| Upon coming to the county, we were privileged to have good leadership left behind from Mayor Burchett with some of his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| Two notably, Mark Jones, our Senior Director of Risk Management, Benefits and Human Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=294)|
| 0:05:02| and Colonel Julian, our Human Resources Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| The colonel's been with the county a little over eight years, and Mark, 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| That is not replaceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| The leadership that these men have displayed while they have been here at the county faithfully serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| the people that they have helped, the policies that they have put in place could arguably be shown have saved the county millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=320)|
| 0:05:29| And as Chief of Staff and representing the mayor tonight with these comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| I wanted to rise to publicly declare that these two men will be missed, they will be missed dearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| but I wanted to express mine and the mayor's sentiments along with the rest of our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| and just thank them for the service that they have provided during their careers at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| and I wanted to yield the remainder of my time to Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| Thank you so much, Mr. Hare, and that is quite a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Both of these gentlemen have been mentors to many, a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| I'll make a couple of comments about Mark Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| It's a rare leader that you can see come in and be a leader in a department such as the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| When you look at the impact that he's had on our HR and benefits team, as well as our risk management department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| and every one of those entities that Mark came into, he made better because of his leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| So they will be sorely missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| And you just look at what he's done for our insurance programs, if you look at bringing workers' comp back in-house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| updating our TDOT licensing and our drug testing programs, cyber risk policy, so many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| And also just building better relationships throughout the county because guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| Mark Jones is the kind of person that people actually like to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| And he is, in my personal and professional encounters with him, he's a counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| And that's going to be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| I also want to thank, when you think of Colonel Julian, that's another good example of a Cornington guy done good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=416)|
| 0:07:05| If you think about his-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Let's keep the comments appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Okay, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| But if you look at his long, lengthy military service and then coming in to be another leader in our HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| a steadying force, a calm, serene counselor for Knox County leaders, we're very lucky to have had both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=439)|
| 0:07:28| So I guess I'd like to ask my peers if you'd like to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| And then I also want to encourage all of us to give them each a standing round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| But I'll recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Well, that was kind of one in the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Since you're their boss for the next four days, can you mandate that they come down to the podium so that we can see them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| Colonel, you're not packing, are you, Colonel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| You guys, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Colonel Mark, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Mark was very clear he did not want any fanfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| Well, he's been ordered to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=482)|
| 0:08:10| I didn't lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Hey, Chris Caldwell, take a look at that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| But I just said, Colonel, before this meeting, I said, are you trying to take Chris Caldwell over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| Look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Look at that, Colonel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| Well, gentlemen, we're grateful for your service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| We're grateful to both of you for being calm counselors to so many other Knoxville and Knox County leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| that have been better leaders because of the counsel that you have provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| And good luck, and we wish you Godspeed in retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=521)|

| 0:12:24| But most importantly, they had the right to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| ICE destroys lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Just last year in Morristown, nearly 100 families lost a loved one after ICE raided a slaughterhouse in Granger County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=750)|
| 0:12:38| because the owner was polluting a local water source and evading taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| But rather than paying for his crimes, 100 families paid the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| And let me just clear up one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| These people aren't criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| They're not here to do us any harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| In fact, many of them are here because of what we have done in their countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| because Reagan funded civil wars that killed entire indigenous towns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| leaving hundreds of thousands of people without a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| And because during the Clinton administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| they began deporting people en masse from the most dangerous prisons in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| without notifying the Salvadoran government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| And so there's mass violence and gang violence there because of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| Or when in 2009 Hillary Clinton and President Obama immediately recognized a right-wing dictator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| who overthrew the democratically elected government in Honduras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| Or because of our emissions, we are fueling climate change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| which is destabilizing rural Central America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| And that's why many are coming right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| because of all these factors that we have added to the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| ICE is a terrorist organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| ICE detention centers are concentration camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| And we have a choice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| We must decide whether we will be complicit by funding an aggressive police force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| who goes after our undocumented community using 287G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| or we can decide to stand up and fight back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=851)|

| 0:14:45| According to a conservative estimate, in the past 17 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| the Knox County Commission has increased the county's policing budget by 112%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| Under the voluntary 287G program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| which Sheriff Tom Spangler renewed a little over two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| Knox County police officers can act on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| or ICE officers, to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| In 2003, Knox County's public safety budget was $44 million, and 36 of the total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=919)|
| 0:15:27| In the past 17 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| the Knox County Commission has steadily voted to increase the policing budget for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| for far more than what is necessary to keep its people safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| The Knox County Commission's 2020 budget for public safety is $93.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=940)|
| 0:15:48| a $6 million increase since last year, and a 112% increase since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=948)|
| 0:15:56| This means that policing composes 48% of the county's total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| This is money that could be spent on better equipment for our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| better and more affordable health care for its residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| and programs that will actually keep our communities safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| It is clear that the Knox County Commission's choice to increase spending on policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| has facilitated ICE activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| In less than a year, between September of 2017 and October of 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| the number of ICE detainees in Knox County increased dramatically from 18 people to 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| This is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| The Knox County Commission has consistently raised the budget for policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| directly contributing to the genocidal activity of ICE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| and in doing so has taken money from public services that support our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| such as health care, education, agriculture, and natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| The citizens and non-citizens of Knox County demand that the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| cut the county's policing budget back to the budget of 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| And Sheriff Spangler, since you are here, I'd like to add that we demand an end to 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| We are your constituents, and we deserve to be heard. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1038)|

| 0:17:42| Knox County Commission Board, whether or not you have realized it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| your decision to funnel money into policing and mass incarceration in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| makes you complicit in the inhumanity of prisons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| and particularly ICE concentration camps in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Your decisions about where our tax money goes have direct outcomes on real people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| human beings, people who it is your job to serve and create a peaceful community for in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| The 2020 general proposed budget shows that $93 million will go to policing or public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| while only $6 million will go to social and cultural recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| and only $22 million to public health and welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| Why is it that the county commissioner puts so much funding towards policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| when our community would benefit much more from increasing the amount of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| to health and welfare and recreation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| I know that the 2020-2021 budget has already been passed this past June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| but we demand that the funding for public safety, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| be reduced to the levels that they were at 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| Fact, increased policing does not reduce crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| Funding support for mental health, community welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| and support for low-income workers in protecting natural resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| is what will make Knoxville better and more equal for everyone who lives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| You are not directing money towards what our community wants and needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| You are funneling money towards a group that kills more people in the United States than any other group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| the police and now ICE, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| Now Knox County is doing the work of the federal government in the form of 287G agreement with ICE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| ICE is responsible for the concentration camps at the United States southern border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| These concentration camps, as my friends have stated, are inhumane, unhealthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| and at the very least, they are unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| Children and mothers are dying in these camps in ICE's custody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| in the federal government's custody, and children are being taken from their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| By funding policing, you are directly supporting these concentration camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| and police brutality in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| You are being complicit in racial profiling, torture, and violence in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1202)|

| 0:20:40| Is there anyone else who would like to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Okay. Moving on on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1245)|

| 0:20:56| vote on, and then move forward to next week's voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| Many of you had a chance to review the agenda online at the commissioner forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| I will go over everything for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| We will review everything that has been pulled from consent and a few other additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| The first addition is Commissioner Daly did add a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| I have already spoken to Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| We are going to plan on moving that discussion item to next week's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| and then try to push it through into tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you, Commissioner Daly, for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Commissioner Daly, do you want to give the highlight of that discussion item that we will be moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| I know it was on the forum. It was related to the license plates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| Yeah, real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| The state of Tennessee passed where a volunteer firefighter does not have to pay the state fee for their license plate for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1302)|
| 0:21:52| Anderson Blunt in Sevier County has already passed a resolution saying that the county portion of that tax can go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1312)|
| 0:22:01| That is what we will be discussing next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| That is about 12 volunteer firefighters, which is about $360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Another item, item 55, is going to be deferred to next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| The items that are officially pulled from consent in order of number are item 6, item 7, item 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1339)|

| 0:22:57| Can you have a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| In the back, there are people from public forum causing a disturbance in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| Sir, you haven't been recognized by the chair, so if there is any discussion that needs to take place, please move it on outside of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1388)|
| 0:23:25| Democracy is you've got to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| We're conducting our meeting, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| If you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1408)|
| 0:23:42| We'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| I had my head down here looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I'll review the first part quickly, and then I'll move into where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| Number 6, 7, 9, 25, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 47, 48, 49, 50, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1432)|
| 0:24:21| 61, 62, and additionally items 53 and 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| My apologies for not having them in direct order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| I thought on the forum there was also number 30 for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| I think Commissioner Daly asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Yes, and I've got that in my notebook here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| So that is item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| I have that circled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Yes, item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| 35 through 36, and 47 through 50, 38, 39, 40, 53, 54, and 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1489)|
| 0:25:07| So I think that covers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Is there any additional items that you all would like to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| 51, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Madam Clerk, could you make a note of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1516)|
| 0:25:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| All the other items that have not been discussed, I'm looking around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| I'm not seeing any additional lights, will remain on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| So I will now entertain a motion to approve the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| A motion has been made by Commissioner Carringer with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1544)|

| 0:25:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| First item on our agenda is item number five, which is approval of the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| That was quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| That was Commissioner Anders had the first, and I think it was Commissioner Schoonmaker I thought I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| but the second, or Smith, I heard it from over here, so Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Madam Clerk, next item, item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| This was, I'll go ahead and just read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| This was a consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| honoring Sandra Sexton upon the occasion of her retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| I'd like to just move with full commission to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| No recommendation, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| We have a motion to send forward no recommendation by Commissioner Carringer with a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Commissioner Carringer, thank you for even bringing this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| but I'd like to ask all the commissioners if they'd like to sign on as sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| On her to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| The question is Sandra who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| This is a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| We're really not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| So, for the record, the motion before us is to send forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| and with all of the county commissioners as the sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1637)|

| 0:27:23| We all are on as sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Is there a motion to send forward with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| No motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| I heard a motion by Commissioner Jay and a second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1655)|

| 0:27:38| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Madam Clerk, Item 8, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Number 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Number 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Item number 9 is Resolution 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| It's approving a memorandum of agreement between the Knox County Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| the Knoxville Police Department, and the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| addressing the roles and responsibilities of all three entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| as it relates to law enforcement presence in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| We have a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders and that was a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| I just need a quick clarification on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| When I read that, I wasn't sure if that was a new MOU or if that's the way it's always been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| but if you could kind of provide just a quick bit of insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| I think that was discussed at City Council, too, the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| It may have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| We entered into our first MOU between the Police Department and Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| and the school system in 2009, if I recall, and this one is not dissimilar from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| It builds on what we've learned over the last 10 or 11 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| and really defines responsibilities within the safety and security operation space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| because we all sort of bump into each other as we work in that, and it lays it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| And it makes it much more specific who's responsible for what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| It was really tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| I mean, good job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Is there any additional questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1747)|

| 0:29:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| We have a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders with a second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Tom, you've just got a couple of minutes on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| I guess I just have one kind of quick question after I read through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| In the past, had the state paid for 100% of all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| And is this something that they've kind of restructured to have us pay a little bit more for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| I didn't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Obviously, that's why we brought it to you last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| And that number, that $80,000, has come from an estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| because at that time when we came in front of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| we had a little over 800 people that were on the monitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| This month, we're a little over 900 already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| So those numbers can either continue to go up or either maybe come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| The motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| That was 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Item number 30, resolution 405.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| It's approving a utility easement for the Knoxville Utilities Board, KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| to obtain a permanent utility easement and temporary construction easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| on property located at 2625 Merrillville Pike and known as IC King Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| in the amount of $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| There's a motion for approval by Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| with a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Good to see you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Give me an update on utilities or the easement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| I know they've started to grade for the curb and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I get a lot of questions from the citizens wanting to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| So if you would, give me an update on what you think will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| I hate the project has drug on a little bit, but we did have significant utility relocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| To speak to this particular item, this body approved a utility easement for this project some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| That was for overhead electric and water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| KUB has since learned as part of the delay that they had a gas conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| So this easement essentially, the first easement was never recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| This will allow for a larger easement for all three of those facilities, gas, water, and electric to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| So that's what this easement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| However, this easement will not defer the project any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| AT&T had one pole in conflict that was actually relocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| and is out of conflict with us as of end of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| So weather permitting, we will be paving the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| and completing our part of the project within the next seven to ten days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| and then working with parks in regard to the opening of the park itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| But the roadway improvement should be done within the next week to two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Is there any additional questions related to this matter for Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| Jim, any time I have the opportunity to thank you for all the hard work your department does, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| Roads are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Don't worry. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Item number 35, resolution 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| It's approving a memorandum of understanding and agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| with the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee, CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| to provide $539,151 in 2019 community development block grant CDBG program funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2012)|
| 0:33:41| for administrative program costs in housing rehabilitation construction services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| for single-family owner-occupied low-income homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| federally funded through HUD CDBG program funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| My fellow commissioners, as you may have seen on the commissioners' forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| we have pulled multiple items that are related to these community development block grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| We'll probably have to pass each one of these individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| but I really wanted to create an opportunity for Dwight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| considering how many of these we have this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| to speak to this program in general and provide some insights to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| There's a few things that we talked about, Dwight, that were, frankly, pretty remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| So I thought I'd give you a chance to share the status of the program, some of the new things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| and then the chair will entertain, after your presentation, we can open up for any Q&A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| and then the chair will entertain motions by item to pass the remainders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| unless there's questions about one in particular, if that's pleasing to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| So, Dwight, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Chairman Dwight VandeVeet, 400 Main Avenue, suite 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| Hopefully all of you also got a short memorandum summarizing what we propose by way of contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2091)|
| 0:34:59| Commission actually approved this slate of agreements in the annual action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| that was previously approved by this body in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| These are the contracts that accompany that annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| and it's subsequently been approved by HUD as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Most of these will look familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| CAC is our primary partner in community development block grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| and they do really remarkable work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| They're our largest sub-recipient at over half a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| and they provide emergency home repairs, typically roof repairs and HVAC repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| anything that might render a home uninhabitable for families of low to moderate income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| Most of the time they are very much on the low side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| The other programs will look relatively familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Two I'll speak to briefly, and then I'll be glad to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| One in particular is a contract with Florence Crittenton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| who came to us with a proposal for shelter beds for minor victims of human trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| One of the things we learned this year is that in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| there are currently four beds for victims of human trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| Those are four beds for adult victims, and they have been occupied since they have been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| Florence Crittenton came to us with an excellent proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| where they had significant money in excess of $200,000 in capital funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| and needed about another $100,000 to bring this project to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| And so we created room to fund it, and we're really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| It will expand the number of shelter beds for victims of human trafficking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| in this case minor victims, somewhere between eight and ten beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| depending on their construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Chairman Nystrom had asked me what I think is a very good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| and so I'll address that to the body, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| were they prepared from an operating cost standpoint to fund this, and they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| They have state revenues that are on deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| along with some contractual service revenues that will support their operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| So they had most of the capital they needed, and they had a revenue stream to run the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| and we were able to, in essence, close this gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| and make this facility a reality sooner than it would have otherwise been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| We're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| This is a space we haven't worked before, but we think that there is a great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| We also hope in the next couple of years to work with the Coalition Against Human Trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| One of the other programs we're excited about is considerably smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| but it's actually down in item 40 under our public service agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| NHI, Neighborhood Housing Incorporated, has been a great sub-recipient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| a great partner to Knox County for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| They have had a program, a workforce development program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| that operates out of city schools where they will identify youth who have not graduated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| did not graduate and have not finished school, who are either unemployed or underemployed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| and they recruit them, in effect, into a training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| where they're able to obtain entry-level certifications in certain construction trades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| framing, masonry, and related construction trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| They have a very holistic approach where they work with the kids on basics of interview skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| They help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| They will take them, if necessary, to CARM and get them clothes that are appropriate for an interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| They will equip them with the basic hand tools, depending on which program they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| Upon completion of the program, they actually earn a recognized certification in their particular trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| They have employers that they work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| and if an employer calls them and says a certain young man didn't show up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| they'll even go up and knock on his door and tell him to put down the Xbox controller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| It's time to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| Really great program, very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| It had not existed in the county schools, and we were able to create some room for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| and we're excited about it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Those are a couple new areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| Everything else should look relatively familiar to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| as these are sub-recipients that we have historically had some relationship with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| Mr. Chairman, I hope that's consistent with what you were looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| and I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| I want to check with my fellow commissioners if you've got any other questions for Dwight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| regarding these block grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Okay, seeing none, we have one, two, three, four, five, six of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| I'm going to ask Mr. Law Director, I'm guessing we're probably going to have to send each one forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| pass each one individually rather than one block for a bunch of block grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Or is it possible to have a motion that would send forward items 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, and 40 in one motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2366)|
| 0:39:36| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| So the chair will entertain a motion to send forward item 35 for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2385)|

| 0:43:33| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Next item is number 47, resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| It's approving an agreement of sale in the amount of $265 with Fred Weaver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| for delinquent tax surplus property located at 0 Bluebell Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Okay, we have a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| Ben, are you excited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| Ben, I spoke with you this week and wanted to get kind of just a brief update on how this sale went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| and just how is it compared briefly to some of our past sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| I know that this brought about $200,000 to the county, which we appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| So if you could give just kind of a brief update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| especially on how maybe this is compared in the past without going great deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| but just you know what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Ben Charvel, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| We have, we did, okay, we only had 37 properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| and these are the properties that the county acquires via the tax sale that nobody else bids on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| We try to have, we usually have a sale about a year, a little over a year past every,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| after every tax sale because of a one-year redemption period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| We only had 37 properties this time, which is a lower amount than we've ever had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| but that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| That means people are purchasing property at the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| We made $212,565 in the auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| Some of that will go to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| It's yet to be determined the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| It hasn't been figured yet for their portion of the property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| On average, we made almost $6,000 of property, $5,745 to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| And even though we didn't make as much, the most we've ever made is almost $400,000 per property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| That's the second most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| This is the sixth sale or fifth sale that I've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| and average per property over those last five years or so is about $4,000, and we made $57,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| We've increased the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| The more we do this, the more the word gets out, the more we seem to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| That's a good trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| Sir, you keep talking about the average sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Were there any properties that sold for less than the tax bill owed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| I haven't figured that, but the majority of these sell for less than the tax bill owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| That's the purpose of this process because the tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| the price starts at the taxes, penalties, and interest due to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| For those properties that are within the city limits, how is this split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| Is there a formula?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| It's based on the amount of taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| The trustee's office actually calculates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| If the county is owed $6,000 and the city is owed $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| they calculate it based on that percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| They formulate it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| If we get $5,000, then they'll get whatever that same percentage is that's owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| The trustee's office handles that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Is there any additional questions pertaining to this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Regarding item 47, it is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2809)|

| 0:49:48| I don't have a copy of the budget with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| but of all the defined services contracts that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| in the approved fiscal 20 budget that is now currently active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| what would you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Is this about half or two-thirds or a third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| I mean, there's several more to come, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Ben, how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| He's the one who sends these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| This is not a full and complete is, I guess, my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3010)|

| 0:50:26| So that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| So this is the third that you'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| You won't get any more because the others are less than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| $100,000 that are required for commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| So they're in the budget document that's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| and the others are below the threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| And those are not put on spreader record or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Good question, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| This motion, is there any other discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Item 53, Resolution 901,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| is to approve various amendments to the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Rules, as shown on the attached Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| The Chair will entertain a motion from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| We met today and had some discussion on the final wording of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| these documents, and what we, in the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| I guess, Randy, you want to explain it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| You've got it right there in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| Do we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| The Chair recognizes Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| We've met two times now and have ironed through some that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| believe we're ready to vote on as they stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| and then we have two that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| and I guess we could just pass all these without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| and get them all worded out to everybody correctly for next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| The two that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| and you're going to have to help me with one, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| because I can only remember the Section C one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Well, we're going to change the devotion to five minutes instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| three minutes, and then you had a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| On the Section C, where it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| the Chair shall have the discretion to move items on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| agenda for efficiency purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| I think we all agree that this is a good move to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| there's times in the meetings that things have to be changed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| efficiency because people have things that they need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| but in thinking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| I believe it's a little bit too broad and gives too much power and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| discretion to the Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| So I would like to substitute for our regular meeting that's coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| up the following language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| After the agenda has been set by the Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| the Chair may, without objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| move items on the agenda for efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| If there's an objection, a vote shall be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| I want to let you all know I actually came to the Rules Committee at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| the past meeting to bring that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| We had a couple of situations where we've had, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| resolutions where we've recognized people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| yet we hadn't actually even had the resolution added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| so we wanted to tweak that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| We also had an evening where we had a lot of kids here that we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| to thank and recognize, yet with our agenda we had some forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| speakers that took a lot of time and it just didn't quite feel right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| and I know it wasn't efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| So I wanted to, while I know as Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| myself or whoever our future Chairs are and our past Chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| we've always tried to tweak things a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| but I wanted to maybe make it a little bit more formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| I know most Chairs try to really be rigid and follow the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| established by our Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| but I also wanted to maybe put it in writing that under special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| circumstances the Chair may want to try to adjust meetings based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| for efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| I want to make a motion that we send these forward as amended without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| You'll get a copy of them the next day or so from Jill and make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| decision on them next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Okay, so we have a motion to send forward with no recommendation from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| I'll look to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Yes, I want to check with the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Will these be coming to us individually or will we vote these in block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Because I didn't see it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| It broke down into individual votes on each rule change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| You can do them however you want to resolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| You can make a motion to separate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| You can vote on them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| It's up to this body how you want to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| I think there's three or four issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| I think only two will come before them, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| This one is clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| The one we were just talking about, the setting of the agenda, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| clean except for it needs to be amended, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| But the other thing that we talked about in removing someone from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| committee, that's not cleaned up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| That's not even been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| It's not even been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| What was the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Was it just those two things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Well, there's this list that we went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| There's the Pledge of Allegiance, the movement of where the amendments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| the agenda falls within the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| I think that's easy to vote on as a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Devotional and public forum employees only have to give, say they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| employees of Knox County, give their first and last name, title, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| department name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| And then we had chairman's discretion to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| We want to leave these all together with those two amendments to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| time given for devotional and the language on chairman's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| If anybody wants to change on Monday, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| Sounds pretty clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| That motion to send forward with no recommendation is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| Seeing no lights for additional discussion, all in favor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| Item 54, Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| It's regarding an application for tax increment finance in TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| bought with the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| by Grassy Creek LLC for approximately 30 acres located around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| intersection of Oak Ridge Highway and Chad Row, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| I've got two lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Point of question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| If we vote on this, can it go on consent or does it have to be voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| It has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| We have a motion to send forward with no recommendation by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Anders and a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| Is there any discussion or would we prefer to move all the discussion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| No, we can discuss it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| I think it's pretty clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| It's pretty clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Well, I just wanted to thank Jim Snowden and the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| and also the applicant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| This has been a long process and this wouldn't be before us if we didn't ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| them to make several changes engineering-wise to this and create some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| road that we didn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| And so I came from being on the fence to being for it because the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| is asking them to do some things engineering-wise that really they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| wouldn't have to do if we didn't ask them for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| So I commend everybody for working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| It's been probably 18 months in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| So thank you guys for getting it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| I think also on this project we're basically getting a county road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| and that is what the TIF is to pay back for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| It's the cost of building that road and some utilities they're bringing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| It's also a very good project, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| We're going to see sales tax dollars generated from this in a place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| was generating nothing but very little property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| So, Mr. Maddox, I thank you for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3482)|

| 0:59:35| In reading through this, it's quite obvious that this is a pilot I like, one that brings in jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| And this is one that has the potential to bring in another approximately 225 good-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| I like everything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3589)|

| 0:59:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| What we're going to do is set the term of the pilot at the purchase price, as we discussed earlier last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3597)|
| 1:00:05| that they pay rather than the present price, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3609)|

| 1:00:34| I spoke with Joe and Bill and the team from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| Good work on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3638)|

| 1:04:11| I look forward to a productive retreat that John Schoonmaker is yelling at me about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3851)|
| 1:04:19| Do you have an updated agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| The agenda is the same as it was before, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| I think that we tweaked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| We added the planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Was that on the original agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| I'm not sure, but I'll send out an updated agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| 26th and 27th, Friday the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| Sorry, my plane got in at about 3 a.m. last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| Anyway, it's all set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| I'm looking forward to everybody's participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3885)|

| 1:04:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Next item, Madam Clerk, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Item 61, discussion item to receive an update from the Tennessee County Services Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| TCSA Transportation Committee Secretary, Commissioner Charles Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| I watched everybody give their reports last week at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| and I felt left out with not having my transportation committee said, so that's why I added it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| One of the things I wanted to mention about transportation was, and it's very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| we get all of our money from gas taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| We get it from license plates, driver's license, and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| And I've talked to different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Some I've listened to them talk, Ted Russell being one of the people I listen to give a report on cars in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3933)|
| 1:05:41| And he's talking about in the future you'll probably order a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| You'll just say it's a Google or an Amazon car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| It will come to your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| You program it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| It takes you where you want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| It comes back, lets you out, and the way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| And so you'll be owning no cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| You won't have driver's license, and you won't have license plates you pay for, and using no gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| These things are in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| And I know government is more reactive than proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| But all of our roads are upkept off of gas taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| And that will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| So we've got to look at ways of raising monies to keep these roads and infrastructure up to use these new fangled cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3977)|
| 1:06:25| and things that will be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| And it's moving fairly rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| I think Volkswagen said by, was it 2022 or 20 something like that, 50% of their cars that they manufacture will be electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3989)|
| 1:06:38| So anyway, I just want to let you know that I was elected the secretary to this body of TCSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=3998)|
| 1:06:48| and hopefully I can work up to maybe being chairman of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| It's one of the last things I do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| But I just wanted to mention that to you about all these things that we get taxes from that's going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| And somewhere down the line, we're going to have to make some sort of decision how we're going to raise that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| So anyway, that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Just to clarify, I think you have the initials wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| It's the TCCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Not the TCSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| I was reading it off of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Can I blame Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Because that would be awesome if you could pull that one off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| I hope Drew's not listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| I'll blame Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| No, I'm just teasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Thank you, Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| I've been to a lot of those meetings myself, and we appreciate you taking a leadership role on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| It is pretty interesting when you see the electric cars, and something's going to have to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| I mean, we're going to have to find – it's not about taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| It's about maintaining the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| I'll go ahead and just recognize Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| You've got the second item on the agenda, the TriStar Classic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| The TriStar Classic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Let me give you some information about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| I'm on the Three Ridges Green Committee that you all appointed me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| and I've seen how we can raise money through using that asset that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| Last year we started the TriStar event, which you bring in a professional golfer and brings in three of their best juniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| Last year, without any advertisement and things like that at all, we had 43 participants and 10 pros show up in 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| This year we had 85 participants and 21 pros show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| Sixty-three kids came to Knoxville, and they spent the night, three nights here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| Now, where did these kids come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| They came from Jackson, Nashville, Chattanooga, Tri-Cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| And so they're coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Next year we hope that it will double again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| Hopefully we'll have somewhere in the neighborhood of about 160 or 170 participants and a lot more pros here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| And I want to thank the mayor for his donating some funds to help get the pros here, and that does ag them on a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4140)|
| 1:09:09| Now, let me tell you what this has gone to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| We heard the 41 chapters of the TGA, Tennessee Golf Association, throughout the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4152)|
| 1:09:23| This is the only kind of tournament like this in the whole country, the way that we run that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4163)|
| 1:09:31| Now, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| They've really taken it over, and the PGA is looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| They want to take this nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| But guess what we've done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| We've got it here in Knox County and chartered in Knox County, which means if they go nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| the big tournament, which all the country will be in, will have to be here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| So that will bring even more people in here, maybe for a whole week, for this kind of tournament going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| So we're looking at maybe a million, $2 million worth of tax revenue coming in when that finally hits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| But they're going to take it nationally from this one tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| So we have this asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| We have people out there working with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| And just think what kind of money this will bring in for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| And just last week we had two tournaments out there, and I think what I found out about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| what they took in out there was nearly $20,000 for just two days that they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4225)|
| 1:10:34| So we're trying to get that up and bring in where it will be self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| But not being self-sufficient, it does bring people in here to spend money and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| So I want to thank you all for letting me be part of that Greens Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| We're still working at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| And hopefully we'll have that national tournament here before I get out of office in three years and one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| So anyway, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| All right. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Once again, we did have that one item that Commissioner Daley brought in for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| but we did agree to go ahead and move to next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| I'll go ahead and recognize Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| I just have one quick note I wanted to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| Back in February we were presented a report from CTAS, Knox County Fire and Rescue Evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| We were given a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| I think everybody agreed in principle that it was too short a time for such a big topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| And so we all sort of agreed, you know, we would chew on it and read it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| and then spend some time maybe later this summer or into the fall to really discuss it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| Soon after that, I asked each of the referencing organizations to send a response to that report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4297)|
| 1:11:46| since they were named and, you know, obviously there was a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| That included Rural Metro, Volunteer Rescue Squad, Seymour Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| Volunteer Fire Department and Carnes Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| All of which have responded and I will bundle those responses up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| and send them out to everybody in a public way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| And then I would just encourage our chair and body here to take that up in maybe a chairman's briefing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| or something where we could dedicate several hours, bring in everybody to have a much more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| robust discussion and have some time to really process both their response and a long-term discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| and don't just let a report, you know, die on a shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| So I will send those out here this week and I hope that we will take it up maybe later in the summer or early fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| I left one thing off of my golf report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| Friday the 19th, we're going to have the starter tournament for LPGA come in here sponsored by Eglins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4362)|
| 1:12:53| They will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| We've already got some, that is the major sponsor that takes care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| But if we do well for three years, they said they would take a look at Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| and Three Ridges as a place for a regular LPGA stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| So hopefully this weekend we make a favorable impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| Then the next year and the next year, then we'll get that to come in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| And we're bringing a lot of young ladies that play golf out there to watch these ladies play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| And let me tell you, they can hit the ball better than I've ever seen in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| And they really tested my male ego a lot playing with those ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| And I appreciate, again, letting me be part of that Three Ridges Greens Committee out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Madam Clerk, we'll move to announcements in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| But, Madam Clerk, I want to verify, is there any additional items for discussion on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| Okay, I'll lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4429)|

| 1:13:52| And this is about swimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| The Knoxville JICAISA, if you're wondering what JICAISA is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| that is the Greater Knoxville Area Inter-Club Swimming Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| If any of y'all have had kids that do, quote, the city swim meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| there's thousands of kids and teams are swimming in this city final swim meet from every one of our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4448)|

| 1:14:19| It's that Thursday, Friday, Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Thousands of kids from every part of our community and counties outside of Knox County will be right here in Knoxville swimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| If any of you would like to purchase an ad or just a thank you from Good Luck Swimmers from Commissioner ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4469)|
| 1:14:37| I'll be sending out an email with information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| And in full disclosure, my wife is president of JICAISA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| So I wanted to make sure that I shared this just in the event that she's watching tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| So she probably isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| But anyhow, it's a whole lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| So anyhow, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Additional announcements, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| Yeah, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| I don't know if you guys have seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| If not, I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| The family of Pierce Corcoran is having a golf tournament to benefit Emerald Youth Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| It's August the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| If you can put a team or sponsor a hole, you can Google Emerald Youth or Pierce Corcoran Golf Tournament and do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| I'm going to be playing in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| Just great cause with a great family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| It's just something to help them continue celebrating Pierce and also missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| So if you can get out there or if nothing else, sponsor a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| I think it's $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| It's a great cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| And all the money I think benefits this year to Emerald Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4544)|

| 1:16:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| I just want to keep in the forefront of us that the state conference is in October and that we just don't want that to fall off our plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| which is in a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| I'm not sure if we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4581)|

| 1:16:26| The chair will entertain a motion for dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| We are dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190715?start=4598)|
