| 0:01:29| All right, let's get into our presentation first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=89.0)|
| 0:01:31| I want to welcome Mayor Kincannon for joining us this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=91.0)|
| 0:01:35| and she's going to give us an introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=95.0)|
| 0:01:37| I wanted to take a quick moment, Mayor, and wish you a happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=97.0)|
| 0:01:44| Happy birthday, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=104.0)|
| 0:01:47| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=107.0)|
| 0:01:49| I'm really pleased to be here on my birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=109.0)|
| 0:01:52| Well, welcome, and I know you wanted to get us started off with some introductory remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=112.0)|
| 0:01:59| Yes, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=119.0)|
| 0:02:01| It is a beautiful day here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=121.0)|
| 0:02:02| and I had the opportunity to join about 60 other people at the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=122.0)|
| 0:02:10| where the Opticos team gave this presentation to people at that meeting and a lot of real estate professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=130.0)|
| 0:02:17| and it was great to hear their questions and input and thoughts and reactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=137.0)|
| 0:02:22| And so I'm really glad that they're going to be here today to present to all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=142.0)|
| 0:02:27| because the missing middle housing is something that I've been thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=147.0)|
| 0:02:32| and think that, you know, we have a housing crisis in our city, and we need more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=152.0)|
| 0:02:38| And sometimes what's old is new again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=158.0)|
| 0:02:41| and sometimes the solutions that were the way housing was done in the past can be something that we look at as a model for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=161.0)|
| 0:02:49| as we move forward and think about ways to address this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=169.0)|
| 0:02:52| So I look forward to ‑‑ I'm not going to be able to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=172.0)|
| 0:02:55| I'm going to launch the Big Ears Festival in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=175.0)|
| 0:03:00| but I do think that you're going to be inspired and have a lot of questions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=180.0)|
| 0:03:07| and I am committed to learning from the community, learning from all of you, and moving forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=187.0)|
| 0:03:13| but in a way where we just do it in a really smart, strategic way that is with the support of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=193.0)|
| 0:03:21| And I'm confident that if we, you know, listen and learn and do it, it's going to be a key, one of many strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=201.0)|
| 0:03:31| As you guys know, we've been doing many efforts on the housing front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=211.0)|
| 0:03:35| and you guys have just been really leading that effort in a budgetary way, in a policy way, in shaping that agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=215.0)|
| 0:03:41| and this is just one other strategy that can help us address this housing supply issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=221.0)|
| 0:03:46| So thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=226.0)|
| 0:03:49| This is just the first of many discussions on this, and I look forward to your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=229.0)|
| 0:03:55| Thank you so much for joining us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=235.0)|
| 0:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=237.0)|
| 0:03:59| Now we'll move over to our presentation, and we have Tony Perez with us with Optikos Design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=239.0)|
| 0:04:09| and welcome, Mr. Perez, and we're looking forward to the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=249.0)|
| 0:04:13| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=253.0)|
| 0:04:15| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=255.0)|
| 0:04:16| Can everybody hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=256.0)|
| 0:04:19| That's over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=259.0)|
| 0:04:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=260.0)|
| 0:04:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=261.0)|
| 0:04:22| Can everybody hear me fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=262.0)|
| 0:04:24| A little April Fool's joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=264.0)|
| 0:04:26| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=266.0)|
| 0:04:27| I believe that's in two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=267.0)|
| 0:04:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=269.0)|
| 0:04:30| I'm going to try to speak into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=270.0)|
| 0:04:32| It looks like I have to lean in a little bit to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=272.0)|
| 0:04:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=275.0)|
| 0:04:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=276.0)|
| 0:04:37| Well, first of all, thank you very much for having us here at Optikos Design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=277.0)|
| 0:04:42| invited to the city to present on this, and just to remind everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=282.0)|
| 0:04:46| we prepared an analysis that we'll talk about here in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=286.0)|
| 0:04:52| We prepared it last September, and it's called the Missing Middle Scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=292.0)|
| 0:04:55| It's one of the services we provide, so that's how we became involved with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=295.0)|
| 0:05:00| So today's presentation, we're going to talk about what is missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=300.0)|
| 0:05:08| why is it needed, what are the barriers and some best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=308.0)|
| 0:05:13| what are the opportunities here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=313.0)|
| 0:05:15| what do we recommend that you get started to do to implement missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=315.0)|
| 0:05:20| and then your questions and discussions, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=320.0)|
| 0:05:24| The idea of missing middle can be summed up into this one liner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=324.0)|
| 0:05:29| house-scale buildings with multiple units in walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=329.0)|
| 0:05:33| And the really interesting thing about this phrase is that regular apartment development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=333.0)|
| 0:05:39| which is good and has its purpose, can be one or two of these, sometimes all three of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=339.0)|
| 0:05:47| but missing middle is always all three of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=347.0)|
| 0:05:50| house-scale buildings with multiple units in walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=350.0)|
| 0:05:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=354.0)|
| 0:05:55| And it's missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=355.0)|
| 0:05:56| We call it missing because, as you may or may not know, over the past 80 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=356.0)|
| 0:06:02| the emphasis has been on building houses and building townhouses more recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=362.0)|
| 0:06:10| and then building apartments, big apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=370.0)|
| 0:06:13| And so the term missing means that there's a whole spectrum of housing choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=373.0)|
| 0:06:17| and that middle portion of the spectrum has been missing for the past 80 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=377.0)|
| 0:06:22| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=382.0)|
| 0:06:23| And, again, this isn't new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=383.0)|
| 0:06:25| This is something actually you have here in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=385.0)|
| 0:06:29| The Sears houses, for example, that are all over the country from east to west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=389.0)|
| 0:06:35| were ordered out of a catalog, and here's an example of one of those pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=395.0)|
| 0:06:39| And my understanding is one of those architects actually worked in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=399.0)|
| 0:06:43| or was from Knoxville, Mr. Barber, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=403.0)|
| 0:06:46| So those houses, you could order them from a catalog like here on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=406.0)|
| 0:06:51| And one of the interesting things about that is that if you see the little arrows there on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=411.0)|
| 0:06:56| you can't see the text, but what they're pointing to is it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=416.0)|
| 0:06:59| this building fits on a lot 40 feet wide or this building fits on a lot 50 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=419.0)|
| 0:07:05| And unlike a lot of the zoning processes that we've all become accustomed to across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=425.0)|
| 0:07:11| where you need all this special review and variances and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=431.0)|
| 0:07:15| they were making these to fit lots that existed in neighborhoods 100 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=435.0)|
| 0:07:20| So there wasn't any mystery to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=440.0)|
| 0:07:22| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=442.0)|
| 0:07:23| So we're going to talk about this palette of missing middle types, and it has different names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=443.0)|
| 0:07:28| Each of them have different names depending on where you are in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=448.0)|
| 0:07:32| But there are eight to ten depending on, you know, how you slice them, how you name them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=452.0)|
| 0:07:40| And we've categorized them into small and medium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=460.0)|
| 0:07:44| and then there's this category large that I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=464.0)|
| 0:07:47| So we'll get into this next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=467.0)|
| 0:07:50| But also just quickly, the whole spectrum that we're going to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=470.0)|
| 0:07:54| it's not intended as all of it needs to happen every place you do missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=474.0)|
| 0:07:59| Rather, maybe the small portion of the spectrum works in one neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=479.0)|
| 0:08:03| and the medium works in another, and maybe a portion of the medium works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=483.0)|
| 0:08:07| It's divisible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=487.0)|
| 0:08:09| It's not intended that you apply it full strength everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=489.0)|
| 0:08:13| So the first one is duplex side-by-side, and I've seen several of these here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=493.0)|
| 0:08:18| and as the name suggests, there are two units side-by-side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=498.0)|
| 0:08:21| But unlike two big houses that could be glued together and provide two big houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=501.0)|
| 0:08:27| and be called a duplex, the missing middle version of the duplex is, remember, house scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=507.0)|
| 0:08:33| It's the size of houses in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=513.0)|
| 0:08:35| and so both of those units fit inside the scale of what would otherwise be one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=515.0)|
| 0:08:41| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=521.0)|
| 0:08:42| The duplex stack is its cousin, and it's narrower because it's not side-by-side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=522.0)|
| 0:08:48| It's able to fit on a narrower lot, and it's one flat on top of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=528.0)|
| 0:08:53| I want to call your attention to the bottom right portion of that yellow banner that's on each slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=533.0)|
| 0:08:58| and you'll see that in addition to the lot size characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=538.0)|
| 0:09:02| that may or may not be readable at this scale, these examples were measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=542.0)|
| 0:09:08| And whatever those measurements were, so, for example, 50 by 130, 50-foot wide lot by 130 feet deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=548.0)|
| 0:09:17| that equals a certain density when you multiply out the two units on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=557.0)|
| 0:09:21| In this case, the ones we measured are 13 to 25 to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=561.0)|
| 0:09:26| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=566.0)|
| 0:09:28| The cottage court, we're moving up the spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=568.0)|
| 0:09:30| We're still at the small end of the scale of the missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=570.0)|
| 0:09:33| Cottage court is, as its name suggests, a series of cottages that are detached from each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=573.0)|
| 0:09:40| and they're usually one story, and they're arranged around a garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=580.0)|
| 0:09:43| and often, but not always, there's a two-story cottage at the end of the garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=583.0)|
| 0:09:48| as you can see in this example, and sometimes that building has two units, maybe three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=588.0)|
| 0:09:53| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=593.0)|
| 0:09:55| And then the triplex fourplex, which you have several examples here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=595.0)|
| 0:09:59| and you can see that number again in the bottom right of that banner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=599.0)|
| 0:10:02| Here, these examples range from 24 to the acre to 29 to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=602.0)|
| 0:10:07| and I want to call your attention to that number, these density numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=607.0)|
| 0:10:10| because I think we've been accustomed to or trained by our experiences across the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=610.0)|
| 0:10:17| that density, the lower the number, the better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=617.0)|
| 0:10:20| and so when you do the math on some of these missing middle types, it's just a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=620.0)|
| 0:10:25| You measure it, and it comes out to be these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=625.0)|
| 0:10:27| It often doesn't jive with the zoning system that cities have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=627.0)|
| 0:10:33| and that's because it precedes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=633.0)|
| 0:10:35| So I just want to call that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=635.0)|
| 0:10:38| But going up the scale a little more, now we're at the medium portion of that spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=638.0)|
| 0:10:43| and this is what is often called a mansion apartment in many communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=643.0)|
| 0:10:47| or what we call it a multiplex medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=647.0)|
| 0:10:50| And you first look at it like I did in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, this example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=650.0)|
| 0:10:54| and I thought, wow, that's a beautiful house, and the guides told me, no, that's five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=654.0)|
| 0:10:59| And so I said, oh, that's a mansion apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=659.0)|
| 0:11:01| And so you look at it, and it just fits in with all the other houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=661.0)|
| 0:11:05| Again, that house scale characteristic of missing middle is super important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=665.0)|
| 0:11:10| because the second you stop making them house scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=670.0)|
| 0:11:13| it's hard to make the case that they can fit into neighborhoods of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=673.0)|
| 0:11:17| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=677.0)|
| 0:11:19| And then this one, going up the scale or spectrum again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=679.0)|
| 0:11:22| this is the courtyard where the cottage court was these detached one-story cottages around a garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=682.0)|
| 0:11:29| The courtyard is its cousin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=689.0)|
| 0:11:31| It attaches the cottages and makes them two stories around a garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=691.0)|
| 0:11:35| and all the entrances face it, and the garden is open to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=695.0)|
| 0:11:39| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=699.0)|
| 0:11:41| And then lastly, the townhouse, and the townhouse comes in a few varieties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=701.0)|
| 0:11:46| sometimes three to four in a row, two stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=706.0)|
| 0:11:49| and in this case, this one is a little longer, five or six in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=709.0)|
| 0:11:53| depending on where you are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=713.0)|
| 0:11:55| And then one more here, the three-story version of the mansion apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=715.0)|
| 0:12:01| I put this one in here to show that everything up until this point was small or medium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=721.0)|
| 0:12:07| and this is when you get into the large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=727.0)|
| 0:12:09| and you have really beautiful examples of the large missing middle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=729.0)|
| 0:12:13| They're the three-story brick buildings on the busier streets here in the center of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=733.0)|
| 0:12:18| with the balconies on the third, second, and the porches on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=738.0)|
| 0:12:24| And it's really important to know that the large, when we say missing middle and we just talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=744.0)|
| 0:12:31| we're talking about the small and medium, and the large is an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=751.0)|
| 0:12:34| It has its place, but it's not what we tend to mean when we talk about missing middle in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=754.0)|
| 0:12:41| because this doesn't fit in all neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=761.0)|
| 0:12:44| All the other ones do fit in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=764.0)|
| 0:12:47| And look at the, just before we leave it, look at the density in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=767.0)|
| 0:12:51| It's 12 units in each of them, so four units per floor, 12 units in each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=771.0)|
| 0:12:57| and the density is 50 to 57 to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=777.0)|
| 0:13:00| They're beautiful buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=780.0)|
| 0:13:01| They're actually about, I want to say, 10 to 15 years old in Athens, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=781.0)|
| 0:13:07| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=787.0)|
| 0:13:08| So I'm going to show you some examples of applying these ideas besides the project I just showed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=788.0)|
| 0:13:14| projects that we have worked on to build missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=794.0)|
| 0:13:18| First one is here in California on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=798.0)|
| 0:13:21| It's 12 cottages around a garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=801.0)|
| 0:13:25| It's the cottage court type, and this cottage court is a result of a process with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=805.0)|
| 0:13:32| and the neighbors that the developer went through, and the zoning rules didn't allow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=812.0)|
| 0:13:37| and so they went through this process and arrived at this design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=817.0)|
| 0:13:41| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=821.0)|
| 0:13:43| This one is a version of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=823.0)|
| 0:13:44| It's also around a garden, a much more constrained parcel in Seattle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=824.0)|
| 0:13:49| and it's eight cottages with four accessory dwelling units around that garden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=829.0)|
| 0:13:55| for a total of 12 units on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=835.0)|
| 0:13:59| And then in West Village, Florence, Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=839.0)|
| 0:14:02| we are currently working on a project that includes four courtyard buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=842.0)|
| 0:14:06| and several mixed-use buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=846.0)|
| 0:14:08| You can see the site plan there on the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=848.0)|
| 0:14:11| and the courtyard there on the main part of the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=851.0)|
| 0:14:14| The buildings are arranged in a courtyard fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=854.0)|
| 0:14:16| with this shared courtyard in the middle of all the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=856.0)|
| 0:14:20| This one is a version of a townhouse in South Jordan, Utah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=860.0)|
| 0:14:25| and a big master plan community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=865.0)|
| 0:14:27| If you go to the next slide, yeah, this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=867.0)|
| 0:14:30| So you can see the colored buildings, the blue, yellow, and red there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=870.0)|
| 0:14:34| That's the project, and it was in this remnant piece of a block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=874.0)|
| 0:14:38| that the developer had left over between these buildings that they developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=878.0)|
| 0:14:43| and they approached us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=883.0)|
| 0:14:45| We need something to go into this swath of land that we don't want to waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=885.0)|
| 0:14:49| What could we do with such a narrow strip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=889.0)|
| 0:14:52| And so the office took the townhouse and turned it on its side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=892.0)|
| 0:14:57| so that the long end is along this pedestrian muse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=897.0)|
| 0:15:00| And so Dan Parolek gave the name Muse Townhouse to this missing middle type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=900.0)|
| 0:15:07| And one of the features here is that because of the way this was delivered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=907.0)|
| 0:15:11| on the amount of land that it was delivered and in the score footages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=911.0)|
| 0:15:16| this was able to beat the price points of the townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=916.0)|
| 0:15:19| that this developer was selling in the same project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=919.0)|
| 0:15:22| by I think I want to say 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=922.0)|
| 0:15:26| So it was lower and reached a different market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=926.0)|
| 0:15:29| than the rest of the townhouses were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=929.0)|
| 0:15:31| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=931.0)|
| 0:15:32| And then the last example of a built project is a whole green field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=932.0)|
| 0:15:36| a whole brand new project out of scratch or from scratch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=936.0)|
| 0:15:40| in out of south of Lincoln, Nebraska.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=940.0)|
| 0:15:43| And this is 600 units, and it's about 60 percent built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=943.0)|
| 0:15:49| And you could see the different buildings here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=949.0)|
| 0:15:52| brand new streets and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=952.0)|
| 0:15:54| What's really interesting about this one is this is a former apartment developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=954.0)|
| 0:15:57| somebody who used to build apartments like everybody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=957.0)|
| 0:16:02| And one day he said, I want to build space that I can lease 100 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=962.0)|
| 0:16:09| and right now I'm building space that I can't lease everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=969.0)|
| 0:16:11| lobbies, recreation rooms, all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=971.0)|
| 0:16:13| I want to build completely leaseable space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=973.0)|
| 0:16:16| And he said, I've seen these missing middle types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=976.0)|
| 0:16:18| and because they're walk-ups, they don't have corridors in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=978.0)|
| 0:16:21| they don't have lobbies, I think I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=981.0)|
| 0:16:24| And so that's one of the things that attracted him to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=984.0)|
| 0:16:26| So this entire project is all those types that I showed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=986.0)|
| 0:16:30| the small and medium ones, the duplex on up, there are no houses in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=990.0)|
| 0:16:35| It's all missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=995.0)|
| 0:16:37| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=997.0)|
| 0:16:38| So why is it needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=998.0)|
| 0:16:40| Today, you know, just a quick three statistics here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1000.0)|
| 0:16:44| Thirty percent of American households are single-person households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1004.0)|
| 0:16:49| and for Knoxville the number is 40 percent, according to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1009.0)|
| 0:16:55| And another important thing is in, what, seven more years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1015.0)|
| 0:17:00| 20 percent of us will be 65, including me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1020.0)|
| 0:17:04| I'll be 65 in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1024.0)|
| 0:17:07| And then the other important thing is that the single-person household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1027.0)|
| 0:17:12| and just the smaller household demographic is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1032.0)|
| 0:17:17| Across the country it's 75 percent at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1037.0)|
| 0:17:20| In Knoxville, as of today, it's 78 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1040.0)|
| 0:17:23| So what we see is communities across the country are exploring other housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1043.0)|
| 0:17:28| choices to deal with this growing trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1048.0)|
| 0:17:32| So what can missing middle housing do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1052.0)|
| 0:17:34| I'll just read these off and we can talk about them when we get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1054.0)|
| 0:17:37| the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1057.0)|
| 0:17:39| But it certainly adds more attainable, meaning more price attainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1059.0)|
| 0:17:46| housing options to your housing stock that don't currently exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1066.0)|
| 0:17:50| increases rental options, and it makes more smaller units available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1070.0)|
| 0:17:57| than are currently available right now usually in cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1077.0)|
| 0:18:01| And it also helps homeowners add a way to make more income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1081.0)|
| 0:18:05| or income at all, on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1085.0)|
| 0:18:07| Besides them just paying a mortgage lets them add a unit or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1087.0)|
| 0:18:11| depending on the rules, to their property that they might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1091.0)|
| 0:18:14| otherwise be able to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1094.0)|
| 0:18:17| So why is it missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1097.0)|
| 0:18:19| What are barriers to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1099.0)|
| 0:18:21| Maybe what are some best practices to be aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1101.0)|
| 0:18:24| When we did the missing middle scan last fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1104.0)|
| 0:18:28| these are the main findings that we came away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1108.0)|
| 0:18:32| And just in the interest of time, I'll tell you that the biggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1112.0)|
| 0:18:37| most repeating finding that we came upon in reading the area plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1117.0)|
| 0:18:43| and reading the zoning is that the zoning doesn't have that many barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1123.0)|
| 0:18:47| There's some technical barriers here and there that can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1127.0)|
| 0:18:51| But the biggest one was the lack of clarity of where you mean big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1131.0)|
| 0:18:54| apartments and where you don't mean big apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1134.0)|
| 0:18:57| Multifamily is this big category across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1137.0)|
| 0:19:01| and what we found is cities need a little more nuance than they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1141.0)|
| 0:19:04| currently have to be able to say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1144.0)|
| 0:19:08| I know the comp plan and the zoning says multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1148.0)|
| 0:19:12| but we didn't mean that big multifamily over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1152.0)|
| 0:19:15| We meant it over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1155.0)|
| 0:19:17| Cities don't currently have a lot of tools to articulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1157.0)|
| 0:19:21| And so that's what a lot of times we help cities with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1161.0)|
| 0:19:25| is just to make them aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1165.0)|
| 0:19:27| but also help them with ways to make that clear and helpful to both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1167.0)|
| 0:19:33| investor and neighbors alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1173.0)|
| 0:19:36| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1176.0)|
| 0:19:38| So some barriers that we see across the country and best practices that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1178.0)|
| 0:19:43| we recommend to you, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1183.0)|
| 0:19:46| with the idea of clarity about what you mean by multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1186.0)|
| 0:19:50| On the left-hand side is missing middle, a six-plex mansion apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1190.0)|
| 0:19:54| On the right is a 24-unit, three-story apartment building that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1194.0)|
| 0:19:59| in many cities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1199.0)|
| 0:20:01| They're both multifamily, but which one do you mean where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1201.0)|
| 0:20:05| And that's super helpful for investor and neighbor alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1205.0)|
| 0:20:09| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1209.0)|
| 0:20:10| Density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1210.0)|
| 0:20:11| As I mentioned this morning, density is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1211.0)|
| 0:20:14| this might sound weird to tell you, but it's not the conversation to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1214.0)|
| 0:20:18| You know, in city after city, everybody's focused on density because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1218.0)|
| 0:20:23| that's what's in a lot of the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1223.0)|
| 0:20:26| It's what's in a lot of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1226.0)|
| 0:20:28| So that's why we end up talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1228.0)|
| 0:20:31| But if you look at the places that were built that you tend to like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1231.0)|
| 0:20:34| they weren't built by density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1234.0)|
| 0:20:36| They were built just by design, and the density is a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1236.0)|
| 0:20:39| So as an example, here's a picture on the left of a three-story building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1239.0)|
| 0:20:43| longer than you can see in the photograph, with 49 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1243.0)|
| 0:20:47| It measures 30 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1247.0)|
| 0:20:49| The building on the right is a missing middle mansion apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1249.0)|
| 0:20:53| with five units in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1253.0)|
| 0:20:55| It's a house scale, and it measures 29 to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1255.0)|
| 0:20:59| So let's just take the example of your 24 to the acre maximum limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1259.0)|
| 0:21:03| in your RN4 and RN3, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1263.0)|
| 0:21:09| If somebody said, okay, we like missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1269.0)|
| 0:21:11| but we're going to cap everything at 24 to the acre, let's agree to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1271.0)|
| 0:21:15| you would leave out the five plex on the side because it's 29 to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1275.0)|
| 0:21:19| So what we recommend to people, to cities, is to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1279.0)|
| 0:21:23| don't regulate by density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1283.0)|
| 0:21:25| Regulate by form and by other standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1285.0)|
| 0:21:28| And as long as somebody meets your standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1288.0)|
| 0:21:30| if somebody can fit four units in there or five and meet the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1290.0)|
| 0:21:34| what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1294.0)|
| 0:21:35| If they could put six in there and still meet the standards that you set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1295.0)|
| 0:21:38| what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1298.0)|
| 0:21:40| And to illustrate that, maybe Amelia might develop it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1300.0)|
| 0:21:46| you know, my objectives are to put four in there, and I'm fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1306.0)|
| 0:21:50| and I meet the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1310.0)|
| 0:21:52| Seema might say, I think I might put five in there because I want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1312.0)|
| 0:21:56| a couple smaller units and hit a different part of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1316.0)|
| 0:21:59| I'm still meeting the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1319.0)|
| 0:22:01| They have the flexibility to choose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1321.0)|
| 0:22:03| Right now a density or a lot area requirement, which is the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1323.0)|
| 0:22:06| doesn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1326.0)|
| 0:22:08| It puts a max on it, and that has a whole different effect on what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1328.0)|
| 0:22:12| on the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1332.0)|
| 0:22:13| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1333.0)|
| 0:22:14| Coordinating parking with existing lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1334.0)|
| 0:22:17| Often parking is simply ñ parking is a huge issue, don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1337.0)|
| 0:22:21| It is probably one of the toughest issues to solve because it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1341.0)|
| 0:22:25| local, it's very personal, and it can be very emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1345.0)|
| 0:22:29| So we just simply recommend that it be looked at on a sliding scale based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1349.0)|
| 0:22:36| on location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1356.0)|
| 0:22:38| The closer that you are to services, shopping, food, where some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1358.0)|
| 0:22:43| not everybody, some people might not drive for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1363.0)|
| 0:22:47| If a case can be made like that, then there might be a case that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1367.0)|
| 0:22:51| could lower the parking requirements in places like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1371.0)|
| 0:22:54| The farther you get away from all those things, certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1374.0)|
| 0:22:57| you have to have more parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1377.0)|
| 0:22:59| And that's all we're saying is that this picture on the left is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1379.0)|
| 0:23:04| hey, we're going to require the same amount of parking everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1384.0)|
| 0:23:07| regardless of where we are in the city, it doesn't matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1387.0)|
| 0:23:09| And so I use the phrase, they ate their neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1389.0)|
| 0:23:13| to satisfy the parking code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1393.0)|
| 0:23:15| On the right, it's the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1395.0)|
| 0:23:17| Hey, we're near transit or we're near shopping, we're near services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1397.0)|
| 0:23:20| Whatever fits on that lot is what's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1400.0)|
| 0:23:23| and that is in relation to the number of units on the lot, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1403.0)|
| 0:23:27| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1407.0)|
| 0:23:29| Lot width instead of lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1409.0)|
| 0:23:31| This is another one where most zoning codes regulate lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1411.0)|
| 0:23:35| And, again, that goes back to how zoning started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1415.0)|
| 0:23:38| Big pieces of property and wanting to keep buildings away from each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1418.0)|
| 0:23:43| other for a bunch of good reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1423.0)|
| 0:23:45| But when you talk about platted lots that already exist on existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1425.0)|
| 0:23:48| blocks in the city, you really want to look at lot width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1428.0)|
| 0:23:52| because that determines what can fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1432.0)|
| 0:23:54| Lot area, somebody might comply with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1434.0)|
| 0:23:56| but it's usually freezing out development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1436.0)|
| 0:24:00| because somebody might say, well, I can fit X on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1440.0)|
| 0:24:04| Yeah, but you don't meet the lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1444.0)|
| 0:24:06| Well, then I can't do anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1446.0)|
| 0:24:08| But if you just regulate it by lot width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1448.0)|
| 0:24:10| that has a lot more bearing on what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1450.0)|
| 0:24:14| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1454.0)|
| 0:24:16| Last few here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1456.0)|
| 0:24:18| This seems like an arcane topic to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1458.0)|
| 0:24:21| especially to a city council, but you need to know that things as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1461.0)|
| 0:24:26| mundane as driveway widths can stop a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1466.0)|
| 0:24:29| And it's not that the people with these standards mean to stop projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1469.0)|
| 0:24:34| They have a certain mission, and their standards are in their documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1474.0)|
| 0:24:39| and they have to carry out their standards, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1479.0)|
| 0:24:42| And so a lot of times it goes unnoticed that a multifamily project has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1482.0)|
| 0:24:47| requirement, let's say in this case, for a 20-foot driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1487.0)|
| 0:24:50| Well, if you apply that 20-foot driveway to the situation on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1490.0)|
| 0:24:54| for those house-scale buildings, it's way too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1494.0)|
| 0:24:56| It's probably half the lot, you know, or most of a 50-foot wide lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1496.0)|
| 0:25:01| So you really want to scale requirements for missing middle projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1501.0)|
| 0:25:06| as distinct from regular multifamily projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1506.0)|
| 0:25:11| And then just being clear, if you mean to say we are looking for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1511.0)|
| 0:25:17| three- or four-story development in this area of our city, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1517.0)|
| 0:25:21| do you mean regular apartment projects, which have their place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1521.0)|
| 0:25:24| or do you mean the large portion of missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1524.0)|
| 0:25:27| like on the right-hand side of the screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1527.0)|
| 0:25:29| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1529.0)|
| 0:25:31| So what are the opportunities here in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1531.0)|
| 0:25:33| What can you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1533.0)|
| 0:25:34| What would we recommend to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1534.0)|
| 0:25:35| We have four recommendations as priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1535.0)|
| 0:25:38| First one is establish a core group of stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1538.0)|
| 0:25:42| and project champions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1542.0)|
| 0:25:44| Developers, realtors, neighbors, community groups, nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1544.0)|
| 0:25:48| Get a wide variety of people together that are interested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1548.0)|
| 0:25:54| and can make this go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1554.0)|
| 0:25:57| And also select a geographic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1557.0)|
| 0:26:01| So start small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1561.0)|
| 0:26:04| You have enough of a city that you have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1564.0)|
| 0:26:07| Start small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1567.0)|
| 0:26:09| See where you can get some good results on this, some traction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1569.0)|
| 0:26:13| with that core group, and then go out if you're going to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1573.0)|
| 0:26:17| With that kind of basis, then you will have already looked at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1577.0)|
| 0:26:22| kind of changes you need to make to the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1582.0)|
| 0:26:25| Make those changes, and maybe those are incremental as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1585.0)|
| 0:26:29| And then lastly, publicize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1589.0)|
| 0:26:32| What you're doing, why and where, and what it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1592.0)|
| 0:26:35| What it is and what it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1595.0)|
| 0:26:37| Often, you know, the public hears multifamily and they say, wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1597.0)|
| 0:26:41| wait a second, you know, we told you we didn't want multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1601.0)|
| 0:26:45| buildings in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1605.0)|
| 0:26:47| No, we need to talk about what this is and what it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1607.0)|
| 0:26:50| And then lastly, just simply go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1610.0)|
| 0:26:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1615.0)|
| 0:26:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1616.0)|
| 0:26:57| Just effectively advocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1617.0)|
| 0:26:58| I can't emphasize that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1618.0)|
| 0:27:02| Because I was in city government in my first 13 years of my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1622.0)|
| 0:27:06| and I always used to really observe that if you don't fill in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1626.0)|
| 0:27:11| blank, it will be filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1631.0)|
| 0:27:13| So you have to really communicate about what it is you're doing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1633.0)|
| 0:27:16| what it is you're not doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1636.0)|
| 0:27:18| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1638.0)|
| 0:27:19| Last couple slides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1639.0)|
| 0:27:20| One of the groups that can really help you is AARP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1640.0)|
| 0:27:23| We work with AARP all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1643.0)|
| 0:27:25| We're one of several consultants that they call upon to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1645.0)|
| 0:27:29| kind of work about advocacy for different housing choices and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1649.0)|
| 0:27:32| especially missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1652.0)|
| 0:27:34| So you can enlist them tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1654.0)|
| 0:27:36| They'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1656.0)|
| 0:27:38| And then start, we recommend that you start in places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1658.0)|
| 0:27:42| like I mentioned, nodes, that there was one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1662.0)|
| 0:27:46| the restaurant went into, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1666.0)|
| 0:27:50| Happy Hauler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1670.0)|
| 0:27:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1672.0)|
| 0:27:53| So the area along that avenue, it looks like there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1673.0)|
| 0:27:57| investment happening there, restaurants and places to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1677.0)|
| 0:28:03| That is a perfect place as a node that has amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1683.0)|
| 0:28:07| If you look at the things that we're talking about, walking to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1687.0)|
| 0:28:11| they're not just shops and services and food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1691.0)|
| 0:28:13| They're amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1693.0)|
| 0:28:15| Think about, like, when developers do a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1695.0)|
| 0:28:17| they always want an amenity, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1697.0)|
| 0:28:19| Well, you have amenities you already have in your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1699.0)|
| 0:28:22| You don't need to gravitate around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1702.0)|
| 0:28:26| And those are places to start with missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1706.0)|
| 0:28:30| So last couple slides here about testing what you're thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1710.0)|
| 0:28:34| Once you start working with a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1714.0)|
| 0:28:36| you start looking at the kinds of places where you might consider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1716.0)|
| 0:28:39| and you want to test this, do some drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1719.0)|
| 0:28:42| do some testing on actual parcels, talk it out, go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1722.0)|
| 0:28:48| and lay it out and talk to people and communicate and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1728.0)|
| 0:28:52| this is what we're talking about, this is not what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1732.0)|
| 0:28:55| how's this working, does it work financially, what kind of changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1735.0)|
| 0:28:59| if any, do we need to make to zoning, all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1739.0)|
| 0:29:02| They just pop up and you can address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1742.0)|
| 0:29:05| And then the last slide here, you can put them all down on paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1745.0)|
| 0:29:09| share them, publicize them, educate and be educated by input from all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1749.0)|
| 0:29:15| kinds of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1755.0)|
| 0:29:17| And then you can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1757.0)|
| 0:29:19| Last slide here, you can go forward with a pilot project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1759.0)|
| 0:29:23| There's lots of ways to go, but maybe you'll make changes in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1763.0)|
| 0:29:28| policies and your zoning and leave it to the investment community to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1768.0)|
| 0:29:32| it, or you might partner with a community land trust or nonprofit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1772.0)|
| 0:29:37| do a test pilot project to plant the seeds and to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1777.0)|
| 0:29:42| this is what we're trying to do, we want you to join.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1782.0)|
| 0:29:45| So that's the last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1785.0)|
| 0:29:47| I really thank you for your attention and I'm ready for your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1787.0)|
| 0:29:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1790.0)|
| 0:29:51| Thank you, Mr. Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1791.0)|
| 0:29:52| I did have a light on for Councilmember Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1792.0)|
| 0:29:54| so I'll call on her for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1794.0)|
| 0:29:56| Yeah, I just, when you kept saying change the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1796.0)|
| 0:30:00| change the standards, I think you listed some of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1800.0)|
| 0:30:03| but for the benefit of us and anyone listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1803.0)|
| 0:30:07| what exactly do you mean when you say modify your standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1807.0)|
| 0:30:12| Yeah, so in the scan, we found a couple of things that presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1812.0)|
| 0:30:19| barriers to missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1819.0)|
| 0:30:22| Not as a complete stopper of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1822.0)|
| 0:30:25| but it would pose an obstacle in one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1825.0)|
| 0:30:29| Things like minimum lot area or density, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1829.0)|
| 0:30:37| The parking, especially on smaller parcels, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1837.0)|
| 0:30:42| I know parking is a super special issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1842.0)|
| 0:30:46| And then there were a couple other minor standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1846.0)|
| 0:30:49| but the two bigger ones were lot area density and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1849.0)|
| 0:30:54| And I think lot coverage in maybe one zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1854.0)|
| 0:31:00| But what I meant generally, the reason I didn't refer to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1860.0)|
| 0:31:03| specifically is that depending on where you choose to try this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1863.0)|
| 0:31:08| it may present issues that we didn't see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1868.0)|
| 0:31:10| and so that's why I said it generically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1870.0)|
| 0:31:12| just changing the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1872.0)|
| 0:31:14| So not saying change all standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1874.0)|
| 0:31:16| but changing the ones that are preventing the outcomes that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1876.0)|
| 0:31:19| want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1879.0)|
| 0:31:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1881.0)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1882.0)|
| 0:31:23| Yeah, you're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1883.0)|
| 0:31:25| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1885.0)|
| 0:31:29| One thing that struck me about the presentation was the focus on density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1889.0)|
| 0:31:35| and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1895.0)|
| 0:31:37| And some of the concerns I've heard from residents and from other planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1897.0)|
| 0:31:43| processes in other cities is when there's a disconnect between budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1903.0)|
| 0:31:51| road improvements and plans to increase density in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1911.0)|
| 0:31:57| So to change the standards and not consider density during the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1917.0)|
| 0:32:06| process was a surprise to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1926.0)|
| 0:32:08| Can you talk more about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1928.0)|
| 0:32:09| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1929.0)|
| 0:32:10| So I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1930.0)|
| 0:32:12| I'm not saying don't consider density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1932.0)|
| 0:32:14| I'm asking you to consider not regulating by density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1934.0)|
| 0:32:18| So when you would go through a planning process and look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1938.0)|
| 0:32:21| projections for infrastructure of all kinds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1941.0)|
| 0:32:24| you certainly would consider the projected populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1944.0)|
| 0:32:28| the projected needs, and if that translated into a density number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1948.0)|
| 0:32:32| I'm just simply saying once you've done that and you know the outcomes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1952.0)|
| 0:32:36| you want, there's a way to get those outcomes without putting a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1956.0)|
| 0:32:39| regulation in your standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1959.0)|
| 0:32:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1961.0)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1962.0)|
| 0:32:48| I would just ask, Mr. Perez, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1968.0)|
| 0:32:50| one of the things I found interesting in the presentation was about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1970.0)|
| 0:32:54| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1974.0)|
| 0:32:55| I guess how the scale and the fit in the neighborhood that you were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1975.0)|
| 0:32:59| to, you know, accommodate, you know, this missing middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1979.0)|
| 0:33:05| but it also fits the same character as the homes around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1985.0)|
| 0:33:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1989.0)|
| 0:33:10| So I found that quite interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1990.0)|
| 0:33:12| The one question I did have, though, with regard to the missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1992.0)|
| 0:33:17| you know, we definitely deal a lot with rental spaces right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1997.0)|
| 0:33:22| and we need to have more space for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2002.0)|
| 0:33:26| people who are moving in here and also more affordable space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2006.0)|
| 0:33:29| And I would imagine that this can be more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2009.0)|
| 0:33:33| But I also wanted to ask, is this also the missing middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2013.0)|
| 0:33:37| Is it something that you can own as well as something that is a rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2017.0)|
| 0:33:43| And the reason for that is just thinking about equity and the ability for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2023.0)|
| 0:33:47| you know, folks who are owning, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2027.0)|
| 0:33:49| a unit to be able to build up some equity over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2029.0)|
| 0:33:53| Can you explore that with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2033.0)|
| 0:33:56| Yeah, certainly, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2036.0)|
| 0:33:58| The missing middle can be rental or ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2038.0)|
| 0:34:03| The projects that I showed you, the majority of them are rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2043.0)|
| 0:34:08| Some are exploring ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2048.0)|
| 0:34:11| And I say exploring because ownership is tougher if it's not a townhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2051.0)|
| 0:34:15| just because of the condominium requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2055.0)|
| 0:34:18| and all the legal requirements around condominium ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2058.0)|
| 0:34:22| And so that's another one of those obstacles that people don't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2062.0)|
| 0:34:27| Maybe this board does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2067.0)|
| 0:34:29| but the general public doesn't necessarily realize that the ability for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2069.0)|
| 0:34:35| condominium project to happen on a sixplex is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2075.0)|
| 0:34:39| or the process is basically the same as for a giant 400-unit building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2079.0)|
| 0:34:45| And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2085.0)|
| 0:34:47| just like multifamily is this big term that needs to be parsed out into four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2087.0)|
| 0:34:51| and five-story versions of multifamily and house scale versions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2091.0)|
| 0:34:55| the same goes for the condo ownership requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2095.0)|
| 0:35:01| that they aren't parsed out the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2101.0)|
| 0:35:04| So it's a huge hurdle for a small builder to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2104.0)|
| 0:35:07| And so you tend to see more rentals than ownership, but it is for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2107.0)|
| 0:35:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2112.0)|
| 0:35:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2113.0)|
| 0:35:14| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2114.0)|
| 0:35:15| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2115.0)|
| 0:35:16| Thank you, Mr. Perez, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2116.0)|
| 0:35:18| You mentioned the importance of not restricting use in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2118.0)|
| 0:35:24| and I think the South Waterfront Code is a good example of form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2124.0)|
| 0:35:28| that allows for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2128.0)|
| 0:35:30| I think it's meant for missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2130.0)|
| 0:35:32| and I think that's a good example, I think, in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2132.0)|
| 0:35:36| One of the things that I didn't see in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2136.0)|
| 0:35:39| or here today was the importance of pedestrian infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2139.0)|
| 0:35:44| particularly sidewalks, and also retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2144.0)|
| 0:35:48| I think just a quick scan of the report, although it was very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2148.0)|
| 0:35:53| by the way, don't hear me criticizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2153.0)|
| 0:35:55| but there's 100 references to walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2155.0)|
| 0:35:57| and there's less than five references to sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2157.0)|
| 0:36:00| So I also didn't see any kind of retail in the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2160.0)|
| 0:36:04| which doesn't mean that's limited to today's presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2164.0)|
| 0:36:07| But one of the things that's unique to the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2167.0)|
| 0:36:10| and the form-based code is that I think it references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2170.0)|
| 0:36:13| park-once walkable centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2173.0)|
| 0:36:16| Can you talk a little bit about the importance of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2176.0)|
| 0:36:19| and, you know, public transportation important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2179.0)|
| 0:36:22| I mentioned sidewalks, but the idea that you can take care of a lot of life's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2182.0)|
| 0:36:27| actions or at least a good bit of them without having to drive around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2187.0)|
| 0:36:32| If all we do is focus on the housing element of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2192.0)|
| 0:36:35| then we just create congestion with housed congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2195.0)|
| 0:36:40| And so talk a little bit about the retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2200.0)|
| 0:36:42| and pedestrian infrastructure role in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2202.0)|
| 0:36:46| Yeah, thank you for the question, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2206.0)|
| 0:36:49| Yeah, so I focused on the housing portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2209.0)|
| 0:36:53| and just made reference to the amenities and the walkability that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2213.0)|
| 0:36:59| But certainly we are assuming that in talking that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2219.0)|
| 0:37:05| we are assuming that there's something to walk to other than more houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2225.0)|
| 0:37:10| And that's why we use the term amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2230.0)|
| 0:37:13| that there's shopping, food, services, and transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2233.0)|
| 0:37:16| one or all four of those in any combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2236.0)|
| 0:37:20| And that's where you want to gravitate around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2240.0)|
| 0:37:26| and focus initial efforts for missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2246.0)|
| 0:37:29| because of all the reasons you just stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2249.0)|
| 0:37:32| And that those areas, I made the assumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2252.0)|
| 0:37:39| I should be more explicit, that they are walkable because of the proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2259.0)|
| 0:37:45| of the units to all those services and amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2265.0)|
| 0:37:48| but they're walkable also because it's fun to walk there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2268.0)|
| 0:37:52| and it's pleasant, it's good to walk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2272.0)|
| 0:37:55| There are good sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2275.0)|
| 0:37:56| There's a lot of what you call pedestrian infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2276.0)|
| 0:37:59| or even bike infrastructure for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2279.0)|
| 0:38:01| So, yeah, I apologize for not bringing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2281.0)|
| 0:38:04| But, yeah, it's a component of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2284.0)|
| 0:38:06| And just to, I guess, underscore that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2286.0)|
| 0:38:10| the project I showed in Nebraska is from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2290.0)|
| 0:38:14| There's nothing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2294.0)|
| 0:38:15| And the developer said, you know, I want to do this the right way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2295.0)|
| 0:38:18| so I'm going to build the amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2298.0)|
| 0:38:20| I'm going to build a main street that doesn't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2300.0)|
| 0:38:22| so that I have that pedestrian amenity for people to walk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2302.0)|
| 0:38:28| And it's interesting because his project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2308.0)|
| 0:38:30| if you think of it as a rectangle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2310.0)|
| 0:38:32| he put it over on the left-hand side, northwest part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2312.0)|
| 0:38:36| because if you zoom out with all the other big projects that are happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2316.0)|
| 0:38:40| when it's all built, that's where the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2320.0)|
| 0:38:43| that everybody's going to go to will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2323.0)|
| 0:38:45| And so, yeah, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2325.0)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2327.0)|
| 0:38:48| To your credit, you mentioned Happy Holler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2328.0)|
| 0:38:50| and I think that's a good example, I think, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2330.0)|
| 0:38:52| But I think those main street villages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2332.0)|
| 0:38:54| I think part of the reason that missing middle works so well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2334.0)|
| 0:39:00| is because people are there every other day or every four days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2340.0)|
| 0:39:03| to transact for some reason as opposed to we restrict parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2343.0)|
| 0:39:07| but encourage density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2347.0)|
| 0:39:10| You've got people just congested or not moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2350.0)|
| 0:39:12| So I think it's important for us, collectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2352.0)|
| 0:39:15| to remember that importance of the village retail plays a huge role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2355.0)|
| 0:39:21| in how this is even possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2361.0)|
| 0:39:23| Yeah, and just to keep going with your point, Councilmember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2363.0)|
| 0:39:28| there are in every community there are nodes, you know, these centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2368.0)|
| 0:39:33| Like Happy Holler is one that you can tell it's really taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2373.0)|
| 0:39:36| But there are others in communities where you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2376.0)|
| 0:39:39| well, that one looks like it had some help or some investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2379.0)|
| 0:39:42| That could be a revived center that doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2382.0)|
| 0:39:45| It might even just be a crossroads, like two corners, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2385.0)|
| 0:39:48| but it could serve that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2388.0)|
| 0:39:50| And so it isn't always, and I'm not suggesting you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2390.0)|
| 0:39:54| but just for clarity, it isn't always about the popular ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2394.0)|
| 0:39:58| that are already out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2398.0)|
| 0:40:00| It's about ones that used to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2400.0)|
| 0:40:02| I saw one in Lonsdale that looked like it could be revived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2402.0)|
| 0:40:05| with some investment, and it could be a nice, you know, two corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2405.0)|
| 0:40:09| And then you could gravitate around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2409.0)|
| 0:40:12| So, yeah, to your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2412.0)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2413.0)|
| 0:40:14| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2414.0)|
| 0:40:15| Councilmember Feagin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2415.0)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2416.0)|
| 0:40:18| One thing that you said that really struck a chord with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2418.0)|
| 0:40:21| is defining multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2421.0)|
| 0:40:24| because we have multifamily housing all around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2424.0)|
| 0:40:31| in a lot of places that people just don't think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2431.0)|
| 0:40:34| I mean, there's the little strip road that's got condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2434.0)|
| 0:40:37| that touch side by side that are at a different price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2437.0)|
| 0:40:40| You look out at North Shore Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2440.0)|
| 0:40:42| they have big houses, apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2442.0)|
| 0:40:45| They have all sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2445.0)|
| 0:40:47| So I do think getting people to acknowledge that a townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2447.0)|
| 0:40:51| or the big old Victorian, you see them in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2451.0)|
| 0:40:56| where they are apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2456.0)|
| 0:40:58| But your point about the financing is a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2458.0)|
| 0:41:03| The wealth can still be built if someone owns it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2463.0)|
| 0:41:06| and then they buy the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2466.0)|
| 0:41:09| and then rent to help pay their mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2469.0)|
| 0:41:11| You see, watch a lot of those home improvement shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2471.0)|
| 0:41:14| and they do that a lot in the big cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2474.0)|
| 0:41:16| So it would be nice to have that opportunity here for citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2476.0)|
| 0:41:21| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2481.0)|
| 0:41:22| You talked about starting around Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2482.0)|
| 0:41:25| It sounds to me like this could also be a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2485.0)|
| 0:41:29| for infill housing in some of our small city lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2489.0)|
| 0:41:34| that that might be a nice way to build homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2494.0)|
| 0:41:38| that matched the architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2498.0)|
| 0:41:41| and that could be a good way to show communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2501.0)|
| 0:41:44| that this can work and look just like your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2504.0)|
| 0:41:49| Is that also a possibility of a way to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2509.0)|
| 0:41:52| Yeah, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2512.0)|
| 0:41:54| I just want to, to be fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2514.0)|
| 0:41:59| I use Happy Holler as one of several potential examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2519.0)|
| 0:42:03| Oh, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2523.0)|
| 0:42:04| I'm not criticizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2524.0)|
| 0:42:05| No, I didn't mean you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2525.0)|
| 0:42:07| I just wanted to say that the way I said it earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2527.0)|
| 0:42:10| might sound like, hey, that guy from California said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2530.0)|
| 0:42:13| we should go to Happy Holler and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2533.0)|
| 0:42:16| I'm just suggesting that that is a really good example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2536.0)|
| 0:42:19| of an emerging viable center with amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2539.0)|
| 0:42:24| around which you could start Missing Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2544.0)|
| 0:42:27| and there are several others in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2547.0)|
| 0:42:30| that could qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2550.0)|
| 0:42:32| And I would just say we can do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2552.0)|
| 0:42:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2554.0)|
| 0:42:35| I mean, there's nothing that says you can be real strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2555.0)|
| 0:42:38| around Happy Holler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2558.0)|
| 0:42:39| but if there's some quick wins on some infill lots that look awful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2559.0)|
| 0:42:44| that might be a good way to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2564.0)|
| 0:42:47| Just along that point real quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2567.0)|
| 0:42:49| I think one of the things, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2569.0)|
| 0:42:52| that house scale portion of that, that one liner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2572.0)|
| 0:42:55| house scale with multiple units and walkable neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2575.0)|
| 0:42:58| house scale is critical because, as I've told other people today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2578.0)|
| 0:43:04| that we've spoken with, you know, they ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2584.0)|
| 0:43:07| well, how has this failed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2587.0)|
| 0:43:09| Where has it, you know, not worked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2589.0)|
| 0:43:11| Where it hasn't worked is when communities don't stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2591.0)|
| 0:43:16| to that house scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2596.0)|
| 0:43:17| They'll say, oh, those guys are crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2597.0)|
| 0:43:20| Let's go for four stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2600.0)|
| 0:43:21| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2601.0)|
| 0:43:23| Or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2603.0)|
| 0:43:24| We've had places in Australia say, yeah, we tried this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2604.0)|
| 0:43:29| and we went for six, six stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2609.0)|
| 0:43:32| and they're calling it Missing Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2612.0)|
| 0:43:35| and they're trying to put it in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2615.0)|
| 0:43:37| I mean, who wants that in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2617.0)|
| 0:43:39| And so the test has to be, A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2619.0)|
| 0:43:41| can it fit on a lot that's already in a neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2621.0)|
| 0:43:44| And, B, what you put on that lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2624.0)|
| 0:43:47| does it fit with the houses in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2627.0)|
| 0:43:50| If it doesn't pass those two tests, it's not house scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2630.0)|
| 0:43:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2633.0)|
| 0:43:54| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2634.0)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2635.0)|
| 0:43:56| There was a guy in here from California that said we should start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2636.0)|
| 0:43:59| in Happy Holler, but one of the things he didn't talk about was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2639.0)|
| 0:44:04| did you all look at our lighted property redevelopment processes at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2644.0)|
| 0:44:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2651.0)|
| 0:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2652.0)|
| 0:44:13| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2653.0)|
| 0:44:14| More to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2654.0)|
| 0:44:15| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2655.0)|
| 0:44:16| More to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2656.0)|
| 0:44:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2657.0)|
| 0:44:18| That's the next chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2658.0)|
| 0:44:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2660.0)|
| 0:44:21| I think those are the questions we have at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2661.0)|
| 0:44:23| We can obviously call you back, Mr. Perez, but thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2663.0)|
| 0:44:26| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2666.0)|
| 0:44:27| I want to welcome Deputy to the Mayor, Gil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2667.0)|
| 0:44:30| who I think is going to lead us through some opportunities to support Missing Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2670.0)|
| 0:44:35| Exactly, and I love the discussion so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2675.0)|
| 0:44:37| because I think hopefully you'll see some of those ideas reflected also in the analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2677.0)|
| 0:44:41| that our staff has already thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2681.0)|
| 0:44:43| So before we get started, in addition to thanking Tony and his team for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2683.0)|
| 0:44:47| I also want to thank Council for inviting this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2687.0)|
| 0:44:50| because it gave us an opportunity to deepen our relationship with Opticoast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2690.0)|
| 0:44:54| and we really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2694.0)|
| 0:44:56| In making this workshop possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2696.0)|
| 0:44:58| I want to acknowledge that not only is the city supporting the travel for these two folks from Opticoast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2698.0)|
| 0:45:04| but also we have support for that travel and their time here from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2704.0)|
| 0:45:09| and also Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2709.0)|
| 0:45:11| So appreciating the fact that this is an interest that's not just limited to City Council or for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2711.0)|
| 0:45:16| but something that we see an appetite for and a conversation starting elsewhere in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2716.0)|
| 0:45:22| I also want to give a shout-out to our tech guru,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2722.0)|
| 0:45:25| but really the content guru on setting this up is Cheryl Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2725.0)|
| 0:45:29| You all know Cheryl, and she's really taken this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2729.0)|
| 0:45:32| to make sure that this is a high-quality discussion for you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2732.0)|
| 0:45:35| and has had some help from our Baker Center fellow, Om, who is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2735.0)|
| 0:45:40| Wave, Om. Oh, did she just leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2740.0)|
| 0:45:42| Well, anyway, we've had some help from some of our Baker Center fellows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2742.0)|
| 0:45:46| I am going to lead the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2746.0)|
| 0:45:47| but I want to acknowledge that there are some folks here from other city teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2747.0)|
| 0:45:50| and that this reflects a very collaborative discussion that we've had across departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2750.0)|
| 0:45:54| So in particular, as your questions deepen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2754.0)|
| 0:45:57| we might tap some of the staff who are here from Plans Review and Inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2757.0)|
| 0:46:01| from Housing and Neighborhood Development, from Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2761.0)|
| 0:46:04| and especially of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2764.0)|
| 0:46:08| They were really helpful in helping us think through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2768.0)|
| 0:46:11| With that said, Tony really has laid a nice groundwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2771.0)|
| 0:46:15| and I hope gives you a lot to think about as we go through this next section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2775.0)|
| 0:46:19| I want to emphasize that we do have a housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2779.0)|
| 0:46:22| and we are excited to join Council in really saying, let's tackle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2782.0)|
| 0:46:27| It's a great thing because it reflects the high quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2787.0)|
| 0:46:30| that our residents experience and that is drawing people to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2790.0)|
| 0:46:34| So this is a reflection of, again, as the Mayor has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2794.0)|
| 0:46:36| it's a good problem to have, but it is a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2796.0)|
| 0:46:38| and we need to be very conscientious about thinking about strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2798.0)|
| 0:46:42| to support more and different types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2802.0)|
| 0:46:46| Just to give you a little bit of a statistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2806.0)|
| 0:46:48| and it may be one that you have perceived even if you haven't read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2808.0)|
| 0:46:52| but from 1990 to 2005, so over a 15-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2812.0)|
| 0:46:56| Knoxville grew by 1,800 residents total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2816.0)|
| 0:47:01| Since 2015, Knoxville has added 8,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2821.0)|
| 0:47:05| and projections are in the next few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2825.0)|
| 0:47:07| that we'll be adding 1,800 residents per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2827.0)|
| 0:47:12| So you think about our growth curve as accelerating rapidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2832.0)|
| 0:47:16| and if we don't prepare for that growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2836.0)|
| 0:47:18| and if we are not innovative and forward-thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2838.0)|
| 0:47:21| and finding ways to build housing for the people who are coming to join us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2841.0)|
| 0:47:25| in this wonderful city that we live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2845.0)|
| 0:47:27| then we will risk a deepening affordability problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2847.0)|
| 0:47:30| and price pressures and constraints for the people who live here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2850.0)|
| 0:47:34| So all that said, I'm going to come back to my seat, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2854.0)|
| 0:47:38| just to go through this, but Cheryl, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2858.0)|
| 0:47:43| You've seen a little bit of this already from Tony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2863.0)|
| 0:47:46| but the OptiCoast study focused on four residential property zones in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2866.0)|
| 0:47:52| and the good news is that we did see opportunity for missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2872.0)|
| 0:47:56| in all of those zones in some form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2876.0)|
| 0:48:00| That said, we also know that there is opportunity to do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2880.0)|
| 0:48:05| and that there were some barriers to missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2885.0)|
| 0:48:08| So we see this as an example for the townhouse on the right photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2888.0)|
| 0:48:13| We also see this in areas like Mechanicsville more recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2893.0)|
| 0:48:18| So we see an opportunity to build on what has been successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2898.0)|
| 0:48:22| and what folks might be familiar with in various places around their neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2902.0)|
| 0:48:26| to provide a diversity of price options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2906.0)|
| 0:48:29| and hopefully greater opportunity for economic mobility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2909.0)|
| 0:48:32| more housing for more types of families in more places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2912.0)|
| 0:48:39| The OptiCoast team really emphasized and appreciated the discussion around walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2919.0)|
| 0:48:45| because the best opportunities we have are where we have neighborhood-serving businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2925.0)|
| 0:48:49| within walking distance of housing, access to transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2929.0)|
| 0:48:52| and where there's already some density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2932.0)|
| 0:48:54| So we want to emphasize that these are not the only places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2934.0)|
| 0:48:57| that we can see missing middle housing be effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2937.0)|
| 0:48:59| but OptiCoast has identified some optimal opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2939.0)|
| 0:49:02| and that's where we want to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2942.0)|
| 0:49:05| I'll go through here quickly, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2945.0)|
| 0:49:07| emphasizing that we think that missing middle is ripe for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2947.0)|
| 0:49:12| because of some of these demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2952.0)|
| 0:49:14| and the opportunity not only to serve these emerging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2954.0)|
| 0:49:19| aging households, houses without children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2959.0)|
| 0:49:22| but also again do so in a way that really respects the form of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2962.0)|
| 0:49:26| and architecture that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2966.0)|
| 0:49:29| So we started this conversation with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2969.0)|
| 0:49:32| and we'd like to start it with you very much in a how might we type of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2972.0)|
| 0:49:36| So very much around where are the brainstorm points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2976.0)|
| 0:49:39| where we see pathways, where we see potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2979.0)|
| 0:49:43| but again we want to open this conversation with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2983.0)|
| 0:49:45| So what we're not doing today is bringing you any specific proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2985.0)|
| 0:49:48| We're really here to bring you some of the ideas that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2988.0)|
| 0:49:51| and start a conversation about how we might move those ideas forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2991.0)|
| 0:49:55| and hear your reaction to them, maybe get your ideas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2995.0)|
| 0:49:59| We've identified a few possible pathways and we'll go through them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2999.0)|
| 0:50:02| but we see some natural opportunities to embed missing middle housing principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3002.0)|
| 0:50:07| into some of our existing processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3007.0)|
| 0:50:09| and some of those have already been alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3009.0)|
| 0:50:11| We also see an opportunity to make some very targeted zoning tweaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3011.0)|
| 0:50:17| in specific geographic areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3017.0)|
| 0:50:19| Again, to Tony's point, we don't think it's viable to start citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3019.0)|
| 0:50:23| and we don't think that that's pragmatic based on the best practice from other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3023.0)|
| 0:50:27| So how do we think about making very specific tweaks in targeted zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3027.0)|
| 0:50:31| where we think missing middle housing can be most appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3031.0)|
| 0:50:34| We also want to look at how we can use tools in our incentive toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3034.0)|
| 0:50:38| to strategically encourage, and to your point, Councilwoman Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3038.0)|
| 0:50:42| maybe actually create some of these spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3042.0)|
| 0:50:44| through some targeted investments in targeted locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3044.0)|
| 0:50:50| So let's start with some of the things that we already have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3050.0)|
| 0:50:53| that we think we can build missing middle housing into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3053.0)|
| 0:50:58| The first is our one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3058.0)|
| 0:51:01| where we see an opportunity to set the stage at the high level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3061.0)|
| 0:51:04| for these types of housing opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3064.0)|
| 0:51:07| to provide that clarity around what is house-scale missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3067.0)|
| 0:51:12| versus some of the larger multifamily conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3072.0)|
| 0:51:18| So setting the stage at the high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3078.0)|
| 0:51:21| We also know that location criteria can be a barrier to a place for missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3081.0)|
| 0:51:26| Housing really makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3086.0)|
| 0:51:27| So we're also very interested in looking at how the land use classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3087.0)|
| 0:51:33| could be updated to reflect these principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3093.0)|
| 0:51:37| And again, we want to make sure that these changes align with our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3097.0)|
| 0:51:41| Many of you went through recode and we want to build on that effort, not redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3101.0)|
| 0:51:47| This has been alluded to, so thank you, Councilwoman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3107.0)|
| 0:51:50| But we also think that there's an opportunity to look at the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3110.0)|
| 0:51:53| and the principles that guide the operations of our blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3113.0)|
| 0:51:56| and homemakers programs and think about ways that we can be more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3116.0)|
| 0:52:00| in acknowledging the opportunity for missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3120.0)|
| 0:52:03| as a result of those programs that we already have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3123.0)|
| 0:52:09| So let's think about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3129.0)|
| 0:52:11| And again, really trying to emphasize the importance of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3131.0)|
| 0:52:15| and to emphasize here that as we consider this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3135.0)|
| 0:52:18| we're really thinking about where does it make the most sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3138.0)|
| 0:52:21| and what are the changes that can get us the benefit we're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3141.0)|
| 0:52:24| while not being so broad that we have the long protracted conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3144.0)|
| 0:52:30| that many of us were part of when we did recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3150.0)|
| 0:52:35| As I mentioned earlier and as you've heard a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3155.0)|
| 0:52:38| we do have opportunities for missing middle throughout our code already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3158.0)|
| 0:52:43| So we want to acknowledge that we have some residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3163.0)|
| 0:52:46| that currently allow some types of missing middle housing, and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3166.0)|
| 0:52:50| We also, as we looked into this, really recognized the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3170.0)|
| 0:52:54| that exists perhaps within the infill housing overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3174.0)|
| 0:52:57| This is an area, to mention Happy Holler, that really aligns well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3177.0)|
| 0:53:00| with some of those walkable close to transit and existing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3180.0)|
| 0:53:06| So we thought that that was another really good tool that we could build from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3186.0)|
| 0:53:10| And then we also, as you alluded to, Councilman Smith, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3190.0)|
| 0:53:13| the South Waterfront Code is a form-based code that allows missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3193.0)|
| 0:53:17| and we've seen some great examples of how that can shape in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3197.0)|
| 0:53:21| that really does add some architectural interest to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3201.0)|
| 0:53:25| So we have some, again, we're starting from a place of, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3205.0)|
| 0:53:30| some experience and some strength here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3210.0)|
| 0:53:32| I also want to acknowledge council in taking a big step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3212.0)|
| 0:53:36| to allow ADUs in our residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3216.0)|
| 0:53:39| And so, again, this is a type and a place where we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3219.0)|
| 0:53:42| some additional housing opportunity emerge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3222.0)|
| 0:53:44| So I want to thank council for being willing to explore that opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3224.0)|
| 0:53:48| and we're seeing that emerge now as more people see an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3228.0)|
| 0:53:52| an accessory dwelling unit, as something that can advance their improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3232.0)|
| 0:53:56| in their property and create a new housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3236.0)|
| 0:53:58| whether for their family or for a renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3238.0)|
| 0:54:03| I'll just go really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3243.0)|
| 0:54:05| You'll see some modern examples as well as historic examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3245.0)|
| 0:54:08| just to kind of give you some flavor for what's locally around already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3248.0)|
| 0:54:11| And as you mentioned, these exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3251.0)|
| 0:54:13| You've probably seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3253.0)|
| 0:54:14| So we've got townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3254.0)|
| 0:54:16| We've got historic side-by-side duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3256.0)|
| 0:54:20| Here's another one in other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3260.0)|
| 0:54:22| We've got a multiplex on Morgan Street that's kind of interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3262.0)|
| 0:54:25| maybe sort of that mid-scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3265.0)|
| 0:54:27| So these exist, and it's exciting to see when you start looking for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3267.0)|
| 0:54:31| just how many there are tucked into our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3271.0)|
| 0:54:36| So you've seen this chart, and it's in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3276.0)|
| 0:54:38| so we're not going to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3278.0)|
| 0:54:40| But we want to recognize that some of these barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3280.0)|
| 0:54:43| are probably harder to overcome than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3283.0)|
| 0:54:46| and so we're inclined to start with some of the easier ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3286.0)|
| 0:54:49| We hope you are too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3289.0)|
| 0:54:50| But really thinking about how can we make those tweaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3290.0)|
| 0:54:52| where we unlock market potential in ways that are very pragmatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3292.0)|
| 0:54:56| and very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3296.0)|
| 0:54:59| So where do we start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3299.0)|
| 0:55:01| And we'll talk a little bit about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3301.0)|
| 0:55:03| but especially where do we start from that geographic perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3303.0)|
| 0:55:08| The infill housing overlay guidelines need to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3308.0)|
| 0:55:12| They haven't been since 2003 and 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3312.0)|
| 0:55:15| were the last times that we made tweaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3315.0)|
| 0:55:17| So we think we need to do that anyway, no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3317.0)|
| 0:55:20| especially given the changes that we undertook with recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3320.0)|
| 0:55:23| So as we're doing this, we really want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3323.0)|
| 0:55:25| how do we make sure that we're being inclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3325.0)|
| 0:55:27| of the missing middle housing concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3327.0)|
| 0:55:30| So for example, the overlay really speaks predominantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3330.0)|
| 0:55:33| to single family right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3333.0)|
| 0:55:35| It mentions multifamily, but again, doesn't necessarily provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3335.0)|
| 0:55:38| that clarity that Tony alluded to as being so important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3338.0)|
| 0:55:41| for that house scale opportunity for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3341.0)|
| 0:55:45| And again, it'll be important to ensure that those design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3345.0)|
| 0:55:49| continue to align with the current zoning guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3349.0)|
| 0:55:54| As we do that, again, we want to think about the small adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3354.0)|
| 0:55:57| that we can make within that housing overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3357.0)|
| 0:56:00| And if zoning adjustments are needed, applying them, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3360.0)|
| 0:56:03| first to that very pragmatic geographic zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3363.0)|
| 0:56:06| we could think about, again, OptiCoast goes into more detail on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3366.0)|
| 0:56:09| how tweaks to things like density setbacks, the lot area minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3369.0)|
| 0:56:13| the lot width, again, trying to avoid those barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3373.0)|
| 0:56:16| that Tony presented in the first part of the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3376.0)|
| 0:56:20| So I know at least two of you are probably very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3380.0)|
| 0:56:23| with where the infill housing overlay exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3383.0)|
| 0:56:26| Councilman Thomas and Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3386.0)|
| 0:56:28| it pretty much falls exclusively into your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3388.0)|
| 0:56:32| But it is located in these three areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3392.0)|
| 0:56:35| So that's the Edgewood Park neighborhood, which I know well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3395.0)|
| 0:56:39| the Oakwood Lincoln Park neighborhood, and Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3399.0)|
| 0:56:42| So again, you think about where that Happy Holler North Central piece is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3402.0)|
| 0:56:48| and it's right in that, but it goes well beyond there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3408.0)|
| 0:56:51| to think about some of these other infill housing areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3411.0)|
| 0:56:56| We think that this is a natural place to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3416.0)|
| 0:56:58| but to contextualize, we want to underscore that the infill housing overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3418.0)|
| 0:57:03| only covers just over 3.5% of our city's RN zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3423.0)|
| 0:57:10| When you break that down in terms of what zones are within the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3430.0)|
| 0:57:14| just again, some data here to help orient you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3434.0)|
| 0:57:17| the vast, vast majority of it is RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3437.0)|
| 0:57:21| Almost 90% of the land within the overlay is RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3441.0)|
| 0:57:25| but again, that overlay is only just over 3.5% of the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3445.0)|
| 0:57:30| So again, we are very excited about the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3450.0)|
| 0:57:33| to use infill housing as a starting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3453.0)|
| 0:57:36| but I offer that as you reflect on tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3456.0)|
| 0:57:40| not just in the conversation here, but also as you get home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3460.0)|
| 0:57:43| discuss this with folks in your districts, your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3463.0)|
| 0:57:46| we really want your feedback about how we might look beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3466.0)|
| 0:57:49| the infill housing overlay as it exists today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3469.0)|
| 0:57:52| to determine if there are other areas, other geographic lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3472.0)|
| 0:57:56| that we could consider drawing or tools that we might use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3476.0)|
| 0:57:59| to focus our efforts on where it most makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3479.0)|
| 0:58:02| but at the same time not be only constrained to that 3.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3482.0)|
| 0:58:06| of the land that exists within the overlay now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3486.0)|
| 0:58:09| So again, reflect on that tonight or elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3489.0)|
| 0:58:12| but we want to continue this conversation with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3492.0)|
| 0:58:14| as we think about what those appropriate areas could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3494.0)|
| 0:58:19| And then I'll end here kind of on the incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3499.0)|
| 0:58:21| and how we are able to encourage missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3501.0)|
| 0:58:25| with some tools that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3505.0)|
| 0:58:27| So the great news is that we think that missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3507.0)|
| 0:58:30| aligns really well with our development priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3510.0)|
| 0:58:33| and are great candidates for the city's public-private partnership programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3513.0)|
| 0:58:37| that we brought several to council already for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3517.0)|
| 0:58:40| So again, these are on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3520.0)|
| 0:58:42| I won't go over them here, but there's a lot of alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3522.0)|
| 0:58:45| when we think about infill, when we think about interesting architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3525.0)|
| 0:58:48| So we're excited to see hopefully more opportunity for pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3528.0)|
| 0:58:54| and some of our other development incentive tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3534.0)|
| 0:58:57| to support these types of smaller-scale and medium-scale housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3537.0)|
| 0:59:01| And I'll also mention here that, you know, as council knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3541.0)|
| 0:59:04| we've been really successful at using this public-private partnership process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3544.0)|
| 0:59:08| to negotiate with the recipients of those incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3548.0)|
| 0:59:11| to include workforce- and income-based affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3551.0)|
| 0:59:15| even at those smaller scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3555.0)|
| 0:59:17| So again, this is an opportunity to link both the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3557.0)|
| 0:59:20| around housing supply, but also one directly with affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3560.0)|
| 0:59:26| Again, going to ideas we've already talked a little bit about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3566.0)|
| 0:59:29| but we also are excited to think about showcase projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3569.0)|
| 0:59:32| So where are there opportunities for partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3572.0)|
| 0:59:35| where we can really highlight success stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3575.0)|
| 0:59:38| utilizing tools that exist within the Affordable Housing Fund, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3578.0)|
| 0:59:43| and within our existing or new housing and neighborhood development programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3583.0)|
| 0:59:47| And again, the city owns a lot of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3587.0)|
| 0:59:50| some of which is already in the Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3590.0)|
| 0:59:52| some of which is in partnership with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3592.0)|
| 0:59:54| So we want to look at those opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3594.0)|
| 0:59:56| to use our own properties that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3596.0)|
| 0:59:59| to how do we return them to the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3599.0)|
| 1:00:01| in a way that also showcases the opportunity for this type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3601.0)|
| 1:00:06| And the last one we'll go into is an intriguing best practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3606.0)|
| 1:00:09| that harpens back to those Sears catalog days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3609.0)|
| 1:00:13| where you could order your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3613.0)|
| 1:00:15| And more and more cities are using this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3615.0)|
| 1:00:17| and it's one that we're really interested in exploring for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3617.0)|
| 1:00:21| And that's where you can create a catalog of context-appropriate designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3621.0)|
| 1:00:25| Sometimes you can pre-approve those designs to help streamline the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3625.0)|
| 1:00:29| but you allow easier access to small-scale developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3629.0)|
| 1:00:32| who might be interested in building missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3632.0)|
| 1:00:35| We want these to be easily replicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3635.0)|
| 1:00:37| but also easily tweaked to fit the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3637.0)|
| 1:00:40| and something that can be repeated block after block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3640.0)|
| 1:00:43| and have enough diversity that you don't get tired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3643.0)|
| 1:00:45| of seeing the same house over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3645.0)|
| 1:00:47| So it's the modern equivalent of those templates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3647.0)|
| 1:00:49| that can avoid the cost, perhaps, of an expensive architect on every project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3649.0)|
| 1:00:54| And we also want to have that high-quality design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3654.0)|
| 1:00:57| with respect for the historic character of different neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3657.0)|
| 1:01:01| So the benefits here in terms of what makes that an incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3661.0)|
| 1:01:03| one is that in other cities it's been shown to help reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3663.0)|
| 1:01:06| the architectural fees associated with those schematics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3666.0)|
| 1:01:09| and the construction documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3669.0)|
| 1:01:11| That helps streamline the approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3671.0)|
| 1:01:13| Our teams can be familiar with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3673.0)|
| 1:01:15| and be assured that they've had some of that design integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3675.0)|
| 1:01:20| built in from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3680.0)|
| 1:01:21| That helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3681.0)|
| 1:01:22| And then it also creates potential for pre-approvals in certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3682.0)|
| 1:01:25| or to help otherwise fast-track folks through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3685.0)|
| 1:01:29| And you could think about that in the context of infill housing, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3689.0)|
| 1:01:34| if something's already been through design review board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3694.0)|
| 1:01:37| through a template process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3697.0)|
| 1:01:39| and that streamlines the process on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3699.0)|
| 1:01:41| for someone who chooses to utilize that template.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3701.0)|
| 1:01:43| It's interesting when we looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3703.0)|
| 1:01:46| and we realized that we had something kind of similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3706.0)|
| 1:01:48| although not quite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3708.0)|
| 1:01:49| when KCDC developed Mechanicsville Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3709.0)|
| 1:01:53| So that was, again, a place that was all built through KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3713.0)|
| 1:01:57| but it had a set of plans for those visually attractive duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3717.0)|
| 1:02:01| The design guidelines were very contextually appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3721.0)|
| 1:02:04| It was moderate density, and it was a collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3724.0)|
| 1:02:07| So it's not exactly what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3727.0)|
| 1:02:09| because it was a unique public housing-driven project through KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3729.0)|
| 1:02:13| but it was, I think, a 47-page book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3733.0)|
| 1:02:16| with 24 different styles of pre-approved plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3736.0)|
| 1:02:20| And so we could think about how to bring or use that as a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3740.0)|
| 1:02:23| and bring similar types of catalogs for missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3743.0)|
| 1:02:27| You can see some of the examples there of how that has helped streamline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3747.0)|
| 1:02:31| And if you drive through Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3751.0)|
| 1:02:33| I think you'll see the familiarity with this type of look and aesthetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3753.0)|
| 1:02:37| There's also a great case study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3757.0)|
| 1:02:40| that's been written about on a few kind of planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3760.0)|
| 1:02:45| best practice publications on South Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3765.0)|
| 1:02:48| So this was initiated in 2008 as a collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3768.0)|
| 1:02:52| and it was designed to create a clear process for full approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3772.0)|
| 1:02:56| a variety of housing forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3776.0)|
| 1:02:59| lower the cost or reduce the cost for construction documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3779.0)|
| 1:03:03| and specifically create infill and economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3783.0)|
| 1:03:07| for locals who lived in South Bend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3787.0)|
| 1:03:09| and were interested in improving their homes or improving their properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3789.0)|
| 1:03:12| but also really supported smaller developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3792.0)|
| 1:03:15| who are the ones that are more likely to pursue missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3795.0)|
| 1:03:18| on a standalone or individual lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3798.0)|
| 1:03:21| versus a multi-lot larger greenfield project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3801.0)|
| 1:03:24| What we also really liked about the South Bend example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3804.0)|
| 1:03:27| is that in doing this, they went further to create even a support network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3807.0)|
| 1:03:30| for those smaller builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3810.0)|
| 1:03:32| and that included a series of workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3812.0)|
| 1:03:34| on how to utilize the pre-approved plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3814.0)|
| 1:03:37| where they would need additional approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3817.0)|
| 1:03:40| and in what circumstances how to navigate situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3820.0)|
| 1:03:43| that are a little more unique because they do always come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3823.0)|
| 1:03:46| and mentoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3826.0)|
| 1:03:48| So really thinking about this as a wraparound opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3828.0)|
| 1:03:51| to support a smaller and medium-scale developer community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3831.0)|
| 1:03:54| who may not be as, you know, experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3834.0)|
| 1:03:57| in navigating some of the systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3837.0)|
| 1:04:00| especially in a new context like missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3840.0)|
| 1:04:03| So again, recognizing that there's a historic precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3843.0)|
| 1:04:06| for this type of approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3846.0)|
| 1:04:08| and that we have some cities that we can learn from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3848.0)|
| 1:04:11| in pursuing this type of opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3851.0)|
| 1:04:14| Again, this is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3854.0)|
| 1:04:16| This is still from the South Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3856.0)|
| 1:04:18| but you think about where in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3858.0)|
| 1:04:20| where you might have several vacant lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3860.0)|
| 1:04:22| where you could utilize this catalog approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3862.0)|
| 1:04:24| to promote a consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3864.0)|
| 1:04:27| while also helping more folks access the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3867.0)|
| 1:04:30| to infill those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3870.0)|
| 1:04:32| and turn them back into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3872.0)|
| 1:04:35| versus a vacant lot or a single-unit home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3875.0)|
| 1:04:39| but rather something that allows additional housing opportunity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3879.0)|
| 1:04:42| So the idea is to create opportunity to fill the gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3882.0)|
| 1:04:45| while gently increasing the density where you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3885.0)|
| 1:04:49| And that's just a couple of examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3889.0)|
| 1:04:52| from some of the smaller apartment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3892.0)|
| 1:04:55| So I'll end here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3895.0)|
| 1:04:57| and would love to have some additional questions and discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3897.0)|
| 1:05:00| but I want to emphasize that the stage that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3900.0)|
| 1:05:03| with this conversation is very much around education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3903.0)|
| 1:05:06| engagement, and evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3906.0)|
| 1:05:08| So we're in this early stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3908.0)|
| 1:05:10| where we want to catalyze the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3910.0)|
| 1:05:12| identify those champions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3912.0)|
| 1:05:14| hear reflections from both you and the constituents that we serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3914.0)|
| 1:05:17| and then also continue to evaluate more specific proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3917.0)|
| 1:05:20| whether through our existing programs that we run in our departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3920.0)|
| 1:05:23| but also through potential policy tweaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3923.0)|
| 1:05:25| and legislative partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3925.0)|
| 1:05:27| that we would need to undertake with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3927.0)|
| 1:05:29| So I'll stop there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3929.0)|
| 1:05:31| and we're happy, both Tony and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3931.0)|
| 1:05:33| to have additional questions and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3933.0)|
| 1:05:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3935.0)|
| 1:05:36| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3936.0)|
| 1:05:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3937.0)|
| 1:05:38| So, Ms. Gill, and I want to throw this out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3938.0)|
| 1:05:41| because I think what I heard you say was infill housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3941.0)|
| 1:05:44| is one criteria that we could maybe examine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3944.0)|
| 1:05:47| to attach some potential changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3947.0)|
| 1:05:50| to restrict it to particular geographic areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3950.0)|
| 1:05:54| And I know you and I had a conversation about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3954.0)|
| 1:05:57| so I want to throw out food for thought for my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3957.0)|
| 1:05:59| to go home and sleep on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3959.0)|
| 1:06:01| and think more about in further examination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3961.0)|
| 1:06:04| after we talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3964.0)|
| 1:06:06| That is way too restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3966.0)|
| 1:06:08| So things that I've been mulling over would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3968.0)|
| 1:06:14| anything on the ward maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3974.0)|
| 1:06:17| although I want those to go in the garbage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3977.0)|
| 1:06:19| so I guess I should strike that comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3979.0)|
| 1:06:21| prior to a certain date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3981.0)|
| 1:06:23| infill housing, neighborhood conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3983.0)|
| 1:06:25| historic zoning, overlays, anything with overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3985.0)|
| 1:06:28| but, again, still minute piece of the pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3988.0)|
| 1:06:32| I wonder if we could potentially approach it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3992.0)|
| 1:06:34| within certain geographic constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3994.0)|
| 1:06:37| maybe within 640 bounds on this direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3997.0)|
| 1:06:41| and within something to the south or the east or the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4001.0)|
| 1:06:44| kind of pick something on each side, east, west, north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4004.0)|
| 1:06:48| and then has alley access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4008.0)|
| 1:06:52| within five to ten minutes' walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4012.0)|
| 1:06:54| from a certain bus stop level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4014.0)|
| 1:06:59| I don't know if that's something that we can use as a criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4019.0)|
| 1:07:03| but going back and looking at the infill housing piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4023.0)|
| 1:07:07| huge swaths of area that have incredible alley access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4027.0)|
| 1:07:12| and grid-like formatting from the 1800s and early 1900s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4032.0)|
| 1:07:17| and just doesn't meet that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4037.0)|
| 1:07:19| Park Ridge is a great example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4039.0)|
| 1:07:22| It has a small piece of its pie that has an H1 overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4042.0)|
| 1:07:25| and then the rest of it's got nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4045.0)|
| 1:07:28| And so I know some folks over there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4048.0)|
| 1:07:32| want to be able to do some of this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4052.0)|
| 1:07:34| and that would eliminate them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4054.0)|
| 1:07:36| and they would be very unhappy, as they've informed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4056.0)|
| 1:07:40| So the other thing that I would like to ask our guest from Opticos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4060.0)|
| 1:07:45| I'm going to switch gears a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4065.0)|
| 1:07:47| You talked about defining multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4067.0)|
| 1:07:50| and I looked at our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4070.0)|
| 1:07:52| and we don't do a really good job of defining multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4072.0)|
| 1:07:55| So talk a little bit about what you mean by defining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4075.0)|
| 1:07:58| Do you mean not by density, but help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4078.0)|
| 1:08:02| Yeah, thank you for the question, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4082.0)|
| 1:08:05| You know, as I was showing with the pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4085.0)|
| 1:08:08| both of those are multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4088.0)|
| 1:08:11| And so what I mean by defining is to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4091.0)|
| 1:08:15| you could simply define it by saying what missing middle is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4095.0)|
| 1:08:20| and then letting the rest of multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4100.0)|
| 1:08:22| be currently as you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4102.0)|
| 1:08:24| Or you could try to define it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4104.0)|
| 1:08:26| but it would probably be more effective to simply just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4106.0)|
| 1:08:30| multifamily is this big category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4110.0)|
| 1:08:32| Right now we're just trying to define missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4112.0)|
| 1:08:34| so it isn't lumped in with the whole category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4114.0)|
| 1:08:37| And then you could just define missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4117.0)|
| 1:08:39| in the ways that we're describing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4119.0)|
| 1:08:41| and the way we recommended in the scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4121.0)|
| 1:08:43| Okay, so do we not define multifamily housing or things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4123.0)|
| 1:08:47| by like height, mass, fate, shape, form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4127.0)|
| 1:08:50| Yeah, you do, but you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4130.0)|
| 1:08:53| It's just that in order to not foreclose on possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4133.0)|
| 1:08:58| you're going to end up defining it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4138.0)|
| 1:09:00| as the maximum that it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4140.0)|
| 1:09:02| So, for example, if the max multifamily building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4142.0)|
| 1:09:06| you could have is a five-story building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4146.0)|
| 1:09:08| you're going to say multifamily can be up to five stories tall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4148.0)|
| 1:09:11| and it's going to be, you could define it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4151.0)|
| 1:09:19| It'll be difficult to attach enough descriptive terms to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4159.0)|
| 1:09:25| without cinching people into a certain outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4165.0)|
| 1:09:29| because there's so many varieties of multifamily housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4169.0)|
| 1:09:32| after missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4172.0)|
| 1:09:34| Okay, so I'm going to ask this last question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4174.0)|
| 1:09:37| and I'll turn myself off for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4177.0)|
| 1:09:39| We don't define things in our code by number of stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4179.0)|
| 1:09:43| We define things by height limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4183.0)|
| 1:09:45| I believe 25, 35, 40, 45, I can't remember the exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4185.0)|
| 1:09:50| So is that not how other cities, is that not optimal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4190.0)|
| 1:09:54| Is that not what you've seen in other cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4194.0)|
| 1:09:56| So multifamily is defined all over the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4196.0)|
| 1:10:00| There's a wide variety of solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4200.0)|
| 1:10:04| of how people or cities define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4204.0)|
| 1:10:07| That's why I'm suggesting that multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4207.0)|
| 1:10:10| that you only really define missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4210.0)|
| 1:10:13| and let multifamily just rely on the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4213.0)|
| 1:10:16| and everything else because there's so many different varieties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4216.0)|
| 1:10:19| of multifamily after missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4219.0)|
| 1:10:21| it'll be difficult to arrive at a definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4221.0)|
| 1:10:26| that everybody can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4226.0)|
| 1:10:28| Okay, so just for clarity, in our code we define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4228.0)|
| 1:10:32| what's allowed in certain zones by a numerical value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4232.0)|
| 1:10:36| and you have spoken in number of stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4236.0)|
| 1:10:39| And I understand if I talk to an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4239.0)|
| 1:10:41| they'll be like, oh yeah, this is how many stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4241.0)|
| 1:10:43| you get in this number of feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4243.0)|
| 1:10:45| Are you saying, and in codes where you've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4245.0)|
| 1:10:47| in other cities, are they defining things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4247.0)|
| 1:10:49| by number of stories or number of feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4249.0)|
| 1:10:51| Okay, so I'm sorry, I misunderstood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4251.0)|
| 1:10:54| how you were asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4254.0)|
| 1:10:56| You were talking about defining, I thought you meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4256.0)|
| 1:10:58| like describe what this term means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4258.0)|
| 1:11:01| what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4261.0)|
| 1:11:02| I might have asked you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4262.0)|
| 1:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4263.0)|
| 1:11:04| Now I'm asking you about stories versus feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4264.0)|
| 1:11:06| Okay, so there's the written definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4266.0)|
| 1:11:09| and that's what I was first responding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4269.0)|
| 1:11:12| In terms of defining it in terms of standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4272.0)|
| 1:11:16| what we do, what we recommend is that you identify height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4276.0)|
| 1:11:21| but identify it to the eave and let the top of the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4281.0)|
| 1:11:26| be as tall as it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4286.0)|
| 1:11:28| They build more roof than they need to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4288.0)|
| 1:11:30| Just let the roof be, let it be what it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4290.0)|
| 1:11:34| but regulate to the eave because that's what people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4294.0)|
| 1:11:38| perceive when it's too big is where's that eave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4298.0)|
| 1:11:41| how tall are those two stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4301.0)|
| 1:11:43| That's when people say it's too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4303.0)|
| 1:11:45| So you want to regulate the eave height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4305.0)|
| 1:11:48| That's what people are going to perceive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4308.0)|
| 1:11:50| And then if you want to regulate overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4310.0)|
| 1:11:52| you still can regulate it overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4312.0)|
| 1:11:53| but the eave height is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4313.0)|
| 1:11:55| The other two things are the maximum width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4315.0)|
| 1:11:58| that the missing middle buildings can be on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4318.0)|
| 1:12:01| and the maximum depth down the side of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4321.0)|
| 1:12:04| So today in talking with planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4324.0)|
| 1:12:06| we were talking about what that means in practical terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4326.0)|
| 1:12:10| because most cities use lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4330.0)|
| 1:12:13| Lot coverage doesn't guarantee, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4333.0)|
| 1:12:17| it's not your code only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4337.0)|
| 1:12:19| Every code that uses lot coverage has this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4339.0)|
| 1:12:22| Lot coverage does not prevent from a building being too long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4342.0)|
| 1:12:26| down one side yard and you're in your backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4346.0)|
| 1:12:28| and you say, wow, look at that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4348.0)|
| 1:12:30| It's like a cruise ship sitting next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4350.0)|
| 1:12:32| I live next to one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4352.0)|
| 1:12:33| Okay, so you know what I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4353.0)|
| 1:12:35| but it complies with the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4355.0)|
| 1:12:37| The more effective thing is to regulate building footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4357.0)|
| 1:12:41| and just by the way, the missing middle building types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4361.0)|
| 1:12:45| don't need the same amount of lot coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4365.0)|
| 1:12:48| that most cities currently allow in their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4368.0)|
| 1:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4371.0)|
| 1:12:54| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4374.0)|
| 1:12:58| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4378.0)|
| 1:13:00| It was mentioned that the administration does not want to recreate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4380.0)|
| 1:13:04| the recode process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4384.0)|
| 1:13:07| but I do believe some expectations have been set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4387.0)|
| 1:13:12| going through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4392.0)|
| 1:13:15| What is the public engagement plan for whatever proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4395.0)|
| 1:13:23| that the administration plans to bring towards city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4403.0)|
| 1:13:28| So I think engagement starts today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4408.0)|
| 1:13:31| The mayor referenced our intention to think about housing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4411.0)|
| 1:13:38| over the coming year and this is a big priority for our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4418.0)|
| 1:13:43| Mr. Perez presented this morning at a great event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4423.0)|
| 1:13:47| hosted by the Area Association of Realtors that began this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4427.0)|
| 1:13:50| and so again, we're very much in this engage and evaluate stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4430.0)|
| 1:13:54| To the best practices that Tony presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4434.0)|
| 1:13:56| we really think that there's some education that we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4436.0)|
| 1:13:59| in terms of broader community understanding of missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4439.0)|
| 1:14:03| and the places in which it's most effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4443.0)|
| 1:14:05| and why it can be beneficial to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4445.0)|
| 1:14:08| When it comes to specific proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4448.0)|
| 1:14:09| obviously there's a legislative process to change our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4449.0)|
| 1:14:12| that's going to require just by default some points and checkpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4452.0)|
| 1:14:17| both with council as well as with planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4457.0)|
| 1:14:20| So those would be part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4460.0)|
| 1:14:22| I think that we are interested in wanting to be both nimble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4462.0)|
| 1:14:27| while also being intentional about bringing folks along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4467.0)|
| 1:14:31| so that folks are supportive of these strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4471.0)|
| 1:14:34| rather than feeling surprised and scared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4474.0)|
| 1:14:37| to see these types of opportunities emerge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4477.0)|
| 1:14:40| So again, we're at the beginning of a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4480.0)|
| 1:14:42| but we don't have any specific proposals for you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4482.0)|
| 1:14:45| and so we'll be developing those as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4485.0)|
| 1:14:47| and understanding what the interests and the appetites are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4487.0)|
| 1:14:50| as well as the concerns that you or constituents might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4490.0)|
| 1:14:54| I'm happy to see a discussion happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4494.0)|
| 1:14:57| because I do feel that we need one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4497.0)|
| 1:15:00| and I feel like we're all concerned about the housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4500.0)|
| 1:15:07| and without a plan in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4507.0)|
| 1:15:10| we run the risk of making rash zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4510.0)|
| 1:15:15| all throughout the community that aren't following a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4515.0)|
| 1:15:22| and may present some negative examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4522.0)|
| 1:15:28| of incorporating missing metal more into our housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4528.0)|
| 1:15:34| I encourage also other processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4534.0)|
| 1:15:38| I know that there's a, and I was in support of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4538.0)|
| 1:15:43| to create a review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4543.0)|
| 1:15:46| for the South Waterfront form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4546.0)|
| 1:15:49| but in addition to the administrative process within that code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4549.0)|
| 1:15:54| there have been concerns from residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4554.0)|
| 1:15:57| about the scale of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4557.0)|
| 1:15:59| that have gone into some of those residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4559.0)|
| 1:16:02| and how did that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4562.0)|
| 1:16:04| And I don't have the answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4564.0)|
| 1:16:06| but a process like this could be an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4566.0)|
| 1:16:11| to examine where we have incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4571.0)|
| 1:16:14| and had plans to incorporate more missing metal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4574.0)|
| 1:16:18| into our housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4578.0)|
| 1:16:20| but weren't able to prevent the larger scale developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4580.0)|
| 1:16:25| that folks were worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4585.0)|
| 1:16:29| And I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4589.0)|
| 1:16:32| a final point that I wanted to make is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4592.0)|
| 1:16:36| final for now at least we'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4596.0)|
| 1:16:40| I can see and have read reports myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4600.0)|
| 1:16:45| where, you know, having a greater mix of housing choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4605.0)|
| 1:16:52| will introduce housing options at various price points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4612.0)|
| 1:16:59| But to truly address the affordable housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4619.0)|
| 1:17:02| that we're having, and as you stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4622.0)|
| 1:17:07| the fact that we are attracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4627.0)|
| 1:17:09| so many new residents at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4629.0)|
| 1:17:12| and residents who seem to be able to afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4632.0)|
| 1:17:17| a higher cost of living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4637.0)|
| 1:17:19| I still push us as a city to be very intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4639.0)|
| 1:17:22| about affordable housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4642.0)|
| 1:17:26| And even within this missing metal plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4646.0)|
| 1:17:29| I like the discussion about looking at the Homemakers Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4649.0)|
| 1:17:32| and how we might be able to use current tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4652.0)|
| 1:17:36| to increase that missing metal housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4656.0)|
| 1:17:39| and hopefully, you know, partner with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4659.0)|
| 1:17:43| partner with KCDC to use their tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4663.0)|
| 1:17:48| But we need that, you know, rent and home ownership pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4668.0)|
| 1:17:55| that fits with our current residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4675.0)|
| 1:17:58| And we have studies that have shown us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4678.0)|
| 1:18:02| the average income in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4682.0)|
| 1:18:05| what that would be able to afford in terms of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4685.0)|
| 1:18:08| and we've got to use our tools to create housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4688.0)|
| 1:18:12| that meets that price point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4692.0)|
| 1:18:14| and that's a very, very low price point to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4694.0)|
| 1:18:18| And so I'm very in support of increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4698.0)|
| 1:18:20| our missing metal housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4700.0)|
| 1:18:23| but as a way to make our city more vibrant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4703.0)|
| 1:18:27| not as the solution to our affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4707.0)|
| 1:18:33| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4713.0)|
| 1:18:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4714.0)|
| 1:18:36| One thing that really appealed to me in this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4716.0)|
| 1:18:40| I really think I would encourage us to work hard to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4720.0)|
| 1:18:45| is the pre-approved plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4725.0)|
| 1:18:47| I think when we talk about scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4727.0)|
| 1:18:50| sometimes talking in the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4730.0)|
| 1:18:52| isn't what makes people feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4732.0)|
| 1:18:54| and it isn't what makes people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4734.0)|
| 1:18:56| what this missing metal looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4736.0)|
| 1:18:58| But if there are plans available that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4738.0)|
| 1:19:01| oh, that looks like a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4741.0)|
| 1:19:03| it looks just like a house in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4743.0)|
| 1:19:05| but maybe there are more units in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4745.0)|
| 1:19:07| I think that can be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4747.0)|
| 1:19:09| And as we're trying to grow, to Ms. Parker's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4749.0)|
| 1:19:12| more affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4752.0)|
| 1:19:14| I do think it might entice more small homebuilders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4754.0)|
| 1:19:21| back into the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4761.0)|
| 1:19:23| I lived through the recession of 2008 as a banker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4763.0)|
| 1:19:26| and we didn't build houses in here after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4766.0)|
| 1:19:29| So many small homebuilders went out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4769.0)|
| 1:19:32| They either joined Big Pep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4772.0)|
| 1:19:34| and for years we just weren't building houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4774.0)|
| 1:19:37| And if we can have something that doesn't cost a homebuilder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4777.0)|
| 1:19:41| a lot of money to get approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4781.0)|
| 1:19:43| I think you can entice more builders back into the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4783.0)|
| 1:19:47| that will also increase supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4787.0)|
| 1:19:49| So I like the idea of the pre-approved visual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4789.0)|
| 1:19:54| of what it should look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4794.0)|
| 1:19:56| I think that will also help the community understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4796.0)|
| 1:20:00| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4800.0)|
| 1:20:01| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4801.0)|
| 1:20:02| Just a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4802.0)|
| 1:20:04| On the blighted property and homemakers program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4804.0)|
| 1:20:07| what's the thoughts on the best way to increase speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4807.0)|
| 1:20:11| of conversion of those properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4811.0)|
| 1:20:13| I know the city's invested recently in new software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4813.0)|
| 1:20:16| for development applications and processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4816.0)|
| 1:20:18| but particularly related to blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4818.0)|
| 1:20:21| is it funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4821.0)|
| 1:20:22| Is it process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4822.0)|
| 1:20:23| What's the biggest barrier for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4823.0)|
| 1:20:26| I welcome insights from our housing and neighborhood team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4826.0)|
| 1:20:29| but I think you all are oftentimes part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4829.0)|
| 1:20:33| that it takes to acquire a blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4833.0)|
| 1:20:36| and I think we've had some not-so-distant past council discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4836.0)|
| 1:20:40| when it actually comes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4840.0)|
| 1:20:41| I mean, there's a long process that the city must go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4841.0)|
| 1:20:44| before we can acquire a chronic problem property, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4844.0)|
| 1:20:48| Homemakers is a little bit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4848.0)|
| 1:20:50| homemakers is the way we get rid of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4850.0)|
| 1:20:52| Chronic problem properties and blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4852.0)|
| 1:20:54| are the ways that we acquire properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4854.0)|
| 1:20:56| So let me ask, does anyone want to kind of shed some light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4856.0)|
| 1:21:00| on this concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4860.0)|
| 1:21:01| But I think there's a couple ideas already kind of kicking around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4861.0)|
| 1:21:05| of ways that we can make sure people know about those opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4865.0)|
| 1:21:09| and potentially even think about the Homemakers program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4869.0)|
| 1:21:12| as a way, to your point, Councilwoman Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4872.0)|
| 1:21:14| of getting small builders and builders of small homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4874.0)|
| 1:21:18| back into the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4878.0)|
| 1:21:19| really trying to make sure folks are aware of the opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4879.0)|
| 1:21:21| and I think Carter Hull in my office just today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4881.0)|
| 1:21:24| has gotten them all into a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4884.0)|
| 1:21:27| So we're excited to be able to share, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4887.0)|
| 1:21:29| the opportunity visually as well as through the program guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4889.0)|
| 1:21:35| I just want to add to Kevin DuBose, housing and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4895.0)|
| 1:21:39| I want to add to what Erin was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4899.0)|
| 1:21:42| We kind of comprehensively need to look at both the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4902.0)|
| 1:21:46| blighted property, chronic problem properties, the Homemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4906.0)|
| 1:21:52| Homemakers is a tried and true method in terms of acquiring lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4912.0)|
| 1:21:58| and getting them into the hands of developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4918.0)|
| 1:22:01| But the idea of it in its inception was to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4921.0)|
| 1:22:06| homeownership single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4926.0)|
| 1:22:10| And so I recently had lunch with a developer who, you know, told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4930.0)|
| 1:22:15| He said, hey, we need to look at it with the lens of missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4935.0)|
| 1:22:21| and see what modifications we need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4941.0)|
| 1:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4945.0)|
| 1:22:26| And the other two questions I had, one was related to ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4946.0)|
| 1:22:31| How many ADUs do we think have been built since we authorized that in the recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4951.0)|
| 1:22:41| Where my planner's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4961.0)|
| 1:22:44| Ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4964.0)|
| 1:22:47| This is Brian Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4967.0)|
| 1:22:54| To be honest with you, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4974.0)|
| 1:22:57| I honestly don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4977.0)|
| 1:23:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4980.0)|
| 1:23:01| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4981.0)|
| 1:23:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4982.0)|
| 1:23:03| Thanks for taking a swing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4983.0)|
| 1:23:05| Maybe we can find that out as a follow-up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4985.0)|
| 1:23:09| The last question I had was related to pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4989.0)|
| 1:23:14| You know, I'm of the opinion that where pilots meet these key development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4994.0)|
| 1:23:20| priorities for the administration, they should scale up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5000.0)|
| 1:23:25| So talk about any smaller pilots that have come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5005.0)|
| 1:23:30| Ideally, those are coming through more frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5010.0)|
| 1:23:33| We've lowered the bar for what types of smaller developments can apply for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5013.0)|
| 1:23:40| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5020.0)|
| 1:23:41| And have we seen success in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5021.0)|
| 1:23:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5023.0)|
| 1:23:44| So I think I don't know that historically we would have said there was a bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5024.0)|
| 1:23:47| but certainly based on how we define the terms of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5027.0)|
| 1:23:51| folks are seeing a pathway perhaps for some of those smaller projects that they didn't necessarily see before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5031.0)|
| 1:23:56| So I don't know what's come before you already since we've really revised those pathways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5036.0)|
| 1:24:02| but we do have several in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5042.0)|
| 1:24:04| And, again, I want to emphasize here that we, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5044.0)|
| 1:24:08| this is a tool that should flex regardless of the size of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5048.0)|
| 1:24:12| And the fees scale, right, down with the value of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5052.0)|
| 1:24:16| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5056.0)|
| 1:24:17| I don't know if the fees scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5057.0)|
| 1:24:18| They do, I'm being told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5058.0)|
| 1:24:19| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5059.0)|
| 1:24:20| So, again, really trying to make it something that can flex with the size of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5060.0)|
| 1:24:23| Because that's one of the things I try to do when I talk to smaller developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5063.0)|
| 1:24:26| is encourage them to apply for pilots just like big developers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5066.0)|
| 1:24:29| We've got a process for that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5069.0)|
| 1:24:31| We've scaled down the fees so that it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5071.0)|
| 1:24:33| So anybody watching at home, I encourage you to give it a shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5073.0)|
| 1:24:36| and let us know if it doesn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5076.0)|
| 1:24:38| And I just want to, no question but comment, I think the South Bend case study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5078.0)|
| 1:24:44| I think the Councilman Fugate's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5084.0)|
| 1:24:47| I think similar to the Urban League's efforts to involve minority-owned contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5087.0)|
| 1:24:52| in the multi-use stadium build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5092.0)|
| 1:24:55| I think this seems like an opportunity to get a group together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5095.0)|
| 1:25:01| narrowly focus on a repeatable process and make it easier, cheaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5101.0)|
| 1:25:05| and hopefully with better software, more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5105.0)|
| 1:25:10| So that's all for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5110.0)|
| 1:25:11| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5111.0)|
| 1:25:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5112.0)|
| 1:25:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5113.0)|
| 1:25:14| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5114.0)|
| 1:25:15| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5115.0)|
| 1:25:17| Is there any way to go back to slide 11, page 11 in our hand, the pie chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5117.0)|
| 1:25:24| the next pie chart, that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5124.0)|
| 1:25:29| And this just brought a thought to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5129.0)|
| 1:25:33| So it looks like just from the legend, the color code legend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5133.0)|
| 1:25:39| and by the math there's roughly about 3% that should be RN5 in there in the infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5139.0)|
| 1:25:46| Oh, yep, we might have dropped that one, but I'll pass your math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5146.0)|
| 1:25:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5149.0)|
| 1:25:51| But it just sort of raised a thought for me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5151.0)|
| 1:25:56| And, again, I mean the infill overlay is such a small percentage of just the land in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5156.0)|
| 1:26:03| But on RN5 I know oftentimes when something is presented to us with a request to rezone to RN5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5163.0)|
| 1:26:17| we kind of shudder thinking about the density of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5177.0)|
| 1:26:21| But going, and there was a recent rezone before us recently that ended up being RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5181.0)|
| 1:26:30| with the proposal of duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5190.0)|
| 1:26:33| But, you know, we'll take fourplexes, you know, within the presentation that was just done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5193.0)|
| 1:26:40| And generally, if I'm not mistaking, that generally is going to require an RN5 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5200.0)|
| 1:26:48| And so I feel like sometimes, you know, which is a great opportunity to make meaningful impact, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5208.0)|
| 1:26:56| I mean, I think when we think RN5 we think about vast development and, you know, hundreds of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5216.0)|
| 1:27:04| and just I think the visual of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5224.0)|
| 1:27:10| And with that, however, I feel like we've pigeonholed our ability to really make that meaningful impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5230.0)|
| 1:27:21| of being able to add a myriad of different types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5241.0)|
| 1:27:26| So that would just be, I mean, I know that, you know, sometimes looking at that and it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5246.0)|
| 1:27:32| well, okay, well, developers proposing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5252.0)|
| 1:27:35| But, you know, once it's rezoned, then the fear is, well, they won't stick to this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5255.0)|
| 1:27:40| or they're going to max it out, which isn't, I really believe and know and feel like we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5260.0)|
| 1:27:48| developers who are committed to and intentional about addressing this missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5268.0)|
| 1:27:57| And I just, you know, would encourage, you know, us to really think more broadly and thoughtfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5277.0)|
| 1:28:06| and then, you know, win these opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5286.0)|
| 1:28:10| And if it's a higher rezone to really look at the potential to address and make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5290.0)|
| 1:28:18| make the impact we need and make the inroads we need to be able to accommodate more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5298.0)|
| 1:28:25| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5305.0)|
| 1:28:26| I mean, just having seen some situations in the past where we did have a really good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5306.0)|
| 1:28:34| to add more housing in a consistent, you know, fourplex or multiplex way without doing a high rise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5314.0)|
| 1:28:42| or big apartment buildings that, you know, I think we've kind of missed some good opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5322.0)|
| 1:28:48| So I would just like to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5328.0)|
| 1:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5332.0)|
| 1:28:53| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5333.0)|
| 1:28:56| Just a comment first and then I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5336.0)|
| 1:28:58| We've talked about density a little bit earlier and density is not necessarily a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5338.0)|
| 1:29:04| And, of course, in a lot of instances it's a really good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5344.0)|
| 1:29:08| Downtown, I don't know that it could be, you could have a problem with more density, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5348.0)|
| 1:29:14| But density is important, but it's important inversely to infrastructure, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5354.0)|
| 1:29:23| And what I see from your proposals is that you're proposing these missing middle units in places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5363.0)|
| 1:29:34| that have amenities already or can spur amenities relatively quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5374.0)|
| 1:29:42| Is that right, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5382.0)|
| 1:29:45| That's correct, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5385.0)|
| 1:29:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5387.0)|
| 1:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5388.0)|
| 1:29:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5389.0)|
| 1:29:50| And just to expand on that, often, and you'll get this question, so that's why I want to respond with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5390.0)|
| 1:29:59| People will ask you, wait a second, you're allowing a fourplex where a house is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5399.0)|
| 1:30:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5404.0)|
| 1:30:05| And one of the things we've been told by infrastructure, out in California they have to do a bunch of reports about every project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5405.0)|
| 1:30:11| And what the people told us over and over is they said, if you're putting in three or fourplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5411.0)|
| 1:30:16| maybe even a fiveplex where a single family house is, chances are there are already three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5416.0)|
| 1:30:22| or five people living in that house anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5422.0)|
| 1:30:24| So the net change is not really significant about the impact on sewer or water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5424.0)|
| 1:30:29| You know, once you get above four or five, then that same case can't be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5429.0)|
| 1:30:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5434.0)|
| 1:30:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5435.0)|
| 1:30:36| And I think if I understood you, you were saying that density just shouldn't be across the board the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5436.0)|
| 1:30:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5442.0)|
| 1:30:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5443.0)|
| 1:30:44| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5444.0)|
| 1:30:45| It's site specific, you know, and so we have to constantly evaluate adding density to certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5445.0)|
| 1:30:52| depending on whether or not the infrastructure is there, what impact it's going to have on the neighborhood, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5452.0)|
| 1:30:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5458.0)|
| 1:30:59| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5459.0)|
| 1:31:00| The question I had is we're talking about the missing middle in RN areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5460.0)|
| 1:31:08| Do you see a role in adding missing middle to basically the corridors, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5468.0)|
| 1:31:16| the commercial areas of the corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5476.0)|
| 1:31:18| Because that's something that I've always thought maybe we're not as a city in the past giving enough attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5478.0)|
| 1:31:26| because we've got what looks to me like a lot of underused space on the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5486.0)|
| 1:31:33| A lot of it is blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5493.0)|
| 1:31:36| And you have the infrastructure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5496.0)|
| 1:31:38| You have the transportation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5498.0)|
| 1:31:40| You have access to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5500.0)|
| 1:31:44| Customers can, you know, the businesses can use those customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5504.0)|
| 1:31:48| and the residences also have employment opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5508.0)|
| 1:31:53| So since the discussion's all been in RN areas, do you see a place for missing middle on the corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5513.0)|
| 1:32:03| Yes, certainly, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5523.0)|
| 1:32:05| I think there are two aspects to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5525.0)|
| 1:32:08| You know, if you look at the missing middle palette that we've been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5528.0)|
| 1:32:12| there's a small and medium, which we're focusing on as a two-story variety, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5532.0)|
| 1:32:16| And then the large is the three-story variety, which you already have some here in the historic part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5536.0)|
| 1:32:23| So the corridors in between the centers, like what we often recommend to cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5543.0)|
| 1:32:29| ask them, where is your non-residential, you know, your commercial and your retail, where is it most vibrant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5549.0)|
| 1:32:39| And then where it isn't, give those owners the opportunity to decide to do housing in between where it is vibrant in those segments, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5559.0)|
| 1:32:48| And so once you determine where that is, giving those owners that opportunity to do that is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5568.0)|
| 1:32:55| The second thing is then to say, where in those areas should it be this three-story large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5575.0)|
| 1:33:03| or is it really the two-story variety that would work there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5583.0)|
| 1:33:08| or is it that bigger five-story multifamily that, you know, is less defined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5588.0)|
| 1:33:14| So one is finding those areas along corridors, which there are many areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5594.0)|
| 1:33:20| and then secondly, determining which part of the spectrum you're thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5600.0)|
| 1:33:27| I would like for the conversation to be expanded or at least that to be part of the discussion about what we can do with those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5607.0)|
| 1:33:35| And then I guess another comment, I'm really glad to see some kind of middle option between what we've built in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5615.0)|
| 1:33:44| and something between single family and then the multi, you know, huge units that go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5624.0)|
| 1:33:51| And it's been my experience that most neighborhoods will accept reasonable growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5631.0)|
| 1:33:58| It's the big units, multi-units that have the power to really transform the ambience of a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5638.0)|
| 1:34:08| and overwhelm the infrastructure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5648.0)|
| 1:34:14| So this discussion is really very welcome, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5654.0)|
| 1:34:19| and at least the units that I've seen here, the scale of them and the surroundings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5659.0)|
| 1:34:27| where you have more of a, I guess, quality of life, really, to where you have, you can get outside easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5667.0)|
| 1:34:36| You know, it's more consistent with kind of smaller units that people prefer to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5676.0)|
| 1:34:46| And a lot of the people who live in the big, big multi-units, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5686.0)|
| 1:34:53| their eventual goal is to move and move into a single family residence or move into housing that's of a smaller scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5693.0)|
| 1:35:03| And so I'm really glad we're having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5703.0)|
| 1:35:08| And so it sounds a lot more neighborhood friendly than the way we've been doing it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5708.0)|
| 1:35:16| So this is just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5716.0)|
| 1:35:19| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5719.0)|
| 1:35:20| We'll have a lot more discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5720.0)|
| 1:35:22| But those are just my thoughts at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5722.0)|
| 1:35:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5724.0)|
| 1:35:26| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5726.0)|
| 1:35:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5731.0)|
| 1:35:35| Just going back to the plan moving forward, once the targeted area for zoning tweaks is identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5735.0)|
| 1:35:47| I think it's really important that a letter is sent to all impacted property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5747.0)|
| 1:35:54| and that we have a workshop on the proposed changes with a public forum so that we can have input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5754.0)|
| 1:36:04| and an opportunity to be transparent about what's suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5764.0)|
| 1:36:10| show all these beautiful pictures of these non-high-rise buildings that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5770.0)|
| 1:36:18| and hopefully, you know, quell some of the fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5778.0)|
| 1:36:22| and some of the frustration that we've already just recently gone through a major rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5782.0)|
| 1:36:31| And through that process, you know, I feel like a lot of promises were made that this was a big rezoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5791.0)|
| 1:36:38| first in 50 years, and we weren't going to see another one like it anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5798.0)|
| 1:36:44| And to me, this feels like a big change following that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5804.0)|
| 1:36:50| So I'm really encouraging that we notify those who will be directly impacted, bring them into the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5810.0)|
| 1:36:59| and hopefully move this forward with some excitement in the community and less concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5819.0)|
| 1:37:08| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5828.0)|
| 1:37:11| Yeah, so I have two questions at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5831.0)|
| 1:37:16| This one may be, let's see, I don't know, Brian Berry may be able to answer me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5836.0)|
| 1:37:21| So you guys are on notice. Don't jump out of your chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5841.0)|
| 1:37:23| Brian Berry, Mr. Welch, Liz Albertson, you guys might collectively be able to answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5843.0)|
| 1:37:29| We have pocket neighborhood in our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5849.0)|
| 1:37:33| To you guys' knowledge, has that ever been used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5853.0)|
| 1:37:37| All shaking your heads. Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5857.0)|
| 1:37:39| Yeah, implemented into the code way before I was on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5859.0)|
| 1:37:42| That was a pre-recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5862.0)|
| 1:37:44| I don't remember if we moved it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5864.0)|
| 1:37:46| I just remember a lot of conversation way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5866.0)|
| 1:37:48| Okay, no one's ever used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5868.0)|
| 1:37:49| Thanks for answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5869.0)|
| 1:37:51| I think I'm going to go in June and look at one in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5871.0)|
| 1:37:54| All right, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5874.0)|
| 1:37:56| Thank you to one of our constituents out here that taught me about that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5876.0)|
| 1:38:02| So the next question, Ms. Gill, you mentioned updates to the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5882.0)|
| 1:38:08| to provide greater opportunity for missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5888.0)|
| 1:38:11| Tell me what you mean to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5891.0)|
| 1:38:13| Do you mean like modifications to the one-year plan and the sector plan that are presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5893.0)|
| 1:38:19| in the annual one-year plan that would show medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5899.0)|
| 1:38:25| Clarify the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5905.0)|
| 1:38:27| Yeah, so first of all, I do want to differentiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5907.0)|
| 1:38:30| The sector plans are a pretty big undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5910.0)|
| 1:38:32| We're not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5912.0)|
| 1:38:34| You said one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5914.0)|
| 1:38:35| We did say one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5915.0)|
| 1:38:36| So I think this is an opportunity to, again, use some of the language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5916.0)|
| 1:38:41| OptiCoast has identified as really beneficial to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5921.0)|
| 1:38:44| So, again, thinking about whether it's just putting the term missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5924.0)|
| 1:38:48| as a defined term so that people understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5928.0)|
| 1:38:51| We want to make sure that we're setting the stage at a pretty high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5931.0)|
| 1:38:54| And so those one-year plans, and I'll look to maybe Ms. Crockett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5934.0)|
| 1:38:58| or some of the other folks on planning to think about some of the potential examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5938.0)|
| 1:39:03| But we recognize that, again, this is a construct that we don't define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5943.0)|
| 1:39:08| or speak to right now at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5948.0)|
| 1:39:10| It's either single-family or it's multifamily, and we're talking about this space between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5950.0)|
| 1:39:13| And so we want to make sure that that space between is reflected in our plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5953.0)|
| 1:39:19| that then guide you all as a legislative body and our commissioners on planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5959.0)|
| 1:39:24| when they're evaluating potential zoning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5964.0)|
| 1:39:26| So does someone from planning want to speak to any more particular ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5966.0)|
| 1:39:29| that you might identify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5969.0)|
| 1:39:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5972.0)|
| 1:39:33| Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5973.0)|
| 1:39:34| Liz can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5974.0)|
| 1:39:35| She's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5975.0)|
| 1:39:40| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5980.0)|
| 1:39:41| Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5981.0)|
| 1:39:43| I just wanted to point out that in our one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5983.0)|
| 1:39:46| an example of this would be the location criteria that we have for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5986.0)|
| 1:39:51| So you may have heard this brought up during the special use review process sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5991.0)|
| 1:39:56| by constituents concerned about where duplexes would be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5996.0)|
| 1:40:01| within an existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6001.0)|
| 1:40:03| So in our current one-year plan, it says that they must be on a collector street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6003.0)|
| 1:40:09| and there are several other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6009.0)|
| 1:40:13| They must not have gross density exceeding five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6013.0)|
| 1:40:19| So there are several other, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6019.0)|
| 1:40:21| things noted under the location criteria within the one-year plan for duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6021.0)|
| 1:40:26| that could be a barrier to some of the missing middle housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6026.0)|
| 1:40:31| that we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6031.0)|
| 1:40:33| So if I were to go pull a permit to put a duplex from the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6033.0)|
| 1:40:41| right now, how does that get triggered, that it be on whichever arterial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6041.0)|
| 1:40:47| Well, it would only come to planning commission if it was a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6047.0)|
| 1:40:53| if it was listed as that in the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6053.0)|
| 1:40:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6055.0)|
| 1:40:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6056.0)|
| 1:40:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6057.0)|
| 1:40:58| So let's say I own a lot on Oklahoma Avenue, okay, and an empty lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6058.0)|
| 1:41:04| And I came to you guys, it's in an RN2, and I came to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6064.0)|
| 1:41:09| and I said, hey, I need to sign up for my special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6069.0)|
| 1:41:12| I want to put a duplex on this lot, which actually I guess I couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6072.0)|
| 1:41:16| because it's a 5,000-square-foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6076.0)|
| 1:41:18| So let's pretend I have a 10,000-square-foot lot, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6078.0)|
| 1:41:21| We're going to pretend that it's 10,000-square-foot, it's on Oklahoma Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6081.0)|
| 1:41:25| You're familiar with that at where it is, Ms. Albertson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6085.0)|
| 1:41:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6087.0)|
| 1:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6088.0)|
| 1:41:29| It's not a collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6089.0)|
| 1:41:30| It's not a collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6090.0)|
| 1:41:31| So you would say, deny, you can't file a special use and you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6091.0)|
| 1:41:35| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6095.0)|
| 1:41:36| I don't think that staff would be quite so harsh in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6096.0)|
| 1:41:40| Oh, okay, they'd nicely say, sorry, ma'am, this doesn't comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6100.0)|
| 1:41:44| I think that we would acknowledge that there are discrepancies between the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6104.0)|
| 1:41:49| what the plan says, you know, and even if we think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6109.0)|
| 1:41:55| oh, well, it does make sense because it's also within 250 feet of a bus line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6115.0)|
| 1:42:01| you know, I think we would acknowledge that in the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6121.0)|
| 1:42:05| and then also lean to the legislative bodies to sort of make those determinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6125.0)|
| 1:42:10| But then you will also hear from your constituents that will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6130.0)|
| 1:42:13| well, the one-year plan says this, so we should not allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6133.0)|
| 1:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6136.0)|
| 1:42:18| All right, appreciate that clarification on the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6138.0)|
| 1:42:21| I'll be quiet for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6141.0)|
| 1:42:23| Oh, I just went, Mr. Berry walked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6143.0)|
| 1:42:26| I will say the only knowledge of mine since RECODE passed of an ADU in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6146.0)|
| 1:42:31| 4th District was in Holston Hills, and it's on Crestwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6151.0)|
| 1:42:37| I might have gotten that street wrong, but, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6157.0)|
| 1:42:40| One that I'm aware of in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6160.0)|
| 1:42:43| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6163.0)|
| 1:42:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6164.0)|
| 1:42:45| I just want to follow up on Council Member Parker's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6165.0)|
| 1:42:47| I think this is a great opportunity to go to neighborhoods directly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6167.0)|
| 1:42:53| opposed to having a centralized location wherever one comes because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6173.0)|
| 1:42:56| they'll tell you, you know, the lots that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6176.0)|
| 1:42:59| So, I mean, trying to proceed with the least barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6179.0)|
| 1:43:04| go to the neighborhoods and say where do you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6184.0)|
| 1:43:07| and I think that will take care of a lot of low-hanging fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6187.0)|
| 1:43:14| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6194.0)|
| 1:43:19| Well, I just wanted to respond to that suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6199.0)|
| 1:43:22| which I think could be added into the plan, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6202.0)|
| 1:43:27| But some of the projects that have come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6207.0)|
| 1:43:29| the one that came before us and is on our agenda next Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6209.0)|
| 1:43:36| is happening in an area where there's not a neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6216.0)|
| 1:43:39| I think they're looking to form one, but there isn't one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6219.0)|
| 1:43:42| And so I don't want to miss having opportunities for input from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6222.0)|
| 1:43:53| neighbors who aren't included in a neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6233.0)|
| 1:43:56| So I still would push for a workshop with public forum so that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6236.0)|
| 1:44:02| who are interested, just like during the recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6242.0)|
| 1:44:05| would be able to give feedback, lift up concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6245.0)|
| 1:44:09| lift up their support of the plan, but be a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6249.0)|
| 1:44:14| I think that's certainly something we can evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6254.0)|
| 1:44:19| All right, seeing no more lights on, I want to thank Mr. Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6259.0)|
| 1:44:22| Deputy to the Mayor Gill, city and planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6262.0)|
| 1:44:25| who answered some questions for us for a very informative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6265.0)|
| 1:44:29| and good discussion on missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6269.0)|
| 1:44:32| We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6272.0)|
| 1:44:34| And this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6274.0)|
