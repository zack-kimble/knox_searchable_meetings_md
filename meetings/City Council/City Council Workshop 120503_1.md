| 2:39:59| and those kind of things, I'm listening to them and this is important for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9599)|
| 2:40:05| And I also worked for the government at one point, and I have to admit, it wasn't the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| I was there for the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9610)|

| 2:40:28| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9628)|
| 2:40:29| Just so I can see over the podium, Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9629)|
| 2:40:38| president of the Firefighters Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| I want to thank Mayor O'Hara for trying to get this plan up to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| I want to thank all the employees groups for working with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| I want to thank Dr. Lyons for working with us, Mr. Pennington, just kidding, Chief Sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9650)|
| 2:40:57| Chief Roush, Mike Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| You know, we've worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| We, as an association, employees groups, the mayor, we've worked to try and come to a common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9665)|
| 2:41:14| Some of this stuff, like the reverend said, heck, I'm almost confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| I mean, we have some council members, I think it's the correct term, bickering on returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9679)|
| 2:41:26| no tomatoes, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| I don't think we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| I think the public watching us on TV, I think the people out here, we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9691)|
| 2:41:36| We're not going to get there in another meeting, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9696)|
| 2:41:42| You know, I read this opinion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| The guy didn't sign his name, so I'm assuming it was Jack McElroy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| It was pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9710)|
| 2:41:51| But I also read the editorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| We're all supposed to be dead December 21st, according to the editorial I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9714)|
| 2:42:01| But I'm not worried about it, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| Some of the numbers, it's true, the Mayans said so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9726)|
| 2:42:13| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| You know, some of the stuff we talked about, you know, pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9735)|
| 2:42:19| You want to drop it down to $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| I don't know if that goes up with time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9741)|
| 2:42:26| It's kind of like riding a bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9746)|
| 2:42:27| You know, if you're going to feed us, you know, if you're going to give us the money, our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9747)|
| 2:42:32| I mean, we've already shown our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9752)|
| 2:42:34| You know, they said it's not the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9754)|
| 2:42:37| I agree, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| Our defined benefit is most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| You know, it's a gamble to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| Mr. Martin, Mr. Lyons might have been in the meeting a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9762)|
| 2:42:48| It's Russian roulette or it's craps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| You know, the purse strings for the city is hoping I die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| If I die, the city gets more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| Like I said, I'm going to try and outlive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| That's why I'm working out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9782)|
| 2:43:06| You know, some of the numbers I got from the pension board, it's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| Myself and another gentleman who's way smarter than I am, from 1975 to 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9791)|
| 2:43:19| we added up every one of the dollars that the actuary asked the city to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9799)|
| 2:43:26| It was $266,298,696.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9806)|
| 2:43:33| Might be off just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| What the city actually put in was $185,681,394.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9816)|
| 2:43:46| That's underfunded by $90 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| I know what you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| You know, times are up, times are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| What, if I may ask, what percent of the payroll is going this year, do you know, to fund the pension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9835)|
| 2:44:03| Is it about 12%, 13%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| Do you want to come up and average them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| Because what I have, and I quit doing it, but, you know, in 1979 it was 13% payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9849)|
| 2:44:22| In 1981, 1982, it was 12.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| In 77, it was 13.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| Yeah, I mean, it was 11.72 on general government and 21.64 on the uniform body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| And let me say that the recommended contributions, they're shown as a dollar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9874)|
| 2:44:39| but they're also shown as a percentage of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| So if I, if the recommendation is, let's say it's 15% total, that's the recommendation for the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9881)|
| 2:44:49| Upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| So there's a year lag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| And in my experience with the city in the 20 years, the city has always put in the contribution that's been recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9891)|
| 2:44:58| Now, some of the differential may be in that lag in contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| But, you know, I think that's been what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| Well, what I did, and I did like you there for a little bit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| Mr. Fannis, you got 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9910)|
| 2:45:11| No, I added up all the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| We're not going to debate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| What I'm getting at is you guys, and I'm not knocking it, you guys talk more than we do about this and that and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9916)|
| 2:45:23| and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| We come to you, we did, the mayor came to you, trying to put forth a plan to save the taxpayers money, which it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9924)|
| 2:45:32| And we're still not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| We've got one more meeting to go, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9939)|
| 2:45:40| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9941)|
| 2:45:48| David Kitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9948)|
| 2:45:55| David Kitts, 1708 Dancing Light Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9955)|
| 2:46:00| I serve as a supervisor of the Family Crimes Unit of the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9960)|
| 2:46:05| This past Monday, some of you all were in attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| and I was honored by receiving the Civilian of the Year Award from the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9968)|
| 2:46:15| But that might not have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| Because back in 2001, I was given two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| One was to take a full-time position at a university up in Louisville, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9983)|
| 2:46:28| or to come down here and work for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9988)|
| 2:46:32| The difference was I'd be taking a $12,000-a-year cut to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9992)|
| 2:46:38| Now, as a fifth-generation Knoxvillian, I wanted to come home and raise my family so they could be the sixth generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9998)|
| 2:46:46| The difference was that pension, those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10006)|
| 2:46:51| I know you're all in a very tough position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| I love this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| But think about your legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| And part of that legacy is what kind of employees do you want to give to the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10018)|
| 2:47:04| Don't force our citizens to settle for second-class, second-rate employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10024)|
| 2:47:11| I urge you to support that mayor's hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10031)|
| 2:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10037)|
| 2:47:22| Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| Times 815.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10047)|
| 2:47:28| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10048)|
| 2:47:33| Mark Taylor, 724 Hall of Fame Drive, Fraternal Order of Police President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10053)|
| 2:47:37| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| I know I've spoke to a lot of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| I appreciate all the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| A couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| I'd say you probably about give half the command staff of the police department a stroke or an aneurysm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10066)|
| 2:47:52| We're talking about significantly increasing the pay for a new police officer to that of a captain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10072)|
| 2:48:00| or a captain in the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| The thing is, and this is an excellent point that I'll point out to you, these jobs aren't like other jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10082)|
| 2:48:11| They require morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| They require discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| They require teamwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10095)|
| 2:48:16| And without that, not only do the officers out there suffer and accept more risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10096)|
| 2:48:22| because we're doing more with less all the time, and that's been the trend for a long time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10102)|
| 2:48:27| We have less police officers than we did when I came here, less allotted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| and we have a lot more ground, a lot more calls, and a lot more responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10111)|
| 2:48:36| And we're handling those in a lot better ways than we were 15, 16 years ago, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| and exponentially more 20 or 30 years before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10121)|
| 2:48:46| When you start adjusting around and you start creating some different casts in organizations, the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10126)|
| 2:48:54| police work, fire work, you get at that morale and that discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10134)|
| 2:48:59| It becomes a hard thing to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| And that, I would say, could create a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10142)|
| 2:49:07| And I don't know any way to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| I mean, that portion of it, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10149)|
| 2:49:14| The other thing is we talked about the percentile, the 50th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| There's no way to compensate that person fairly if you substantially change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10159)|
| 2:49:25| or if you go completely away from the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10165)|
| 2:49:28| You can't take someone's pay that's been there a year and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10168)|
| 2:49:33| and accelerate it to the 20-year veteran's pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| You just, I mean, think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| How do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| I appreciate all the citizens that came to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| I appreciate your attention to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| I know that was something the council was looking for, input from the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| And I'm glad to finally see that some citizens showed up tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| and had the opportunity to do that and speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10192)|
| 2:49:56| I appreciate all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10196)|
| 2:49:57| I appreciate all the employees that have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10197)|

| 2:50:07| I see Ronnie Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10207)|
| 2:50:08| You haven't signed up, but I'm going to assume you want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10208)|
| 2:50:17| We'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| Can you give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10221)|
| 2:50:22| It's 818.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10222)|
| 2:50:23| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| Yeah, I'm sorry I was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10225)|
| 2:50:26| Ronnie Collins, 4606 Washington Park, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10226)|
| 2:50:33| I was asked to come and speak to in support of the mayor's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10233)|
| 2:50:40| I know when I go to work in the mornings and I see going down Washington Park and Millartown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10240)|
| 2:50:48| and I see my neighbors that are afraid to get in a ditch and trim their yards, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10248)|
| 2:50:54| they'll trim down to the ditch line and then they'll let it grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10254)|
| 2:50:58| and it will be a foot or two tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| If that, and I may be old school, but whatever, they're called city services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10260)|
| 2:51:07| whatever the guy on the tractor that comes by every week or two and mows those down, they never get cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10267)|
| 2:51:13| They just keep growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| The guys that are out there picking up the trash all the time that are thrown out by a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10276)|
| 2:51:25| Most of you have been to our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| I've seen Officer Minner that comes to our meetings and how well he presents himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10288)|
| 2:51:34| and how our people really like to have him show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10294)|
| 2:51:42| I almost said Lieutenant Woolridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| I keep forgetting he's been promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| He had a lot to do with keeping that going in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10307)|
| 2:51:51| and our people are always, well, you know, glad to hear what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10311)|
| 2:51:59| and be able to present him with problems that they see in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10319)|
| 2:52:05| And we don't want to lose people like him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| I also have never met the man, but Officer Olson, that was shot two blocks from my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10329)|
| 2:52:19| because he was doing his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10339)|
| 2:52:22| And everything I've heard from other officers about him, I know he's the kind of person we want in our streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10342)|
| 2:52:32| and the kind of recruited people we want to keep coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10352)|
| 2:52:37| And I feel that the mayor's plan will help do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| We want to keep these people coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10362)|
| 2:52:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10365)|
| 2:52:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10366)|
| 2:52:47| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=10369)|
