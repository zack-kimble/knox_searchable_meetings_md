| 0:07:45| I guess my question is then, were you associated with that business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| In no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| And it's been closed for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| To our knowledge, I think January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| Since the passing of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| So, now, I don't believe we have any of the documentation that we require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| Do you all want to discuss your business plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| It's going to be more focused for desserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| That's what Francisimos means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| So, it's going to be, like, a lot of cakes and pastries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| And then we're going to have, like, wine and jazz music, just like the original 4620.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| And your plan is to, are you renovating the space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| Have you already leased the space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Yes, we leased it from Hallrob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| From Hallrob to the owners of the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| And we have the sales tax, the Tennessee sales tax here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| So, when had you planned to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| Whenever we got approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Well, we have a little problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| You've got a little homework to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| And I guess my question is, why have you not accomplished any of these inspections or the task training or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=529)|
| 0:08:58| We just recently, the signing of the lease got pushed back, and we just recently signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Yeah, we thought we had to get this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| So, we haven't been able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| We just recently got the lease, so we haven't been able to schedule those appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| So, I think maybe since I'm the councilman who represents the district that you'll be operating in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| I think that I would suggest that you come back in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| And I think that won't be a problem since you so recently made these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| I'm prepared to make a motion, but if you all would rather speak prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| Councilman Frost and Councilman Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| On the records check, you all indicated that you hadn't had any misdemeanors or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| but what the police department shows is a litany of misdemeanor issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=581)|
| 0:09:49| and particularly concerning are a few fire code violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| Where did those occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Hannah's in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| I mean, there's one, looks like about four or five different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| I only remember two, and they got dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| They got dismissed, and there was no problem with any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Okay, well, it just says guilty, paid fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| What year was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| February 28th, 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| October 30th, 2004, there were one, two, three, four fire code violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=629)|
| 0:10:39| Then one in February 24th, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| One on February 4th of 2004, two in the same month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| And then one in 2001 for days and hours of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| And they all say guilty, paid fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| I didn't know I was ever charged with any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| I just left the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Councilman Becker, would you like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Well, I guess I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| There actually is a form you all filled out where it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| and this is what Councilman Frost was asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| where it specifically asks if you've been convicted of any misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| And you both checked no, and you both actually have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| If Ms. Pelos' motion to postpone passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| I'd actually recommend that you just amend this to bring it up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| I didn't know those were misdemeanor charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| When do you plan on opening, just as soon as you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| When do you think you could open if you got your permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| Probably September 1st, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| I have another question I feel that I'm obligated to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| I believe Mr. Carleo, which is Mr. Carleo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| I don't know if that's how I should pronounce your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| But I noticed that you indicated you had surrendered a permit back in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| Yeah, I had like a pizza business on a strip where I had to shut it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| and I just surrendered a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| And you just surrendered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Are any of these charges involving that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| No, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| No, no, that was on a strip a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| You voluntarily surrendered your beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Because you closed the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| I just wanted to clear that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Then I will continue with my motion to postpone a decision on this until the August beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=751)|
| 0:12:40| which will be the 4th, I guess the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| I'm not sure if it's the 4th, 3rd, Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| It's in August at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=767)|

| 0:16:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Chair, we need a motion to request this be postponed to the August beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Just talk a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| I have a question on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| Is anyone looking at this proximity of it's too close for on-premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| Has that been discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=986)|

| 0:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Is it too close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Is that part of the decision to withhold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| We suspect they're probably applying for a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| I suspect you might be suspecting correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| All those in favor of the motion to postpone, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Those opposed have likewise right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Now, we're to the Ms. Martin that was previously presented for beer board review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1013)|
| 0:17:03| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| We have for you tonight Daytona Knights, who you have given one extension to, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| they are here to discuss another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| Please come down, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Give us your name and address and the reason for your request for your extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| Brantley Woods, 1723 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| It's Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| The reason I'm asking for an extension, we've had a problem with the plumbing, with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| we had on the plans versus what the plaza already had pre-existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| We were in a battle with the plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| We finally got through this mess this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| It's just kind of been a big hurdle to deal with with them, but that's all I'm asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| for is an extension so the plumber can actually get started in there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| We've already been approved through plans and reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Now we're just trying to get the work done so we can get our final inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| Any discussion, questions, motions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| I mean, I'd be, I guess I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| How long do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Is it 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Will that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| That would be more than enough if you ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Would you prefer it be 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| No, I would take the 60 just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| I'll move a 60-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| How do we make this motion a 60-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1109)|

| 0:18:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Write it up right, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| September beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| It's been a motion to grant extension to the September beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| All those in favor signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1125)|

| 0:18:47| You have an extension to the September beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| See, Ms. Davis, you know that date, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Yes, Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| They don't actually have to come back before you if they get their work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| They've been approved and they bring in the documentation that everything's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| We're going to release that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1140)|

| 0:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| We're going to release that permit to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Make sure you know the date in case you don't have everything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| But if you do, you don't have to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Yes, Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Next, we have requests from the Dogwood Arts Festival to add an event to their annual special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| And we'll hear from the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| My name is Robin Nelson, address 106 West, Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| You have the request before us, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| We'd like a one-night extension to August 9th of our previously issued beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| This allows the festival to serve a public beer concession at a concert that is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| given to the community from a convention group that is in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| We did this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| It gives us a small stream of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| We'd like to be able to do that again this year, particularly since we were rained out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| last April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Any questions, comments, or motions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Yes, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| I guess just one, and I wish Charles was here for this question, but maybe some of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| great legal minds around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Can we extend one-day special event permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| I mean, I assume since they're asking for it, this is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Do we know that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| They're asking for a year-long special beer permit, so they're adding an event to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| annual permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Well, you know, I'm just going to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| I think this comment was made maybe by me, maybe someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| Initially, when we granted this year-long permit, I could just see that we were just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| going to be coming back and coming back and whatever, and I just really am not comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| I don't do that for everybody, and I would just like to see if you all know that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| going to have another event to include it on the front end when you request the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| Since you did this last year, I have a feeling you knew that it was coming up again this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| We're big supporters of the festival, don't get me wrong, but I just think it puts us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| in a position of maybe being asked to do things that we may not be comfortable with at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Well, I understand your concern, and even though we did do this last year, since this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| project and proposal was brought to us from another entity at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Conference Services, I did not have an indication that, in fact, we would be asked to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| This is a privilege for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| It's something that really helps the festival, and we do hope for your support on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| And it helps us when you give us that full explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Is there a motion from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1316)|

| 0:22:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| In the last item, we have a request from Crowne Plaza for a special one-day permit, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| order for them to meet the requirements of their event date, they may need a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| meeting since you haven't seen their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| So we have a representative here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Ken Knight, 845 Bennett Place, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| We were delayed getting the paperwork completed because not until actually this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| did we get the contract signed by the group that's asking us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| We're actually catering a dinner as well as providing some beer for the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| And because we just got the application today, we weren't able to complete our paperwork until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| So your request is that we have a special beer board meeting before our July 31, 2007 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| And this is something that wouldn't be covered under your existing beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| The event is in Market Square, so our permit just covers the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| And you're catering the event, so you need a beer permit, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| I'll move to have a special call beer board meeting at 655 on July 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| All those in favor signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Those opposed have it likewise right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| We will see you on July 31 at 655.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Anything else, Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Unfortunately, the beer board, we are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Now we go to our administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| And let me find my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1419)|
| 0:23:50| Pizza Hut, 2405 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1430)|
| 0:24:01| James Bluford, 2405 Chapman Highway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Mr. Council, the fine has been paid and there is a remedial plan submitted for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| The chair would entertain any questions for the representative from Pizza Hut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1452)|
| 0:24:25| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| I mean, they both got carded, yet they didn't pick up on the age of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| The manager in charge actually carded the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| And she was in a bad situation where her server didn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| So she was having to take care of the dining customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| And she was really stressed out, overworked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| When she read the ID, she thought it said 12-20-86, or 1-20-86.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| And it actually said 12-20-86.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| She just misread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| In addition to the actions on the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| I'm currently working with our computer programmers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| any time a beer is rang in by a server that it requires a manager override to double check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| We currently have a system in place where they write it down and give it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1517)|
| 0:25:25| Or bring the general manager the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| But we're going to also get it integrated with the computer system in all the stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| Not just this one, but all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Well, just related to that, the way you do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| it says here that the server will write down the birth date and then show it to a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| You're saying what you actually do is show the ID to the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| So you've had two sets of eyes looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| And also, on the computerized menu, when they try to key it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| it will require a manager to scan their fingerprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Councilman Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Well, this is in the district I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| so certainly any infraction like this in the city is a concern to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| And this especially would be to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| But there's a significant space of time between these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| And so I think that's something that has to be taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| And we also have changed general managers at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| There actually is a significant time between them, isn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| They barely made the two within a year, didn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Anything else, Councilman Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| Anything further from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| Seeing no motion, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| we thank you for coming down and please do better in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| We certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Stephanos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| As she comes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| note for council the $500 fine has been paid and a remedial plan has been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Please give us your name and address, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Sandra Hobbs, 1937 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Give us a brief overview of what happened, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| The cadet was carded and it was just looked at incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| He looked at the birth date wrong and served her a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| What happened the other time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| The cadet came back in from the dining room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| and there had been several other females that he had carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| He just thought that she was one of the ones he had already carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| And he did not card her when she came back in from the dining room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| He did not come up directly to the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Since then, we have changed policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Everyone is carded, regardless of age, whether or not they have been in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| or have been already carded once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| We card every single time a beer goes across the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| Seeing no light from council, ma'am, we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| I'm trying to focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| You notice that both this one and the other one that's on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| for the administrative hearings, the violations were the same days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| and during the same stings in both cases, and they're both very close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| And just for sake of argument in terms of consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| I believe it was the tap room when they had two violations that were close together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| and we chose to send them on to suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| This board did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| So I think we ought to think about consistency here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1716)|
| 0:28:50| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| I think with the tap room, they didn't card on either of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| And it's always been my policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| and I think I actually made the motion to send them to suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| is if you haven't carded, something's more serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| If both these were, you know, not carded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I would be making a motion to send a suspension and revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| But I don't feel inconsistent by saying if you're carding and misreading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| that's different than if you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| Because carding and misreading is trying and misreading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| Not carding seems to me a much more significant problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| I just want to make sure that we addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Councilwoman Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| My recollection on the other establishment that you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| was that there were some other issues that really concerned me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| that would have been some violations of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| I think there were some violations about overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| and some other issues, if I'm remembering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| It's been some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| And I tend to agree with Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| I was rather pleased to see the plan that you had put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| and whether that's going to solve all the problems remains to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| But I was glad to see that you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| We also have instituted a policy, something of a pizza suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| We are now actually to slow the process down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| We are having them write down the birth date on a sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| so that they actually have to physically write it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| so it makes the person slow down so that they're just not glancing at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| They have to write it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| You may want to consider amending your plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| and giving the office an amended copy of that plan to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| It is in the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Oh, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Yes, ma'am, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Next we have Moe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| Council will note their fine has been paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| and there's also a remedial plan, a written remedial plan submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| My name is James Sills, 1800 Cumberland Avenue, Laxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| Tell us very quickly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| From my understanding, the manager –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| You can speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| From my understanding, the manager that was on duty misread the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| Basically what happened after that, he was terminated on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| The general manager, we put things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| He didn't want to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| He was terminated on the spot as well shortly after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| We have moved up our district manager from Atlanta, Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| to oversee our alcohol program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| We put steps in place like the beer of this age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| like you see at the gas stations with cigarettes, et cetera, beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| We also have a program that we feel will be very strong for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| It's called TIPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| If you're familiar with the restaurant business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| it's what we call in our business the leader of certifying people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| showing that we really care about what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| and we're serious about the problem that's existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| I'm very embarrassed by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I've been doing this a very long time, and I've never had this happen to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| in any of the restaurants I've been a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Regardless, it doesn't make it right what this individual did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| but I can guarantee you he will never work for us again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| and I hope Knoxville would stop him from being able to sell a drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| anywhere for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| And did I hear you correctly that both individuals involved have been terminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Any – Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Well, I guess two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| According to what we've got, it was the same individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Yes, sir, a same store manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| And so he, in October of 2006, he sold to an underage cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1932)|
| 0:32:20| He misread the ID as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| According to this one, he didn't even ask for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| And then he wasn't terminated until the next time he did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| He was suspended and, you know, not terminated but without pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| and, you know, we addressed the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| And we went through Moe's Corporate, which we have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| and they gave us the tools to make sure that we complied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| with our universal franchise agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| which is, you know, something that we have to go along with too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| And they've also been pleased with us outsourcing tips as our main focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| to get everybody certified that is of age to sell alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| and it's something that we're willing to do if it's all right with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| The people that we've had that are running the store have been through the task classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| I'm one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Matt back there is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| He came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| He's the guy that's operating the store now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| And this is something that I never want to see happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| and I'm sure you don't want to see us again either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| Let me just continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| The written policy it has here says all employees will be trained to consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| card all customers who look under the age of 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| It's a real concern to me because I think it's hard to tell by looking at somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| what age they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| I've been a big proponent of we're going to card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| And I know there are plenty of people who are gray-headed that are mad about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| But at some level, personally, I don't want to trust saying to somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| it's your job to decide how old this person is before you're asking for an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| Have you looked at a policy that says we're going to card everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| That's a very fair question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| and I think that's something we need to look at is card everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| because not only is it fair, it keeps consistency like you guys are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| Like I said, I'm not very familiar with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I have never been through this, so I'm not sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I'm not going to lie to you or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| but what I'm saying is I'm open for suggestions to be able to be a better citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| I don't want to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| And we're going to hire the right people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| With our managing, we're doing testing and stuff like that for abuses such as alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| It's called an assessment test as well, but that has nothing to do with this bust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| But it's something that we're looking to stay out of the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| We want to do the right thing and be on the news for the right reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| and this is not something I'm overly thrilled with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Anything further from Kathleen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| I was just going to say, I just couldn't encourage you any stronger to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| I think it takes the responsibility off your shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| It takes the responsibility off your servers, who at times are, I imagine, under a little bit of stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| and young folks that don't always make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| And, I mean, I know you couldn't tell if I'm over 40 or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| So, you know, think what a responsibility you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Now, I almost doubled that 40, but, I mean, seriously, in today's world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| it is a very difficult thing to judge age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| And I think when you're asking, you know, just young folks that need a job to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| it really puts them in an unfair position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| So I recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| It is happening all over the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| It is happening all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| And you won't be the only one, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| I'm definitely for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| I apologize once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Seeing no further lights from council, thank you, Sarah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| Let's do better next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Any further business before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| The chair would entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070717?start=2153)|
