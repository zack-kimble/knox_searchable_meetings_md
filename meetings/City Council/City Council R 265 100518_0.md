| 0:01:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=60)|

| 0:01:14| Any motions dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| I would like to recommend that we move items 12C, D, and E to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| 12C, D, and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| These are the 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Mr. Swanson, is that a proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| And now I'll need a motion to adopt the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| And we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Anything else dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Mr. DellaVote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| I just wanted to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| I think I now know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| But 12B is the capital improvement plan that has both the six-year looking out plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| and the one-year fiscal budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| I'm trying to understand if that has to be acted on before we act on engineering's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=137)|
| 0:02:25| for a contract to repave streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| And I think my understanding is that that's under the 210 budget, which is already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| But I wasn't sure if we were getting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| No, you're correct about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| The night's contract is on the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| The capital improvement plan and the budget start July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Anything else on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| If not, we will move into Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| Mayor Haslam will be late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| That's why he is not sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| The mayor has two items, and I will just read these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| First, the Cumberland Avenue streetscape plan moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| After considering all the alternatives and hearing from the public and affected property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| the City announced yesterday that we are moving forward with a plan to develop a three-lane street section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| including two through lanes, a center turn lane for left-turn movements, and wider sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=202)|
| 0:03:29| The detailed design phase should be completed within 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| There will be other opportunities for public comment during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| Second announcement is on the public discussion of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| The second in a series of public conversations about the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| will be held from 6 p.m. until 7 p.m. on Wednesday, May 19th, that's tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| at the counselor family YMCA 616 Jessamine Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| The first conversation on supportive services was well attended, quite productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| Eight of the nine council members were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| and Ms. Palmer was not able to come because she was recovering from surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| At tomorrow night's meeting, we'll be discussing the cost of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| Bill Lyons and John Lawler will present for the first half of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| The second half of the meeting will be reserved for questions and conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| related to the subject of costs associated with permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| Reports of members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| I have two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| First of all, the school year is coming to a quick end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| I'm getting a number of calls from parents who are concerned that speeding on neighborhood streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| needs to really take a downturn as school is out so that kids who might not be as observant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| are safe as they cross the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| So I would just ask everyone to really keep an eye on the speed limit, keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| The second thing is that at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| we considered an electronic price change sign legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=307)|
| 0:05:15| and at that time I volunteered along with Councilman Grieve to come up with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| so that we could kind of get our collective heads as a council together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| Tomorrow, in an email, you will receive something called a force field analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| and this is a technique or a tool that helps us really focus on the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| and look at the forces for changing and the forces to not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| And I would ask that when you complete those that you submit them to Ms. Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| and she will keep them safe because Mr. Swanson has informed me that we have to have a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| and not a deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| So Ms. Mitchell will keep those together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| and then we'll talk about them at our earliest public convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| I'll try to be real clear in the directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Yes, I just wanted to report that the Alice Bell Spring Hill community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| had its first community day celebration on Saturday at the New Harvest Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| out towards the Target on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| And it was a nice event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| They had community groups, information booths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| They had services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| They had play areas for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| The police and fire and first aid helped out and, you know, gave information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| They had nice entertainment, some food, and it was a good community event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| and it was well attended, and I want to congratulate them for putting that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| Yes, I'd like to announce on June the 5th, that's on a Saturday morning at 1030 District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| we will be having a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| It will be held at Knoxville College in the Student Center in the Presidential Dining Room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| and there will be more information forthcoming on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Vice Mayor Becker has a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| If you all can pass these around real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| One, I want to remind everybody, next Thursday, the 27th of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| Council will be having a workshop at 5 o'clock on development tools that I believe will be in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| An agenda we'll get out to everybody on Council tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| Second thing, the main thing I want to go over is legislative budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| which will be Tuesday, May 7th, and Tuesday, June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| And I want to go over this to sort of get what I'm hoping is the structure we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| the structure I think we've used for the last couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| I've handed out the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| What we'll be doing during the day Tuesday is hearing from departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| We'll hear from finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| We'll hear actually from the mayor and the administration first about an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| There will be time in there for questions as well as for learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| so there will be a lot of back and forth during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Tuesday evening is the public forum, which is a chance for the public to come and talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| And then the important part, and what I want to stress to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| and I think, Mr. Pavlis, this is new since you were on Council, is the session on June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| It's listed at 1045, the last item, city council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| This is the time where we try and talk about any changes we want to make to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| And we're not, as Mr. Swanson reminds us, we're not allowed to vote there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| We can take and do take straw polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| If people want to suggest differences, we can talk about it, mull it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| do a straw poll to decide if it's worth moving forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| Official changes will be made the evening of June 1st when the budget comes up for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| We do the discussion that day as a chance to have a little more time to go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| We're not pressed by all the other items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| And I would point out to folks that we can postpone one more time if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| The budget needs to be adopted by June 15th at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| Our next meeting will actually be June 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| So if there is more discussion that needs to happen on June 1st, we can pick that up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| But I wanted to go over that with everybody now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| Any quick questions people have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| I had one question on that Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Will there be a place for if the public wants to ask some questions on that Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| I don't see anything down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| That's the Tuesday on the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| The public hearing is set at 5 o'clock on Tuesday the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| Tuesday, June 1st, we don't traditionally have room for the public to comment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| It's a council prerogative to listen to anybody we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| And then, again, we'll have the time at the meeting that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Mr. Bailey, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| When did you say there would be time to discuss the budget and have straw polls and so on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| That's Tuesday, June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| It's set right now at 1045 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| It's at the end of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| It's what we've done for the last several years, all the hearings, the learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| and then a discussion time at the end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| On the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| On the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| This is not the budget, but the first item you spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| and that was the developmental tools workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| I hope that Mr. Donaldson or someone from MPC will be there to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| or answer questions about what methods we have of controlling development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| as well as promoting development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| and I hope that we'll have someone beyond just the economic team there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| I think now Mr. Donaldson and I had a conversation today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| that he apparently was hoping to take that day off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| and he and I will have a discussion tomorrow figuring out how to settle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| Would you like some of that discussion about how zoning tools can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| to control development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Yeah, it's certainly part of the package that we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| and I think it would be helpful to have someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| even if just someone to ask questions if you're not there, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| someone from your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Anything else under reports of counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| If not, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| 8A is a resolution appointing City Council Member Brenda Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| to serve as an ex officio member of the Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| of the Knoxville Zoological Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Requested by Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Moved to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| I'll take that as a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| 9A is an ordinance approving the request of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| for a one-year plan amendment from central business to public parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| and refuges for property located on the northwest side of Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| northeast of 11th Street, the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| 9B is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| of Cumberland Avenue, northeast of 11th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| from C2 Central Business District to C2 Central Business District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| slash D1 Downtown Design Overlay District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| City of Knoxville Applicant, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Mr. DellaVolpe, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| I'm still trying to get my arms around the Design Overlay District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| in the sense of if they approve an action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| does it still require our review or oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| or is that the end of it when they take an action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| May I ask who they is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| The Design Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| The board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Yes, the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| The board has the authority to grant a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| within the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| which basically says that the project meets the guidelines to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| That's the end of the zoning review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| It would then move on to permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| So there is no loop through city council other than through an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| An appeal would first go from an appeal of the board's decision would first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| go to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| and then that could then in turn be appealed to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| But during the ordinary course it simply goes to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| and they measure the proposed activity against the guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| And only an appeal brings it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| I'd like to call on Ms. Wallace who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| and she I think has some additional information that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| I just wanted to add a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| Ann Wallace with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| This property is zoned as a public park and is owned by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| so the recommendations that are made by the board would then the certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| of appropriateness would solely be a letter of recommendation to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| with regards to that public piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| So there would be an opportunity for additional consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| and similar to what Mark suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| if there was a rezoning or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| it would come to city council after the board's had a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| Does that clarify things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| It comes automatically or it comes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| The way that the design review process is set up for private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| or non-publicly owned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| there's one track for public projects or public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| There's an additional track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| which is basically that the board reviews a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| and makes a statement of whether or not it meets the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| and they would forward that letter on to city council and the mayor as a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| So for public projects, we do get to have some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| 9C is in ordinance, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| In the Knoxville City Code, Appendix B, Zoning Regulations, Article 5, Section 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| Yard, Building Setback, and Open Space Exceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| allowing awnings to extend over public property in all zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=908)|

| 0:17:19| In reading through this information, I guess I was a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| There seemed to be some community concern about the density of the project going to potentially 24 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1043)|
| 0:17:32| and the height of the buildings going several stories on a promontory-type point that might stand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| We're not on that one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1060)|

| 0:18:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Mr. De La Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Now the question that I started to ask but was out of sequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Mr. Donaldson, if you would tell us, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| there was some community concern about both the density of 24 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| and the height of some of the buildings that might, because they were several stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| might well stick out and be different than the surrounding area uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| Could you tell me how MPC resolved that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| Well, we have to start with a prior application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| which was for a development plan approval within the RP1 zone several months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| where the development plan was proposed with a tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1144)|
| 0:19:13| and that plan was approved by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| but one of the conditions of the approval was to eliminate what shows up as a dotted line on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1157)|
| 0:19:26| because the distribution of the density of the proposed development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| although it was well below the maximum number of units allowed in both of these districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1172)|
| 0:19:41| exceeded the number of units in the 24 unit per acre segment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| and was far below it in the up to 14 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| The end compromise was to just reclassify the whole area as 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| and then that difference, that went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| The project then is capped at 19 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| The development plan had already been approved and had been subject to review by the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| It was, in fact, several stories shorter than a previously approved development plan for the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1215)|
| 0:20:24| Right, but the proposal here is for a density of 24 units per acre, and you're talking about 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| I'm trying to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| I read the paperwork, and I wasn't 100% sure how it was resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| other than they grouped those two pieces as one, and we're going to talk about one density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and there seemed to be some comparison in time between the present-time proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| and something that had been proposed years ago when the golf course was sort of decommissioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| and turned into residential, and I wasn't 100% sure how it came out and how you got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| Well, we got there by approving a development plan for a total number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| far less than what is allowed under the current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| subject to the condition that they remove that line to make the differentiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| between the north half of the parcel and the south half of the parcel go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| The 19 units per acre reflects the actual number of units approved in the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| so that the proposed development plan, which is the site plan, the actual plan that's proposed to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1282)|
| 0:21:31| did not meet the differentiation of the current zoning but will meet the 19 units per acre, which is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Then I guess my question should be to counsel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| It looks like the first warehouse clause talked about changing from the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| RP1, 6 to 14, and RP1 to 24, and making it all, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1309)|
| 0:21:57| RP1 residential at a density of 24 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| There seems to be an error in the language of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| and maybe that's corrected in Section 1 at the actual adoption clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| but would you look that over and make sure we're consistent with the explanation we were just given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| That may have come from the application, which did apply to have it made 24 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| It may just slip through the process somehow, but I was reading that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| and I got confused about where we ended up with the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| The recommendation from the Planning Commission is 19 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| So we should strike through that and make that 19 on Page 1 in the first warehouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| I'm looking at this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Well, number one, the warehouses don't really matter anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| When you get over to the operative section, it says 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| It also says in the caption 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| But they did ask for 24, so it's really not completely inaccurate to say that they asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| It's describing their request as opposed to the final action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| That's what their application was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| That's what the first warehouse deals with, filing the application asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Well, that's what caused my confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| If that's the appropriate form, then I'm fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1390)|

| 0:29:37| It's just to make sure that we don't have to come back and extend it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| But it doesn't have a price tag to it, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Quite frankly, we're going to be done with the project before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| but we just wanted to make sure that there's plenty of time for any of the project ending work that the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| have to do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to approve change order number two to contract number C10072| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| with Southern Constructors, Inc. for additional services associated with the Blount Avenue reconstruction project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| in an amount not to exceed $41,490.98 for a new contract price of $1,702,582.77| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1816)|
| 0:30:27| and to increase the contract time by 21 days for a new completion date of August 5, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| I move to amend the pay raise and ordinance to amend Sections 2-450, 458, and 459 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| to adjust the City of Knoxville's classification and compensation plans for general government employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| and uniformed members of the police and fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Mr. Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Yes, I want to understand the relationship of this ordinance to the discussions that have been going around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| in the community about pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| We were at your budget presentation, and I was thrilled to hear you say that we're not laying off any people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| and that's a wonderful thing in hard economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| These reclassifications and additions of job classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| they are simply filling out sort of our dance card of positions that might have compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| as opposed to dealing with pay raises themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| I'll let Ms. Hatfield speak directly to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Is the question specifically about the new job classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| I guess there's two parts because there's the new job classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| and then there's a table in the back with a bunch of step raises and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Start with the classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| The new job classes, every July we check in with each department to see if they have any needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| with regard to their classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Some will retitle jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| You see some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| All of the new classes that we're creating right now are actually to move people who are current city employees into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| basically where there's a need that their current classification description does not fit the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| So sometime during the year, the department will be moving current employees into those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| So it's not actually an increase in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| It's just to make sure people are properly classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| The second part is, while we're not laying off people, we are giving some pay increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| One is a two and a half percent, more or less, across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| When you list these job titles, are they at the new rates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| In other words, are they listed with the increase in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Or what is the purpose of that listing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| The tables that you see, the class comp plan always appears in the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| And every July, any adjustments that are made to that plan will come to you in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| So the tables that you see in the code incorporate the changes that were recommended by Mercer in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| and basically the portion of that that we were able to fund this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| So what you see in those tables are the changes to the structure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| That's just to the actual pay grades and to the step structure for police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| Any changes that take place to the individuals don't actually have anything to do with those tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| That's just the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Those are in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Is that the starting level or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Yeah, that's what, for general government, what you see is a minimum pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| and that's the starting pay for a new employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| The midpoint pay is sort of that market rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| and then the maximum is actually where the employee is capped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| And then for police and fire, you actually see a step structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| So each employee in police and fire sits on a step relative to their years in that job class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| And do I understand that under the structure as being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| anyone below the midcap is at least going to get the Mercer pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Under the Mercer implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| the person that is below the midpoint will advance a step in the uniform classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| and will advance basically one additional year of credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| which is basically one-tenth of the difference between the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| and the midpoint for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| I guess this question is for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| How does this relate to the budget process that we're reviewing downstream from this next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| The steps process is kind of a process that happens within the whole level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| and classifications of each different job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| What we did was kind of a separate thing of the two-and-a-half percent pay raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| which by ordinance happens in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| And then number two, the second-and-a-half step of the Mercer plan to adjust pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| So you kind of have three different things going on, the two-and-a-half percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| the Mercer plan, and the step adjustment, which happen on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Did I say that right, Vicki?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| I was just trying to get my arms around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| It is a little confusing when you're not used to a system like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| The steps piece is particularly confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Item 12B is an ordinance to approve and adopt the Fiscal Year 2011-2016 Knoxville Capital Improvement Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| including the FY2011 Capital Improvement Budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Before you got here, I think the Vice Mayor clarified it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| but I understand we are approving this subject to, in essence, our review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| and the budget hearings we'll be holding before second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Every year you specifically approve that year's plan of what goes into the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| and then you have an overall capital plan, which contains multi-year somewhat budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| but also there are more projections, I guess would be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| A plan going out six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| The first year in the column is acting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| You have the plan, and then what you will vote on June 1st will be the reality part of that plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| The rest of it is what we're looking downstream as we plan our future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| and where we're trying to put our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| That takes us to public forum, and the first is Robert Zivie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| I might be Zivie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Robert Zivie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Hey, Robert, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I'm Robert Allen Zivie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| I live at 2323 Wilson Road, Millwood Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| I have a question especially for you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| I was told specifically that you told the people that fix the road on Merchants Road to Pleasant Ridge to stop at a certain stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2187)|
| 0:36:42| but that's very unsafe, what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| I'd like to get an adjournment to stop the road to be open May 31st because where we live is very unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2209)|
| 0:37:02| I talked to Brenda Palmer about this tonight, and specifically right up here is fixed, but right here to here is very unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2222)|
| 0:37:19| We ride the city bus, and when it rains, we have to wait in a sewage dish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2239)|
| 0:37:28| We need you police and city council, please, fix the problem and get the construction all the way to Pleasant Ridge to I-640, not just part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2248)|
| 0:37:51| I wonder why, Mill, you have it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| Can you please explain to me that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| Steve, do you know the road project he's referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| He's referring to the Pleasant Ridge Road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| and there's been a significant amount of overhead utility delays that Ms. Palmer and I talked about today, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2288)|
| 0:38:18| I think what he is, the schedule calls for the road to be opened back up two-way to I think it's Sisk Road by a date relatively soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2298)|
| 0:38:29| He's requesting that the roadway be opened up all the way to I-640 two lanes sooner than it's in the contractor's schedule to have that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2309)|
| 0:38:41| Because when we wait for the bus, it's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| If, say that's the dish right here, and then when it rains real bad, you can fall down and trip and really get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2327)|
| 0:38:56| So please, get the police, make the whole system, make the whole road, please, safe for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2336)|
| 0:39:07| Sidewalk, we need especially, your bridge is coming apart on Pleasant Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2347)|
| 0:39:16| Brenda Palmer saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| I know she had an operation, she told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2360)|
| 0:39:28| I'll show you what I mean, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2371)|
| 0:40:01| They go like 60 to 70 miles an hour. We need more protection with the police. I talked to chief police earlier, and I do have speech trouble, so if you don't understand me, ask me please, I would say. I tell that to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2401)|
| 0:40:23| So, um, would you please, mayor, tell the, the, the Interzoneal department to go ahead and give them permission to fix the rest of Pledge of Allegiance so we can be safe. And, um, the bus company went out, put the bus stop back where it was until there is, um, sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2423)|
| 0:40:50| When they had an accident months ago, um, then the city bus company took the sign down, and then they came where we lived, um, and make all these excuses why they could not do that or why they were not willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2450)|
| 0:41:12| The bus drivers were stopping at the house, but over here was the bus stop, um, because that, that was a ditch too, and it was, it was more safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2472)|
| 0:41:28| Um, so, would you, Mayor Hassel, please tell them to extend and please fix all Pledge of Allegiance, um, with sidewalks and make it safe for us to ride the bus, um, and be on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2488)|
| 0:41:53| I know you want it for governor. Um, your dad, my dad knows you, my brother knows you. So, will you please help us out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2513)|
| 0:42:04| Okay, thank you very much, Robert. Now, we'll, we'll talk with the engineering department again to see everything we can do to make it safe within the budget that we have to work with, but I very much appreciate you coming tonight to talk to us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2524)|
| 0:42:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| And thank you, Brenda Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight. My name is Renee Hoyos. I'm the executive director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2543)|
| 0:42:32| And I've got a couple things I want to talk to you about. Um, it's kind of fortuitous that I'm talking to you before you'll be going to learn about development tools, um, in your workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2552)|
| 0:42:42| We just recently released this report, um, on TDEX enforcement. And I brought copies, if anybody's interested. It looks at the 2008 enforcement data, um, of the water pollution control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2562)|
| 0:42:52| And the, what we found was that it was a pretty bad job. Um, there wasn't a lot of enforcement going on by the state, which unfortunately means that the burden of enforcing stormwater regulations, which is, you know, one of my favorite topics, um, it may, it, it brings the burden down to more and more municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2572)|
| 0:43:12| And so, um, what I've actually come to ask you about, Mayor Haslam, is, uh, we are very concerned about the UT site. Um, the site that's on the corner of Kingston Pike and Nayland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2592)|
| 0:43:24| It's the sorority housing project. It's becoming unfashionably known as UT's Big Orange. It's putting off a lot of sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| We've been watching and sampling from that site since December, and the numbers that we're getting off that site are very high. There, uh, the sediment is measured in, in, um, NTUs. Um, it's kind of a long, weird, scientific, uh, term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2612)|
| 0:43:47| But the state will be soon considering a numeric limit of 280, and we're getting anywhere from 700 to over 1,000 NTUs off that site. So it's getting pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2627)|
| 0:43:57| We have a lot of photo documentation of that site. Big Orange plumes going right, right out into the Tennessee River. We've contacted UT Chancellor Jimmy Cheek, and I believe we've sent a letter to stormwater asking for you to step in and, uh, use your influence to have them stop, uh, polluting the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2637)|
| 0:44:15| They're under a different permit. You have really no enforcement authority, but you can use your influence to get them to, uh, reduce pollution. What's particularly galling to us is that UT teaches the sediment and erosion control class. So they're actually a really, setting a really bad example for the developers that they're supposed to be teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2655)|
| 0:44:34| Um, so again, uh, if you need to see more information, it's on our website at www.tcwn.org. It's under, uh, current events. It's called UT's Big Orange, and there's a lot of photos of orange mud going into the Tennessee River. Um, if anybody would like copies of the report, I've got them, and I'll stick around after and, uh, explain some of the data that we collected. It's pretty interesting. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2674)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you, Renee. Uh, that being all the business to come before us, we stand adjourned. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2701)|
| 0:45:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100518?start=2731)|
