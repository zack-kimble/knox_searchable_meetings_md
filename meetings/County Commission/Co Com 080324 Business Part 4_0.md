| 0:00:00| Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4)|
| 0:00:06| Yes, I've got some questions for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=6)|
| 0:00:10| This is the thing that me and Bob talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=10)|
| 0:00:18| The way I see my options is that I either need to fully disclose the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=18)|
| 0:00:24| and take up more time at 12 o'clock, or I can abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=24)|
| 0:00:29| Do I see my options as correctly, that I can just abstain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=29)|
| 0:00:34| or do I have to go through the whole mess anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| Well, what I envisioned earlier and what I thought I stated was that whenever we got to this item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=37)|
| 0:00:44| that you could refer back to that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| You've already had that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| Okay, so I don't have to go through all the details and spend 15 minutes going through the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=49)|
| 0:00:55| We have the minutes of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| If you wish to defer back to it, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| Okay, I mean, just be said we had a discussion, and I'm going to abstain from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=60)|
| 0:01:12| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| If I might digress just a moment, I think Commissioner Briggs makes a very good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| I'd like to suggest that we have a luncheon, since we can't talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| that you and I host a luncheon on April 28th, which is our regular commission day at 11 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| and I'll buy lunch for our commissioners so it doesn't come out of taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| But if that's okay with the commissioners, we can do it in the room adjacent to us and do it April 28th at 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| I just throw that out as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| I'll be happy to buy lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Every commissioner can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| On April 28th at 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| That's county commission day because some of us are on the pension board and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| We meet at 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| I'll come up with another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| What about 12 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Well, they give us an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| What about 12 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| You'll get out about 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Let me say 11.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| 11.45 we'll send out the proper notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| I was one of those that brought these amendments forward because I felt like this group had worked hard on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| and I felt like it deserved discussion and debate, and it has certainly done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| It has created a lot of discussion and debate, not only among commission but in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| I do have some questions about the Charter Review Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| I served on one a couple of years ago or a year or so ago when the judge ruled about the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| and our charter was in peril and we had to have a charter review committee quickly to make the changes that were necessary for the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| But having gone through that, just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| Have we set a date as to when the first meeting would be held if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| as to when this charter review would have its first meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| This Monday, you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| This Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Is this enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| This causes me a little heartburn because it's August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| If it were November, I would have a little bit better grasp of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| but because we're talking about August and you're talking about early voting, here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| If we start Monday, you're looking at March 31st, basically April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| So you're looking at April, May, June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| You said 91 days, Mr. Law Director, as to the amount of time that they would actually have to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| From today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| From today to actually get these done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| When you're dealing with a lot of people and a lot of different schedules, I'm wondering if that's enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| Does it have to be on the August ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| Is there something that we could put on for November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| The answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| If you create a charter review committee now, it's yes and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| If you create a charter review committee now, then by our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| the charter review committee are required to submit whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| the amendments that they come up with, to the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| between 45 and 60 days prior to the next general election, next following its appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=246)|
| 0:04:13| So if you create them now, they must submit their changes to the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| If you create them after August 7, they would be required to submit their changes to the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| You have two general elections coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| August and November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Right now they would have 91 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| If you created them after August 7, they would have about five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| So they couldn't come in and say we're not through with our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| We want to delay this and put it on the November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| They would have to do it either August or November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| They are required by the charter to submit their changes to the election commission between 45 and 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=283)|
| 0:04:54| And what I've done, I've chosen the 45 day, which gives them 91 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| Now, they also have the option of certifying to the mayor and to the commission via a statement that they do not recommend amending the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=299)|
| 0:05:09| And so if the group were to meet and decide that they didn't want to recommend any changes, let's say they ran out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| They've decided now that they do not wish to make changes to the charter, do not wish to recommend amending the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=317)|
| 0:05:25| and they are hopeful for a new charter review committee to be established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| and they are hopeful for the mayor to appoint the same persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| and they are hopeful that this commission will ratify that same group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| then you could establish a new charter review committee to study revisions to the charter that would go on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=339)|
| 0:05:47| Again, they would have about five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Because the changes, if you count 45 days back from November, what is it, seven, I believe it is, you're looking at mid-September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=350)|
| 0:05:58| But it wouldn't be the same because William wouldn't be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| Unless some of the commissioners would no longer be serving, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| According to our charter, it should be the duty of the charter review committee to give ample opportunity to county office holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| and members of the general public to make suggested changes to this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| This is very narrowly defined, so I'm assuming that this resolution would not allow the public or office holders to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| Oh, sure, it will allow them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| But they will be allowed to make suggestions, as they did in 2006, as my predecessor advised this commission in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=389)|
| 0:06:39| to make suggestions for changes within the narrow call of the mayor as ratified by this commission. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| So, in other words, they wouldn't be able to bring up a whole new charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| It would have to be within the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| It would have to be related to these eight amendments and to these nine ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| And, you know, if you want to think about it, what's left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| You've got nine ordinances that address virtually every aspect of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| You've got eight proposed petition changes that address nearly every aspect of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| You're talking about basically restructuring the entirety of Knox County government through these eight petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=437)|
| 0:07:29| or through these nine ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| So I really don't know what's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Commissioner Lambert has suggested that he wished to bring a tax issue up before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| That's probably improper under this proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| But other than that, like I say, it's a pretty all-inclusive review of the Knox County Charter by virtue of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=466)|
| 0:08:00| Well, I was going to say that I would like to see us vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| If the legislature is not going to give us the opportunity to have a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| if we have three or more appointments at one time, I'd like to see us consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| But under this, we wouldn't be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| But I really don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| You're welcome to have an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| This commission can also, you know, in conjunction with this, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| you can pass ordinances on two readings and add items to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| You still have that power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| The last thing that causes me a little bit of heartburn is the fact that once this review committee is established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| whatever they say goes directly to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| It does not come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| Would it be proper to add some language to this that the Charter Review Commission shall report back to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=524)|
| 0:08:52| on any changes it is proposing to the charter for commission input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| So, in other words, once this is done, it goes directly to the election commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| Through the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| I agree with the sentiments of Roundtree and Briggs and Luthold and Elaine Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| and a lot of other folks that have participated in these public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| And I really believe that we started to hear from the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| I really think Knox County, one question, was more of a think tank type of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| And I really think that the type of forums that county commission has been holding has been more of the public forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| that should take place and in the Baker Center research indicates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| and I've read this a couple of times in various places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| but their summary says if government is to be citizen directed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| the public must be afforded the opportunity to develop specific ideas about how it can be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| An important starting point is defining options and alternatives upon which meaningful direction can be based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| are examples of practices in other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| And this was, of course, paid for by a benefactor in Knox County, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| I also believe that the people who wrote our charter in Section D, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| on or before March 1, 1996, and on or before March 1 of each eight years thereafter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=618)|
| 0:10:25| it shall be the duty of the mayor to appoint by proclamation a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| So I have a question for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| Does this mean that the writers of our charter really thought that maybe ample opportunity would be afforded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=633)|
| 0:10:42| if the proclamation was declared on or before March 1 of that year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=642)|
| 0:10:50| What you look to, Commissioner, what I look to is I go back to Section 1.01 of our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=650)|
| 0:11:04| where it talks about the powers and functions of our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| And basically, we are advised to construe the grants of power to county government liberally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=669)|
| 0:11:19| And if we construe grants of powers to county government liberally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| then we do not read in the word only within that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=683)|
| 0:11:31| That does not mean that only every eight years your county mayor, as well as the commission through its ratification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=691)|
| 0:11:43| is limited to addressing charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| I don't read the word only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Did I say only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| No, I'm just telling you, I don't read that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| So that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| At least every eight years, basically, if you read the charter liberally, if you construe it liberally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=718)|
| 0:12:05| at least every eight years the mayor shall, he shall, initiate a charter review committee to be ratified by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=725)|
| 0:12:16| I believe that you can do it more often than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| That's the advice that my predecessor gave this body two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| It's the process that we went through in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| The amendments that were the subject of the litigation in 2006 by Chancellor Weaver were brought to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| through charter review committee amendments in November, and they were passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| That's exactly why we now have, I think, a cured charter in operation in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=759)|
| 0:12:49| Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| I also, if we are referring to Section 1.01 and we have a, that Knox, that we have the power to county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=771)|
| 0:13:02| shall liberally construed, does that mean that I think that the charge that the mayor has just to deal with these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=782)|
| 0:13:11| that this Knox Charter Petition Group is rather limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| I mean, shouldn't we have a more liberal application to the charge as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| What you have is a proclamation before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| This is a proclamation that was requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| At least if you vote on it today, you have a resolution to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| The mayor heard the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| The mayor has answered the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| He's provided you with a proclamation to address those items that at least some members of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| expressed at its committee meetings that it wished to have a charter review committee to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| That's what you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| It is a limited call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| But once I say that, when you look at it, it's almost all inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=841)|
| 0:14:09| I mean, there's not a lot left in our charter to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| If you're basically changing every elected office virtually to an appointed office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| if you're talking about changing the legislative body from its current structure of 19 to 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| Well, you say there's plenty of others to talk about, Commissioner, but in actuality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| you're really talking about restructuring the way we sit here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| I don't know that there's anything much more comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Yes, I'd like just to make a couple of points, and I really agree with everything that everyone has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=888)|
| 0:14:56| And to get first of all to the point that Commissioner Davis made about the non-elected people outnumbering the elected people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| according to the charter, that always happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| is that there's the minimum that can be appointed to the commission are ten citizens and nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| So anytime we have a charter review commission, the citizens will always outnumber the elected people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=912)|
| 0:15:19| Probably if I had my druthers, and we talked about this before we realized that if we appoint the commission now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| that we do have this deadline of August the 5th hanging over us rather than November the 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| something to throw out and to consider is if the commission did convene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| and then did as much work as they could by the deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| and then submitted those to the election commission to be put on the ballot that were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| then there may be some benefit of rather than having eight or nine amendments on the ballot plus others that may appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| which could potentially confuse the electorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| There may be some advantages of even splitting these things off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| and putting some of them on the ballot in August and some of them on the ballot in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Even if it did require reconvening a new commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| because some of the people that are appointed on here will not be in office after August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| I guess it will be September the 1st is when the new people actually take office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| And if you look at the eight that the charter petition committee or the charter petition group are looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| probably five of those eight you could clear up the language very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| and have those ready to go on the ballot in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| And then there's two or three that will provoke a lot of discussion and a lot of controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| And those could be worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| If we met the deadline, I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| But if we didn't meet the deadline, that might even be better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| because then that would give additional time for public input, for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| and put those on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| The only thing about trying to put these things off for a couple of years is that we have done a pretty good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| of educating the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| We've had forums in many of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| I think it's been in the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| I think probably the public is going to be about as well informed as possible by the time the election rolls around on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1044)|
| 0:17:34| If we put these things off a couple of years, I think interest will wane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Or if we do put those back on, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| they're just more likely for people not to understand again what they're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| And I've heard people say that before about some of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| They did not understand what they were voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| My question to the law director is if we decide to postpone these until after the general election in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1072)|
| 0:18:01| when would be the next general election that these could be put on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| And then, effectively, they probably wouldn't take place until the next election after that, which would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1091)|
| 0:18:22| Well, there wouldn't be an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| I mean, some of them could become effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| Some could become effective September 1, 2010, if the vote is in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| But what you're going to have is you'll have a law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| You'll have a property assessor who have four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| Those four-year terms begin September 1 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| If the amendments to make those divisions of our government appointed divisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1130)|
| 0:19:01| if those amendments were to pass in August and they became effective September 1, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| then those two positions would be appointed beginning in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1148)|
| 0:19:18| In other words, they would only have a term of office of two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| If you wish to put those amendments on the November ballot, then they have a property right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| have a property interest in their office for a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| And so you'll be running into that in 2010 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| That's if the amendments go on as presently written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| That's part of the reason that I propose that we let this charter review committee look at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1182)|
| 0:19:50| and clear up that ambiguous, confusing, and potentially litiginous language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| and try to get that cleared up so when we put things on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| there really won't be any confusion in people's minds as to what they're really voting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| and what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| And, again, I don't know what the intentions are of the charter petition group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| but if we don't act on these, and I really don't want to be held hostage by them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| and I think there is more of a spirit of cooperation just as Commissioner Roundtree mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| but I'm not certain that they would be willing to wait and not proceed with the petition process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| if the earliest that they would have anything on the ballot would be in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| I guess that's a question we would have to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| But, again, you know, I really hesitate to go through that petition process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| because we talk a lot about saving the taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| And if they put four or five of those things on there, we're talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| perhaps even hundreds of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| And it's not the petitioner that pays that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| It is the taxpayers that would pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Well, listen, Dr. Briggs there, I'm a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| This is not my original question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Is what he's saying true, that the taxpayer pays for the signatures by the charter petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| That's not true, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| We pay the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| It's taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| It's taxpayers that does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| I called Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| I wasn't sure about that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| I thought maybe the petitioners would have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| But he says, no, it will be the taxpayers in the county that pays for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| And he gave me the example, and it was one that I hadn't followed closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| When they did the petition about when the city did the petition on the hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| I think there were 13,000 people that signed the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| and it cost the county $17,000 to certify those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| And he said there is an economy of scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| But he said, you know, if you're talking about 40, anywhere from 40 to 360,000 signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| that it would probably, you could probably count on about a dollar a signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| Mr. Chair, I really don't want to yield the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| I do have a question, but Ms. Shepard has been there for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| Could we recognize her first before my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| You still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| You want me to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| I'm concerned about the time question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| And, you know, originally all along I have wondered about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| or worried about the public being educated enough to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| And I think by this review process here, the proclamation in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| I think that will be a lot more active than any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| What I do have a problem with is the list of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| I know some, and some I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| And I think Ms. Davis makes several good points along with all the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| I think probably all these people will do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| They've stepped forward evidently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| But I would really like to see the resume of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| because I don't know them before I turned over the whole charter thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| I'd like to know them just a little bit more than on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| Now, how do we go about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| I don't know that it can be brought up during the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| or if we'd have to have a special called meeting in ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Well, or if it can even be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| We can have a special called and pass on this tonight and vote in ten days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| if the mayor puts it back forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| You have five days to ratify or not this proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| And I guess my question, can that be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| The next meeting is the Board of Zoning Appeals, I imagine, this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| So it would have to be a special called meeting if you passed on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1434)|
| 0:24:04| So in maybe having a called election ten days is not so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| We're talking about splitting it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| August, November, delay at each commission to gather their thoughts just a little bit more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| Commissioner, you'd ask that Ms. Shepard speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Are you prepared to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Okay, Ms. Shepard, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Tamara Shepard, 4612 Meredith Road, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| Mr. Vice Chair, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| I hope to share an analogy that may not have crossed your minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| with regard to these conversations about time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| In an earlier conversation tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| the commission was talking about the likely urgency of responding to two department audits that are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1484)|
| 0:24:55| I understand that sense of urgency you feel as being in response to this realization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| that there are some problems or have been some problems in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| that you want to assure don't take place again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| The analogy that I would like to offer with regard to these suggestions to maybe wait until 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| is that the observation behind some of these proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| is that Knox Charter Petition 2 has observed some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| And we feel, I shouldn't say we because I'm not recently active in the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| but I know that Knox Charter Petition feels a sense of urgency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| to make sure that these situations relating to holes in our practices are not postponed for too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1539)|
| 0:25:48| In particular, the thought that the fee offices lack oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| I can't imagine putting off an inquiry into what might be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| and there may be multiple solutions to that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| but I can't imagine putting off an inquiry for two years on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| I can't imagine putting off for two years an inquiry as to the propriety of a county employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| voting on his own budget for his own department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| These are pressing questions, too, the same way that questions raised in recent departmental audits are pressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| And I would ask that you think about the proposals that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| before you consider postponing them for an unreasonable length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| I hope to raise a question, too, if I could, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| I happened to speak to former Commissioner Frank Luthold several times last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| with regard to his understanding of the charter text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| and in his capacity as one of the authors of the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| It's Dr. Luthold's recollection that this clause about next state or county election was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1613)|
| 0:27:02| did he speak with you on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Well, as an author of the text, it is his recollection that that phrasing is presented that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| not to instruct that the ballot initiative has to be placed on one or the other of those two election ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1631)|
| 0:27:19| His recollection is that they simply wanted to instruct that no special election could be called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| solely for the purpose of voting on charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| And he's spoken with his peer in that task, Richard Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| and it's Richard Beeler's recollection, too, that that was their purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Commissioner Luthold, I think you and I spoke briefly on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Did I understand correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| I think you're on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Which would seem to indicate that this group would, in fact, have until November under Dr. Luthold's purported purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1668)|
| 0:28:01| I hear you talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| I've also talked with one of my predecessors, Richard Beeler, who helped create the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| and I don't know that he has that same recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| Even if he did, I don't know that it would matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| because if that's what they meant, they should have said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| What they have said is not more than 60 days and not less than 45 days prior to the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1701)|
| 0:28:31| next following its appointment, the Charter Review Committee shall certify the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1711)|
| 0:28:41| those amendments that it believes ought to be placed before the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| Another point that Dr. Luthold made with regard to that interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| he suggested that it wouldn't make sense to purposefully confine the time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| to a shorter length of time than might be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| and he pointed to the decision ultimately on term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| He said ultimately term limits were withheld because it was ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1745)|
| 0:29:14| Well, it wasn't ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| It was absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| It was absent in the state law as to, or the state constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| as to whether or not we could have term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| and the ruling ultimately was one that said, well, in the absence of clear instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| let's not make this more restrictive than it has to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| and it was Dr. Luthold's contention that in this clause of the charter too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| in the absence of clear instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| let's not interpret this to be more restrictive than it has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| I belabor this point because I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| given the importance of this process and the breadth of this task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| that maybe commissioners would be more receptive if you were comfortable with this notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| that the charter allows a November 4th ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| It does allow a November 4th ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| and as long as the Charter Review Committee is initiated after August 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| I think the charter is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| If they meant something otherwise, they should have said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| You know, this is not the point in time where we wish to make a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| where we wish to go back into the minds of the charter creators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1827)|
| 0:30:36| We actually try to go back into the minds of the charter creators back in our most recent litigation over term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1836)|
| 0:30:46| over quote deficiencies unquote within the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| None of that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| It's what is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| It's what's provided, and ultimately what the Supreme Court determines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| But to me it's clear as a bell, and you can read it for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| The next general election next following its appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Now, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| What general election is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| That's August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| If you create it after August, what general election next following its appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| That's November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| After November 7, what general election next following its appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| That's 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| August 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you, Mr. Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Yes, this is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| John, you correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| If they go through this petition process, they were going to put it in a block of four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Well, then that's all the election commission would be approving then would these two instead of each one of them independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| wouldn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Mr. Lauder, I had a question about that, because if you look at 209-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1905)|
| 0:31:54| it says that each ordinance, emergency ordinance or resolution shall become effective, which embraces more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1914)|
| 0:32:03| Well, I think I got on the wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| But I think you can always cite it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Oh, you're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| But what the petitioners have to submit is not an ordinance resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| What the commissioners are submitting doesn't really apply to that paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| What this commission submits to the election commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| And we can only have an ordinance that contains one subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| We have nine separate ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| We have nine separate ordinances to be considered to go to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| There is an argument that what the petitioners have done, at least in their first instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1957)|
| 0:32:47| was provide for five amendments through one ballot question and four through another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| There is an argument that that does not comply with the spirit of our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1973)|
| 0:33:03| They have since, I believe, filed further amendments, individual amendments, and they may be filing others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| I think they hear some talk of that very same conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| But there's nothing specifically on point that requires them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| But it does us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| And what is before you and what you may consider, what did we say, through the May meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| are ordinances of your own to pass upon two-thirds vote of this body to make amendments to this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| And we'll do those one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Commissioner Pinkson, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Well, in other words, you're saying it wouldn't be near as expensive as what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| if they go through with the petition drive, as what we were led to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| No, I think it would still be about $40,000 each petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| But we'd just have two petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| It would be about $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| That's the way I'm taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| But I thought a while ago you were talking about, you know, nine could be $320,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| I don't know how they're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| You know, almost at this point in the last meeting, about an hour from now, a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2048)|
| 0:34:17| we had just approved seven of the nine ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| And if we were to do that tonight, then they really would only have two to be placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| And I'm sure they would put those two on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| They may put those on individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| So you'd be talking about counting signatures for those few petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| John, these petitions that they've gave us here, you know, these were, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2079)|
| 0:34:48| the citizen input, they're changing one dramatically here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| Now, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Can they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Can't make substantial changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Well, wouldn't a substantial change be taking a property assessor out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| It's pretty substantial, don't you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| I mean, you're talking about going from an appointed official to an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| Commissioners, I want to get to you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| I want to let the lady speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| If you would give us your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| I'm Beatrice Waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| And if you would put the microphone down near your mouth there and we can hear you better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| I'm Beatrice Waters, and I live at 7508 Kenneman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| I have voted in Knox County for 65 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| I've seen all these groups come and want to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| I have a copy of all the charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| I voted against the license that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| Don't care to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| I believe in fair government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| I believe in the people to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| And I don't believe in a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| I'll get it right in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| But I've been active in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| We were in business 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| I've worked in the communities, worked in the Republican parties from Knox County, the state of Tennessee, and the national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2167)|
| 0:36:17| So I'm against all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I think it's time to let the people in the communities speak, not a group of people to tell us how to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2179)|
| 0:36:28| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| I just want to say that, I mean, there is a rush to put these on the ballot and amend the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2191)|
| 0:36:41| We're in a very unstable time in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| When the body reconstitutes itself after the next election, we'll have had five separate legislative bodies in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| If these charter amendments pass, we will have had three separate charters within a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2213)|
| 0:37:01| This is the equivalent of having the local version of a constitutional convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| And, again, I'm going to abstain from this because I had some conversations about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| But I'm just telling you, we do not need to be in a rush to do something this important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| Commissioner Briggs, did you have other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| We talked that we could go ahead and pass some of the amendments that they did pass on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| But I think there's some seriously flawed language in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| And even those that we may agree upon, I think there's some bad language in there that would need to be cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| And sometimes I think it's better off for us, rather than trying to fix every one of these just on relatively short notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| I don't know when we would do it, whether it's now or after the election or next year or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| But sometimes you need more careful consideration about what you're actually putting in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| And I'm really not advocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| I have serious concerns about some of the amendments, whether they should be passed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| And I can tell you there's going to probably be some that I would vote against as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| But my main concern is that we have clean amendments that can be easily understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| that when the voters vote on them, they know what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| And they don't have ambiguities, and they don't get us caught up in some sort of litigation in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Mr. Law Director, would we be able to break some of these into several amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2308)|
| 0:38:49| We discussed that there are several of them that have several different components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| that actually could be several different amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Would the group have the ability to do that, or do we have to look at just the nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2337)|
| 0:39:05| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| The county commission itself, break it down, or the charter review committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| The charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Could they break those down, or do they have to remain as nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| They can consider any and all of these as possible amendments to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| Okay, but can we take, like, I'm just throwing out one, number 105,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| and break it down to where you have 10 or 11 as opposed to the nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| Sure, as long as you're dealing with the same subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| I've been to every one of the forums, and I know that it's been stated that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| and I went to the Bearden-Knox County One Question Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| and I know that it's been stated that there was probably 500 or 600 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| that participated in Knox County One Question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| and I'm just going to assume that that figure is true and accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| What concerns me is that in all of the forums that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| if there's still such a great upswelling or concern about changes in our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| why have we not had that same population of people attend these forums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| We have not seen the same number of people standing up for these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| as we have people saying, we don't want any of these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| I have gotten more phone calls, more e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| more people talk to me in person saying that they want no part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| and that if the petition group wants to move forward, that let them do it on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| And that's the response that I've been getting from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| And my concern with regard to the newspaper is the only articles we've seen about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| have been with regard to Mr. Freese's forum and then some letters from the editor today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2452)|
| 0:41:00| and it's all just let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| We haven't seen any balance that has really talked about the content of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| not whether or not people can vote on them or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| but the actual what these amendments will do to our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| And that's a real concern for me that we have not seen that sort of information been put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| And I'm not getting on you, Ainsley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| but I think that that's important to have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| And I haven't seen it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| I haven't seen support for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| I haven't seen a balanced educational process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| I don't believe that the number of commissioners that are going to be on this Charter Review Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| have institutional knowledge about our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| We've just been appointed February the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| and then here we are instructed to turn around and change our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| And I do have a lot of respect for these commissioners, and they're very intelligent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| but this is a great burden to place on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| considering the fact that some of us will only be here until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| And I just feel like that, you know, Commissioner Luthold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| and then also Commissioner Scott Moore at the very beginning of this process said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| what's the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| And I've heard answers to the logistics of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| but I've not heard any philosophical answers as to the rush of why we need to have these changes in our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| when we've not allowed term limits to take effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| when we've not allowed the process of new commissioners to come in in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| and let those new commissioners place and restore trust in our local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| Commissioner Bingson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| I'm going to make a motion to deny the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| The motion on the floor is to deny the proclamation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| which would in effect deny the establishment of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Mr. Chairman, I'll turn it over to you for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| A point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| The motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| We need a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Commissioner Bowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Can I make a substitute to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| It's already a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| You can do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| I'd like to make a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| We've already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Hadn't we voted already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| I'm sorry, I thought we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| I'd like to make a substitute motion that would call a special call election in ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| I don't think discussion is really over and ended tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| Gather the resumes from the people that's on the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| and if we want to do what Dr. Briggs did, we can also at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| could we not, Mr. Law Director, have a second ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| and maybe weed out or pass some of those that we've already passed on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2624)|
| 0:43:57| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| First of all, you've got five days to approve of this proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| So if you set a meeting ten days from now, it's pointless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| Do we need to go any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Not unless the mayor wants to come down and say he'll resubmit it in five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| And secondly, the proclamation that's before you is not here for you to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| and choose who the members are on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| It is here for ratification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| If you disagree with this proclamation, then I would assume you would vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| If you agree with it, agree with its concept, do not mind its narrowed focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| do not mind the appointees to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| You understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| But you've got five days by charter to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I'll withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| I'm going to make really we'll vote on it the same way, only maybe a little bit different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| is that I want to make a motion that we vote for the resolution with an amendment to approve the mayor's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2720)|
| 0:45:29| I think that's saying the same thing that you're doing, only it would vote the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| My motion was to deny this charter review committee to turn down the mayor's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2734)|
| 0:45:44| Well, I'm saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| What Commissioner Briggs is saying is that to approve of the resolution with an amendment to ratify the mayor's proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2746)|
| 0:45:55| Up or down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| I'm saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| We're just doing it different, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| It's a motion to approve the proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| What you have before you is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| It has asked the mayor to form a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| By amending the resolution to also include consideration of the proclamation, you're killing two birds with one stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2774)|
| 0:46:24| You're first considering your request, whether this commission wishes to request the mayor to come up with a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2784)|
| 0:46:33| Secondly, you're voting to ratify the proclamation that's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| All of that within one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| John, it's 1245.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| You're going to have to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| I'm getting a puzzled look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| So is this like, so instead of saying no, no, or yes, no, or no, yes, you just up or down the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| We need up or down the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| No, I mean up or down the proclamation and the committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| We have a motion on the floor to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Right now, you don't have, I mean, with an amendment that's properly seconded, you will have a proclamation before you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Right now, all you have is a resolution that requests that the mayor establish a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| And so it needs to be amended to also include consideration of this or we need to come back in five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2844)|
| 0:47:31| Yeah, but he's got to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| But we have a motion on the floor to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| I will second Commissioner Briggs' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| And then there was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Well, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| He withdrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| But what I'm trying to do is get this done in one vote rather than in two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| But you are making a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| It's the same thing as his, only we're doing two things at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| And the substitute motion is to approve of the resolution with an amendment to ratify the mayor's proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| That's the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| And a vote yes and a vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| I think if you tell with a vote yes and a vote no, it cleared up for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| A vote yes means that you are all in favor of the charter review committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| of the establishment of the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| A vote no, you're not in favor of establishing a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| Yes, you're for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| No, you're against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| I think that clears it up for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| I don't know that I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| Who seconded his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| We have a substitute motion to whatever he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| I'll approve the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Mr. Chairman, could we do a roll call on this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Hey, does everybody know how to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| What a yes and no means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Is everyone clear on yes and no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| If you're for it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| If you're not for it, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| And that's just the committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| We're voting just for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| No, it's the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| The whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Well, it's the committee plus the resolution that asked the mayor to form a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| It's in the book, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| It's in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| That part is in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| You also have the proclamation before you, which has now been amended into the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| Is everybody clear on their vote, what yes and no means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Yes, you're for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| No, you're against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2967)|

| 0:49:39| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| He's making a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=2986)|

| 0:52:27| I'll get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3147)|

| 0:52:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| A quick question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| The author of this is prepared by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| I have a question regarding the list that begins on page 2 of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| I think that means to be a list of properties that are covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| but it almost reads because of the does not apply to any property used for agricultural purposes, colon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| It almost reads like a list of properties that aren't covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| I just want to make sure I understand the intent of that whole list there that begins on page 2 of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3186)|
| 0:53:18| Talking about the definition of blotted or deteriorated property, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Yeah, it seems because that colon comes after a sentence that describes something that is not covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| that it sort of implies that the remaining list is not covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| when I think it means that they are or should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Such term, blotted or deteriorated property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| does not apply to any property used for agricultural purposes with those caveats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| With those caveats meaning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| For agricultural purposes, which because of physical condition or use is regarded, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| Those are the ones that are exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| Are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3247)|

| 0:54:14| Should have been written better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3255)|

| 0:54:21| 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| This is to amend Article VI, Section 6.04 of the Knox County Charter to provide for the election of the Knox County Superintendent of Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3264)|
| 0:54:34| This is the Knox County Charter as adopted 11888 as amended through referendums of 8196 and 8604, first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3274)|

| 0:54:47| N-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| I'm going to try to make a stab at something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| What I think we should do is 102 and 103, I think we should pass those on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| set up the community forums the way we did for the charter amendments, and treat these exactly the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| These are both items that are going to require lengthy debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| and I think that if we treat these just like we did those last charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| and pass both of these on first reading and then go out into the community and have our community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| I think it worked great for the charter amendments, and I think it worked great for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| If we don't do that, I mean, it's 1 o'clock in the morning, and these are things that will require lengthy debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| and so that's why I'm making that suggestion, because I think that they do need some debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| and I think they need debate that's out in the community the way they were for the charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Commissioner Lambert, the State Supreme Court has ruled with regards to the school superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| and we have a copy of that State Supreme Court ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| So I believe that this issue is moved unless Mr. Pinkston has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| When was that ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| Was that before we become a charter county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| No, our charter became effective September of 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| And then you had the EIA, which was passed by the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| which then took away every county's right to elect their superintendent, including ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3389)|
| 0:56:40| and the Supreme Court ruled in 1996 in the case that I provided you, Shelby County v. McWhirter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3400)|
| 0:56:50| that the EIA Education Improvement Act is supreme and that we can't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3410)|
| 0:57:02| We can't, through our charter, we can't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| So state law trumps our charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| In this instance, the Educational Improvement Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| Why does not state law trump everything on our charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| That's what I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| I'd like that to be made clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| It trumps this, but other things it don't trump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| I can't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Is state law stronger than our charter just on some issues or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| Well, you'll also note that we have term limits for all of our officials, virtually, with the exception of school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| And the judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| State law trumps our charter term limits provision regarding school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| Which is a qualification issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| But the ballot question was all elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| But that issue has been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| But we were told that state law couldn't trump this provision, one of these amendments, where the county employees couldn't run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3481)|
| 0:58:13| You know, we don't want to compare apples with oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| Well, I mean, the state law says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| That's all I can go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Especially not at 1 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| We've talked about it a number of times, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| I can sit here until 8 a.m., take the day off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| I'll be glad to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| All I'm asking, though, is how do you arrive at when state law trumps and when it doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| Case by case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| The Supreme Court has already addressed the superintendent issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| They've already addressed the term limits issue as they apply to board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| Those we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| We know this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| We know the answer to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| I, like you, would like to see an elected superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| But, you know, I'm not here to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| But, yes, I would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| The Supreme Court has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| To approve and have forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| But we haven't finished our forms on the Charter Committee yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Mr. Law Director, what if this amendment was written in such a way that if in the future state law changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| and allows local governments to decide which way they want to have either an elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3563)|
| 0:59:31| versus an appointed school superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| that then we wouldn't have to go back to the voters to change our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| because the charter states that it is to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| If we could write it in a way that if state law allows for an elected school superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| then that's what we will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| Just simply if state law changes, then we would have to then go back to the voters to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| When state law changes, this body can pass an ordinance on two readings to be placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| And then that's when it would have to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Very easily done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| I'll separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| I'll bundle those then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| I'm going to try this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| I'd like to make a motion that number 103, 101, 102, 103 again, 106, 107, 108, 109,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3625)|
| 1:00:34| be deferred for 30 days and to be included in any subsequent forms that we may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| I know we haven't had one in the fifth district yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| We're waiting to see about the formation of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| But this way yours, Mr. Lambert, would be included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Well, could we go ahead and pass it on first reading so that would put these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3647)|
| 1:00:55| so that they would have even standing as we go out to the community for the debates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| It would just put them on an even footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| So the motion is we pass 103 on first reading and then defer the others until. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Well, I think we're still on. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| We're on 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| We're on 102, and we need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| I'll just make a motion to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I'll just make a motion to withdraw 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| You're withdrawing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Yeah, Commissioner Lambert made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| I was just trying to go ahead and move us along here that we do 103 on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| and the rest of them we defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| You made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| You just made an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Yeah, he made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| So it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Yes, I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Law Director, you previously stated we have to vote on ordinances individually, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| Oh, we're definitely not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| We're. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| But we're not going to do them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| 102 has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| From what I hear, 103, 101, 102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| and all these ordinances on second reading are being deferred until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Well, 103 is being voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Well, then vote on 103 and vote on. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| I'll make a motion to do 103 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| 102 has been what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Who is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Pinkston, the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| Who's on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| He made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| On ordinance 102 on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Commissioner Lambert made the original motion to approve the resolution and set up community forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| I bundled them together, but then Commissioner Pinkston withdrew 101, so now we're on 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| Well, what are we going to do with your motion on 102?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| Withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Mr. Chair, I believe, according to the rules, the maker of the motion can withdraw it without challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| Well, he's the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| We're waiting on Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| Well, we're the maker of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| Withdraw, Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Withdraw, Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| I'm not withdrawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| I want 103 to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Yeah, just withdraw the bundling 102 and 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| I withdraw my original motion to bundle 102 and 103, and then I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| Okay, let's hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| And I'm going to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Now, Commissioner Pinkston, you can withdraw your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| And I'll make a motion to go ahead and do 103 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| I'll read it to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Read 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| 103 is amending Article II, Section 2.01 of the Knox County Charter to provide that any and all tax increases be improved by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3827)|
| 1:03:57| Knox County Charter has adopted 11888 as amended to referendums of 8196 and 8604, first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3837)|
| 1:04:06| And a governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| Voted 6-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3848)|

| 1:04:11| N-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| I'll make a motion we do it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| We have to do it on two readings, so I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Do it on two readings, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| And this will be included in any forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| I'd like to ask John Troyer to comment on this and how this could affect our bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3864)|
| 1:04:34| I think it takes away one of the tools that this commission has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| And if there were a financial emergency, then we would potentially have to wait until the next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| which might be some time before this commission could respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| I think this commission could use this tool if it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| So I don't think you would want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| So as we've just talked about, as far as referendums, it could be, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| would this type of referendum have to wait for a general election, which could be as long as a two-year wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3903)|
| 1:05:12| We haven't defined it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| That's why I'm asking is how do you get to this referendum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| I mean, the mechanics of it are very important because if it could be redone each year, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| If you have to wait until a general election, then you're looking at only every even year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| And you could be caught, as our finance director said, for a quandary for maybe as long as two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3933)|
| 1:05:42| Again, I'm just asking you to pass this on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| We can debate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| I mean, I can debate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| I can defend it and tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| But we would be here for a few hours while we discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| All I'm asking is that we put this, is that we go ahead and pass this on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| and then we'll have lots of debate in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| There will be pros and cons to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=3966)|

| 1:09:54| I'd like to make a motion we defer these for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Just a question, does a deferral for 30 days meaning that it's in effect no longer passing on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| if it passes again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| We have to, does it reset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| No, it does not reset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| You'll have a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| In 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| In 30, well, at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| Whatever the next meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Just one more piece of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Law Director, since we passed what we passed on the Charter Commission, do we still need to have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| charter reviews in the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| That's up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| You still have seven ordinances that are in front of you for consideration next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4245)|
| 1:10:53| Mr. Briggs, Commissioner Hammond, do you have any ideas of when you would like to form the fifth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| since we're still in an open meeting here and we can discuss this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| I'm open to whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| I think, you know, with these other, I think most of them have occurred on, you know, on weekdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| and usually they're at 630 or 6 to 7 in the evening is when they've had them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| We could look at, you know, I guess going to the city hall there at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| I don't know where else we'd be able to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| That would be a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| You know, since we've deferred all these items, I would think that we would want to wait until after we vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| I think so because we really can't even tell them what the amendments are because we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| See, the amendments that we approved at first reading are not even those that are being proposed now because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| language has been changed in so many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| So I, well, it's just my suggestion, whatever you two would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| I mean, we might as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| We could have this discussion next month and find out what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| That way people know what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| I have a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| No, we've got some public forum people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Two people from my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| To the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Hey, Mr. Chairman, while we're still here and not adjourned yet, I'm going to announce a community meeting at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4336)|
| 1:12:25| for District 2 on April 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| It will go through the commission office and out, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| Yeah, I think the 5th District Commissioners, what I'm hearing is that we're going to announce our community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4352)|
| 1:12:41| after the April commission meeting to find out what exactly would be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4361)|
| 1:12:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| You too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart4?start=4373)|
