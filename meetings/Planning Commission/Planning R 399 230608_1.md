| 2:37:50| And those updates just, again, allow us to keep that data up to date and keep users informed better than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9470)|
| 2:37:59| So those are just some of the things that we've been working on that we wanted to share with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| I'll turn it over to Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9483)|
| 2:38:09| All right, thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| The Health Agency is quite good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| Our fees, intakes are already about $180,000 ahead of fee intakes versus where we are budgeted for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9497)|
| 2:38:26| Obviously, the number of cases that you have seen reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| So we'll be ending in the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| You guys will be getting a bonus at the end of this year, too, for your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| So you can look forward to that in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| Our grant revenue is about $1 million so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| That always lags by a quarter because of our billing cycle with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| but we're continuing to utilize a significant amount of our grant revenues to help pay for salaries and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| as well as pass through for a variety of studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9537)|
| 2:39:01| Our expenses are below our target right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| Primarily, as you know, we've been understaffed throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9543)|
| 2:39:08| So that is partially why we're in the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| But the good news is, as of today, we are, you know, Monday, we're fully staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9550)|
| 2:39:16| We have additional planners on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9556)|
| 2:39:19| We have additional technical support people helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| I think we have a really great staff right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| There's going to be some two to three months of additional training that's going to be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| But I think by, you know, mid-summer, early fall, that we'll be in a really good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| It takes a lot of the load off of our existing staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9575)|
| 2:39:39| And maybe we can spend some more time doing planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| and working with looking beyond just zoning and subdivision cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9583)|
| 2:39:47| and try to advance the community with planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| Obviously, with advanced NOCs, we'll be developing into the development ordinance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9592)|
| 2:39:57| But we'll be able to move forward with that in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9597)|
| 2:40:03| And so I think going forward in our budget that you approved before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| we'll be in very good shape to, again, with anticipating growth, to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9606)|
| 2:40:13| But we do have a healthy fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| We have a fund balance for about eight to ten months covering costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9616)|
| 2:40:19| in case there was going to be a significant recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9619)|
| 2:40:23| Our fund balance has grown significantly over the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| primarily because of the increased fees of what we had budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| So we're in a very good position in respect to that if we were to see a downturn in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9629)|
| 2:40:35| And the agency will be able to survive with some fees reduction in case for the fund balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9635)|
| 2:40:42| So with that note, the last point I'll make is I'm not sure who's buying, whether it's Jeff or Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9642)|
| 2:40:48| Maybe I'll see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| Mr. Chairman, before we quit, I would like to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9651)|
| 2:40:57| I was appointed in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9657)|
| 2:41:02| I want to tell you I want to recognize the staff of this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| Over the 12 years I've been involved, they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| I've always said sometimes it's a little thankless they work their tails off to make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9668)|
| 2:41:14| Sometimes we come in here after hearing for two days and go, ah, no, let's do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| But I just want to recognize the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9679)|
| 2:41:22| I think it's very important the work that they do and the work this commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9682)|
| 2:41:26| And I just want to thank them for the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9689)|
| 2:41:30| Mr. Chairman, point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| Is this large bonus why Director Welch is waiting until later in the year to actually officially retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9692)|
| 2:41:37| I think we need to investigate the timing of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| You'll have to ask Director Welch about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| Let's move on to the election of Planning Commission officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9704)|
| 2:41:51| And so at this time, if there are any floor nominations, we will accept those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9711)|
| 2:41:58| Do we have any floor nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9718)|
| 2:42:08| We have a motion to close floor nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9728)|
| 2:42:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9739)|
| 2:42:20| We've got a second by Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9745)|
| 2:42:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| So I guess we need to vote on the candidates that were selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| And that was Vice Chair Uten has again once been selected as a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9757)|
| 2:42:45| And then I have been selected as the potential chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| So let's vote on those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| Motion to approve the slate of candidates for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9776)|
| 2:42:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| We have a motion to approve by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9781)|

| 2:43:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9784)|
