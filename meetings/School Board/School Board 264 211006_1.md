| 3:17:48| When I left here in August, I had a smile and a feeling of relief, believing that our school year was going to be a great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11868)|
| 3:17:53| And honestly, for seven weeks, things were really going great until Friday, September 24th, when everything changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11873)|
| 3:18:00| I'm not going to talk about masks, but I will say that I chose not to wear one to school for the past eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11880)|
| 3:18:05| And as a result of my choice, I've spent these eight days in an isolation room inside of my school, 1,200 plus students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11885)|
| 3:18:11| There are many things that have troubled me during these days, but I just want to share a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11891)|
| 3:18:16| The attitude and treatment by some of the teachers has been deeply upsetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11896)|
| 3:18:18| Some told me that what I was doing was insignificant and that this judge doesn't care anything about me, which in itself is probably true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11898)|
| 3:18:26| I mean, some have been very unkind in the words and actions that they have said to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11906)|
| 3:18:31| I understand that supervising the isolation room is not fun for them, but it is certainly not fun for me either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11911)|
| 3:18:37| OK, even if these teachers disagree with my choice, belittling and degrading me for it is unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11917)|
| 3:18:43| With respects to meals, we have been taken as a group to the, mind you, empty cafeteria to pick up a lunch, but had to return to the isolation room to eat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11923)|
| 3:18:53| Space has been an issue for the isolation kids from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11933)|
| 3:18:58| Yesterday, we moved through four different rooms before we were even settled in by noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11938)|
| 3:19:02| But by far, my greatest concern has been that my right to an education seems to have just gone out the window, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11942)|
| 3:19:08| You see, I have sat in the isolation room most of this time with zero instruction and little or no work to provide to me on Canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11948)|
| 3:19:16| A couple of teachers have given me paper assignments, but I have not been able to take them to my teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11956)|
| 3:19:21| and only today did an isolation room supervisor offer to take my work to my classroom teachers for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11961)|
| 3:19:26| Only one teacher, my choir teacher, has allowed me to participate in class because she chose to hold classes outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11966)|
| 3:19:33| I will finish by saying this, Friday will be my last day as a KCS student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11973)|
| 3:19:39| You see, I believe that I have a right to a public education just as much as every other student in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11979)|
| 3:19:45| But I do not see anyone standing up for me or these other students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| My family and I have reached out for help about what will happen to me and my education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11990)|
| 3:19:54| and no one has said, this is the plan for you, Logan, this is the plan we have to meet your educational needs as you prepare for your senior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11994)|
| 3:20:00| What is sad is that only after my parents informed my guidance counselor and teachers today that I was leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12000)|
| 3:20:06| that anyone seemed concerned that I had not been in class or that my grades were slipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12006)|
| 3:20:11| And this is after my family and I emailed repeatedly for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12011)|
| 3:20:15| I am a good student, and I have been privileged to be a member of the Halls High School Magicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12015)|
| 3:20:21| If I am willing to sacrifice my passion for singing and the rest of my high school experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12021)|
| 3:20:26| to ensure that I receive an education by leaving KCS, what are you willing to sacrifice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12026)|
| 3:20:56| My name is Marlene Knab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12056)|
| 3:21:09| And then next is Tyrell Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12069)|
| 3:21:14| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12074)|
| 3:21:17| Yes, hello, my name is Marlene Knab, and I reside in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12077)|
| 3:21:21| I have two children at KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12081)|
| 3:21:24| Currently, one of my children has decided to wear a mask so she can continue participating in school and continue with her grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12084)|
| 3:21:34| She's in high school, and she's looking to her future, and she has made that choice for herself because she doesn't want to jeopardize her future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12094)|
| 3:21:44| My son, on the other hand, is in middle school, and he is standing up for his rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12104)|
| 3:21:49| He has been in isolation most days since the start of this mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12109)|
| 3:21:54| His grades are slipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| This is an honors student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| He has all honors classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| He's always received excellent grades, and his grades are slipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12120)|
| 3:22:05| Why? Because this board, the school system, has failed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12125)|
| 3:22:12| They've failed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| You have failed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| You've failed so many kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12136)|
| 3:22:17| Kids in isolation are not getting their constitutional right to an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12137)|
| 3:22:24| I know you can't do anything about this order from this judge, and it's unreasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12144)|
| 3:22:30| but you can change how you are dealing with these kids that do not wish to mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12150)|
| 3:22:37| You can implement some sort of educational plan for these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12157)|
| 3:22:43| My son today, I received a notification from the school system saying that one of his grades was below the expectation that I set for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12163)|
| 3:23:01| And I asked him what happened, and he said, Mom, I did the best I could by teaching myself because I have not gotten an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12181)|
| 3:23:11| That is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12191)|
| 3:23:15| It's unacceptable for my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12195)|
| 3:23:17| It's unacceptable for every single one of these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12197)|
| 3:23:20| You have a duty to instruct my son and every single child at Knox County Schools, and you're failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12200)|
| 3:23:31| And I need this to be fixed, and I need it to be fixed very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12211)|
| 3:23:36| I'm not going to keep reiterating mask mandates and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12216)|
| 3:23:43| I understand that's not within your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| I understand that you don't have the right to change that, but you do have the right to change how you are choosing to implement this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12225)|
| 3:23:56| Fix this and educate our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12240)|
| 3:24:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| Tyrell Douglas, in the name of Christine Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12245)|
| 3:24:14| Is Mr. Douglas here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12254)|
| 3:24:17| Yeah, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12257)|
| 3:24:29| Many folks have mentioned a lot of things that I've got in here, but I'm going to say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12269)|
| 3:24:35| A couple of parents told me that children who are either unable or chose to exercise their inalienable right to bodily autonomy to wear a mask are not being taught while they're in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12275)|
| 3:24:56| Knox County Schools and teachers are being paid to teach the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12296)|
| 3:25:00| It is appalling that it is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12300)|
| 3:25:02| The reason these kids go to school is to be given a proper education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12302)|
| 3:25:07| Knox County Schools have abandoned their primary responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| This is, without a question, absolutely unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| Furthermore, the fact that their children are being punished with detention without education for exercising their 14th Amendment right to choose not to wear a mask is, again, unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12315)|
| 3:25:32| Even if these kids have done something to warrant detention, it does not negate your responsibility to provide an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12332)|
| 3:25:40| There's no reason these kids should be getting zeros on their classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12340)|
| 3:25:45| The recent decision by a judge to stay the executive order to opt out from wearing a mask has absolutely no bearing on whether these kids get to choose to wear a mask or not and still get an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12345)|
| 3:26:00| Because Governor Lee's opt-out mandate is totally unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12360)|
| 3:26:06| We have a 14th Amendment right to bodily autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12366)|
| 3:26:10| Inalienable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12370)|
| 3:26:14| Since when do we have to ask permission to exercise an inalienable God-given right listed in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12374)|
| 3:26:23| It is imperative that this right not be violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12383)|
| 3:26:26| Many of these kids are susceptible to illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12386)|
| 3:26:29| And these kids are smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12389)|
| 3:26:30| They've seen the lab culture test that has recently been done that found streptococcal pneumonia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12390)|
| 3:26:37| Let me list this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| Mycobacterium tuberculosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| Meningitis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| Neisseria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| Acanthamoeba.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| That's a parasite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| Polyphaga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12409)|
| 3:26:50| E. coli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| Staphylococcus aureus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12412)|
| 3:26:55| And a deadly staphylococcus pyrogenus, serotype M3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12415)|
| 3:27:02| My granddaughter read on the box of masks, does not prevent the spread of coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12422)|
| 3:27:09| So I'm sure these other kids can read and do math and put two and two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12429)|
| 3:27:13| So contrary to common belief, masks cause illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12433)|
| 3:27:17| They do not protect the wearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| They do not protect others around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| Kids know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12441)|
| 3:27:22| Stop punishing them for not wanting to get sick and teach these kids their full curriculum while in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12442)|
| 3:27:29| Regardless of your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12449)|
| 3:27:31| Just do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12451)|
| 3:27:39| Christine Parker and then Karen Appleby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12459)|
| 3:27:49| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12469)|
| 3:27:50| My name is Christine Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12470)|
| 3:27:52| I'm in Knox District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12472)|
| 3:27:55| I think we can all agree that there are issues with the current situation with masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12475)|
| 3:28:00| Due to the original inaction by the board to approve adequate COVID measures, there are now children who are medically cannot wear masks that cannot attend school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12480)|
| 3:28:10| I feel for these children and their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12490)|
| 3:28:13| There are also a large number of children, including my child, who have contracted COVID and have spread it to their families and their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12493)|
| 3:28:22| Masks are only one part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12502)|
| 3:28:25| The bigger issue is the school board's decision to take contact tracing away from school nurses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12505)|
| 3:28:31| My child woke up with a runny nose on Sunday, August 22nd, thinking it was allergies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12511)|
| 3:28:39| I gave her some Zyrtec and she went to school on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12519)|
| 3:28:43| Monday night, I just happened to check Facebook and I found out that multiple children from her class were positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12523)|
| 3:28:50| We did an at-home test the next morning and a PCR later that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12530)|
| 3:28:55| Both were positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| No one ever called me to tell me that she was a close contact and the health department did not contact us for her contacts until nine days after her test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12537)|
| 3:29:06| She was wearing a mask, but it upsets me about how many kids she may have affected that Monday she was at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12546)|
| 3:29:13| How many families might have become sick, missed work, or ended up in the hospital because I didn't know that we needed to quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12553)|
| 3:29:20| I originally wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to the process broke down due to the volume of cases that were happening at the time that my daughter was ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12560)|
| 3:29:29| But even now, when the cases are seeming to fall and there's a lot less burden on the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12569)|

| 3:29:47| Given the importance of contact tracing to stopping the spread, I ask you to allow school nurses to return to contact tracing in the school like was done last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12587)|
| 3:29:57| The faster we stop the spread in our community, the faster, hopefully the faster we can get back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12597)|

| 3:30:14| Good evening. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12614)|
| 3:30:17| My name is Karen Appleby. I'm a resident of Knox County and I have two girls in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12617)|
| 3:30:23| Would have never thought I'd be here holding this up, asking, please educate my child, because they've been in segregation since this all started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12623)|
| 3:30:35| I strongly oppose the mask mandate given by Judge Greer, who's obviously not a doctor and or has limited knowledge and at best, at best regarding efficacy or ADA accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12635)|
| 3:30:47| Otherwise, he would not have put this mandate in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| However, I have grave concerns and strongly disagree with how you guys have implemented this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12649)|
| 3:30:58| I don't understand who in here goes, hey, guys, let's take these kids who aren't going to wear a mask and put them in a room by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12658)|
| 3:31:07| We're not going to teach them anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| Where in any of your brains did that say, oh, that's a really good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12669)|
| 3:31:14| Our kids deserve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12674)|
| 3:31:15| I mean, sit with that. Think with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12675)|
| 3:31:22| They go into these rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12682)|
| 3:31:24| They're not given instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12684)|
| 3:31:26| My children are blessed compared to several others where they're not given their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12686)|
| 3:31:30| My kids so far have been counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12690)|
| 3:31:32| Their attendance is counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12692)|
| 3:31:34| Why they've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12694)|
| 3:31:36| There's no guidance, no support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12696)|
| 3:31:38| Many of these kids I've heard have been treated like outcasts, prisoners, like they're not worthy of an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12698)|
| 3:31:43| Unless they put this thing on their face, which absolutely does not work as we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12703)|
| 3:31:50| Ironically, I looked up the Tennessee Department of Correctional Education System, which is approved by you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12710)|
| 3:31:57| Because I'm like, well, what rights do these people have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| What rights do our felons have in jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12719)|

| 3:32:09| TDOC, school districts, adult education program includes three paths, and it goes on to explain those paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12729)|

| 3:32:31| Why do felons and people in jail get an education and our children do not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12751)|
| 3:32:36| I find it disgusting, personally, and implorable as board members, as parents, as educators, and just plain old human beings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12756)|
| 3:32:46| looking at these children and going, I'm not going to educate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12766)|
| 3:32:49| Nope, you won't put this on your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12769)|
| 3:32:52| You don't deserve an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12772)|
| 3:32:56| I think that those of you who think this mandate is reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12776)|
| 3:32:59| and that these kids are being treated fairly or successfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12779)|
| 3:33:03| and that you guys are doing a great job in educating our students, should immediately step down, including you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12783)|
| 3:33:10| In your document, your bibliography on you, it says that there's three non-negotiable priorities, including enhancing students'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12790)|
| 3:33:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12798)|

| 3:33:56| So I was a combat veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| The only celebration I got was saving a life on the combat field and returning home to my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12838)|
| 3:34:05| I'm a husband, father of three daughters, college student, combat veteran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12845)|

| 3:34:14| And I have a duty to serve in all those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12854)|
| 3:34:18| As do you two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12858)|
| 3:34:20| You all have volunteered for this and have a duty to educate our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12860)|
| 3:34:25| We, the people, elected you to these positions and entrusted you with the duty and educational care of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12865)|
| 3:34:31| Yet today, our children are segregated from their fellow classmates and are being used as pawns in this political game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12871)|
| 3:34:38| as if their education or life has no value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12878)|
| 3:34:41| They are being educationally neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12881)|

| 3:35:11| This is our right and you have the duty to educate our children rather than neglect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12911)|
| 3:35:15| by shoving a computer at them or some papers that say, here, educate yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12915)|
| 3:35:20| We lost seven men fighting in Iraq who volunteered and took it seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12920)|

| 3:36:16| During this month of September of this year, 140 people died in Knox County from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12976)|
| 3:36:23| I can't talk while they're heckling from the background. Can I get back my 20 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12983)|
| 3:36:31| I didn't get my time. I was speaking about my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12991)|

| 3:36:36| Please let our speaker finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=12996)|
| 3:36:41| Alright. 140 people have died in Knox County in September alone from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13001)|
| 3:36:47| The flu kills 120 people in a year in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13007)|
| 3:36:53| This is not made up. This is facts from the Knox County Health Department and Tennessee Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13013)|
| 3:36:58| The ultimate loss of rights is the loss of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13018)|
| 3:37:01| Wearing a mask does not compare to losing a loved one or losing your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13021)|
| 3:37:08| Last year, most school board meetings had no speakers at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13028)|
| 3:37:11| This year, there have been hundreds of speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13031)|
| 3:37:14| But in 2021, a very small group of people have actually been here over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13034)|
| 3:37:18| You know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13038)|
| 3:37:20| It gives the appearance that they're a majority, but they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13040)|
| 3:37:24| Less than 1% of kids refuse to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13044)|
| 3:37:27| And they wouldn't have done that if it hadn't been such a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13047)|
| 3:37:32| This is a minority. They're fueled by misinformation and by politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13052)|
| 3:37:37| There is not a shred of evidence that masks harm children or adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13057)|
| 3:37:44| There is not. Please do not allow people to speak over me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13064)|
| 3:37:48| Please do not interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| There's not a shred of evidence that they harm children or adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13070)|
| 3:37:53| There are at least 50 studies since the start of this pandemic that show that wearing masks prevent the spread of COVID or slow it down, which makes it manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13073)|
| 3:38:05| So, this is a divisive political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13085)|
| 3:38:16| The format of these meetings don't make it easy for us to have discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13096)|
| 3:38:21| Instead, we are on sides and we're shouting at each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| There are valid concerns about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13104)|
| 3:38:29| And, unfortunately, it's hard to have those discussions about what are the valid concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13109)|
| 3:38:37| How do we address the valid concerns when it's this side or this side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13117)|
| 3:38:41| It is totally possible to make a decision that keeps the majority of people safe while also listening to those valid concerns from the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13121)|
| 3:38:54| We trust you, as elected officials, to make the right decisions, to research for yourself, and to discern the truth, science, versus misinformation and conspiracy theories and politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13134)|
| 3:39:09| That's your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13149)|
| 3:39:11| I wish you all had done it before the judge had to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13151)|
| 3:39:15| Things would have actually been a lot better and you'd have the power to address some of these concerns that people have brought before us today, which are valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13155)|
| 3:39:21| That's all I've got for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13161)|
| 3:39:24| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13164)|

| 3:40:06| I'm here to talk about the protests happening in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13206)|
| 3:40:10| For over a week, my child has been afraid to walk the path to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13210)|
| 3:40:15| After she FaceTimed me during one of her walks, I was in disbelief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13215)|
| 3:40:19| I was in disbelief to see a group of anti-mask protesters gathered outside her school doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13219)|
| 3:40:26| From then on, I have walked with her every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13226)|
| 3:40:30| Here are a few of the things I have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13230)|
| 3:40:33| I have seen a group of adults who take up most of the sidewalk and walk as if they are in their own parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13233)|
| 3:40:40| While they carry signs that mock our kids, I have seen children walking in the grass and not on the sidewalk to avoid the protesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13240)|
| 3:40:49| I watched two kids step into traffic to avoid them, one on the main road and one in the drop-off line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13249)|
| 3:40:57| I have seen the protesters gather as a group twice a day to say the pledge while holding huge flags that block most of the entrance to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13257)|
| 3:41:06| I believe in the right to peacefully protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13266)|
| 3:41:10| But there are laws and rules that govern when and where these protests can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13270)|
| 3:41:15| And if they are not followed, people can be arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13275)|
| 3:41:19| I believe that these protests should not be allowed while our children are present on school grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13279)|
| 3:41:25| I also believe walking your child to school with a group of people who are carrying signs is not a normal walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13285)|
| 3:41:32| It is a political protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13292)|
| 3:41:35| And how do I know the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| Because I have seen many parents this week, like myself, who can walk their kids to school without carrying a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13297)|
| 3:41:43| If KCS continues to allow anti-mask protests on school grounds, you are setting a precedent and will be required to allow all future protests from any political or special interest group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13303)|
| 3:41:57| You are officially making our schools into protest zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13317)|
| 3:42:01| Is that what we really want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| Over the years, our schools have found many ways to protect our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13323)|
| 3:42:08| We are buzzed into buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13328)|
| 3:42:10| We show our ID when asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13330)|
| 3:42:12| Our schools' staff wear ID tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13332)|
| 3:42:15| The doors have locks and alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| And our kids have drills for every horrible scenario imaginable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13337)|
| 3:42:22| So why can't we make their schools safe from protest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| They are children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13345)|
| 3:42:27| They cannot vote, and they don't have a say in our political process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13347)|
| 3:42:31| They just want to learn and have fun with their friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13351)|
| 3:42:34| Instead, they are learning by your actions and your inactions that bullying is actually okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13354)|
| 3:42:40| As long as it is a parent who is walking their child to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13360)|
| 3:42:45| It doesn't matter how they feel about it, because they are just kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13365)|
| 3:42:49| School zones should not be protest zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13369)|
| 3:42:52| Please put a policy in place that does not allow protests at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13372)|
| 3:42:58| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13378)|
| 3:43:00| Skylar Grubin and then Brent Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13380)|
| 3:43:11| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13391)|
| 3:43:15| Hi, my name is Skylar Grubin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13395)|
| 3:43:17| I live in Knox County, and I am a student at Farragut Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13397)|
| 3:43:21| I am here to talk about the anti-mask protests that are happening every day at my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13401)|
| 3:43:26| My sister drives me to school, and I walk from the high school parking lot to the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13406)|
| 3:43:31| For over a week, I have had to be on my phone or with my mom as I walk past the protesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13411)|
| 3:43:36| There are about 40 people, some with kids and many without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13416)|
| 3:43:40| They crowd together and walk on school property and stand by the office entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13420)|
| 3:43:45| They have even gotten to the point where they are standing in front of the student entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13425)|
| 3:43:50| and I have no choice but to walk next to them to get inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13430)|
| 3:43:54| It is terrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13434)|
| 3:43:56| The police officers just stand there with the doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13436)|
| 3:43:59| They don't make me feel safe, even though that is their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13439)|
| 3:44:02| As a kid, when the protesters hold up their signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13442)|
| 3:44:04| I know I can't do anything, and I know I have no power over the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13444)|
| 3:44:09| I feel scared because I feel as if I am going to be hurt physically by them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13449)|
| 3:44:16| or that they are going to yell at me or radio at me without my permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13456)|
| 3:44:20| These protesters make me and my friends feel uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13460)|
| 3:44:24| After I walk through the school doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13464)|
| 3:44:27| my nerves from seeing the protesters cause me to feel shaky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13467)|
| 3:44:33| and it sometimes takes me the whole first period to calm down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13473)|
| 3:44:37| They hold up signs like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13477)|
| 3:44:39| good little sheep, wear their mask, and save your mask for Halloween.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13479)|
| 3:44:42| These signs make me feel frustrated because they are comparing us to animals that are simple-minded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13482)|
| 3:44:48| and they are assuming that we aren't able to think for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13488)|
| 3:44:51| I also feel like this is dividing our school because it is in our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13491)|
| 3:44:55| It is dividing our school because it is in our face every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13495)|
| 3:44:58| whether you are pro-mask or anti-mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13498)|
| 3:45:01| which is frustrating because I just want to have a peaceful day at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13501)|
| 3:45:04| and not have to worry about my safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13504)|
| 3:45:06| Will I ever feel safe at my school again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13506)|
| 3:45:09| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13511)|
| 3:45:14| Brent Hunter and then Matthew Perkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13514)|
| 3:45:25| My name is Brent Hunter. I am a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13525)|
| 3:45:29| I have seven kids. Five are in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| I have three at Brickey Elementary where they have been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13534)|
| 3:45:37| even though they have said no, they are told they have got to absolutely wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13537)|
| 3:45:42| I have got two at Powell High School who have been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13542)|
| 3:45:45| that they will be suspended if they do not wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13545)|
| 3:45:48| In case you didn't know, I absolutely object against this unconstitutional mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13548)|
| 3:45:53| and the segregation of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| You say that your hands are tied with this mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13556)|
| 3:46:01| You feel that you have to comply, but please know that we do not have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13561)|
| 3:46:07| You say something has to be done about students who don't want to comply to wear these masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13567)|
| 3:46:13| You say they need to be separated, segregated from their classmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13573)|
| 3:46:18| But can someone please answer this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13578)|
| 3:46:21| Why are students being denied an education and instruction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13581)|
| 3:46:26| Why are students not being allowed to ask anyone questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13586)|
| 3:46:31| They are stuck in an isolated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| They have been given busy work and pretty much told to sit down and shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13593)|
| 3:46:38| You say that some sort of discipline is in order for noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13598)|
| 3:46:42| So what can that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13602)|
| 3:46:44| Examples could be cutting out the students' extracurricular activities like sports and clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13604)|
| 3:46:50| If scholarships are on the line, maybe that would persuade student athletes to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13610)|
| 3:46:55| Or maybe there are field trips coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13615)|
| 3:46:58| Trips to the zoo, trips to concerts, or trips to any other special place for these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13618)|
| 3:47:03| Those that don't comply cannot attend these activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13623)|
| 3:47:07| Or any special activities at the school like safety patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13627)|
| 3:47:11| But hear me when I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13631)|
| 3:47:13| What cannot happen is any Knox County school going against Article 11, Section 12 of the Tennessee Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13633)|
| 3:47:21| by denying these kids their right to free education, void of discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13641)|
| 3:47:26| What is the board going to do to ensure that the right of an education for noncompliant students is not being denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13646)|
| 3:47:35| If a student shows up wanting an education, they are to be counted present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13655)|
| 3:47:40| and given the opportunity to learn just like every other child there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13660)|
| 3:47:45| And I will close in saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13665)|
| 3:47:47| I am asking this board to vote to stand strong, act in civil disobedience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13667)|
| 3:47:53| and reject the ruling given by Judge Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13673)|
| 3:47:58| If all of us are willing to fight for these students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13678)|
| 3:48:01| it's about time that you show you're willing to do the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13681)|
| 3:48:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13685)|
| 3:48:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13686)|
| 3:48:11| Matthew Perkins, Indian, Adam Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13691)|
| 3:48:24| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13704)|
| 3:48:26| Matthew Perkins, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13706)|
| 3:48:28| It's been some great speeches tonight, so I don't have too much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13708)|
| 3:48:31| I just want to put it on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| What's going on and deteriorating in the schools rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13713)|
| 3:48:36| My son, a very obedient child, does not want to wear a mask, suffers from anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13716)|
| 3:48:42| Luckily, he got it from mom and dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13722)|
| 3:48:44| And the teachers are starting to ratchet up the pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13724)|
| 3:48:48| That's uncalled for, unnecessary, unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13728)|
| 3:48:52| My daughter, by the way, born 12 weeks early, premature, grade 4 brain bleed for any doctors in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13732)|
| 3:49:00| All accounts, she shouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13740)|
| 3:49:03| She's here, alive and kicking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13743)|
| 3:49:04| She loves school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13744)|
| 3:49:06| I got to go home now and try to console her because there's pictures being posted of Spirit Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13746)|
| 3:49:12| whatever it was, the day in fourth grade where students were taking pictures with their t-shirts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13752)|
| 3:49:17| Not even a message to her, because she's in isolation, about the opportunity to maybe comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13757)|
| 3:49:24| wear a mask so she can get that picture taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13764)|
| 3:49:26| But instead, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13766)|
| 3:49:28| And I have another picture of another fourth grade class where they all have their masks off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13768)|
| 3:49:32| So what's the deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13772)|
| 3:49:34| It's getting really tiring to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13774)|
| 3:49:37| I actually moved my family down from Illinois where we led a very fantastic life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13777)|
| 3:49:41| but very under the thumb of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13781)|
| 3:49:44| And I thought about, we followed the school district here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13784)|
| 3:49:47| We followed them for a year before we made this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13787)|
| 3:49:50| And we came down here for a better life, for freedom of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13790)|
| 3:49:54| And that choice has been taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13794)|
| 3:49:56| Fortunately, I'm in a position where I can take them out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| So I believe there's a financial benefit for me keeping the kids in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13798)|
| 3:50:03| from my understanding and my limited reading I've done so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13803)|
| 3:50:06| But I'll be more than happy to take them out of Knox County School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13806)|
| 3:50:11| No qualms at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13811)|
| 3:50:13| There's homeschooling that is coming up as being a great option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13813)|
| 3:50:16| There's also a lot of private schools with no mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13816)|
| 3:50:19| So I'm here to fight verbally right now with everybody else who says this is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13819)|
| 3:50:24| But I'll throw in that towel and I'll put my kids in private school in a heartbeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13824)|
| 3:50:28| So start making some decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13828)|
| 3:50:30| They might be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13830)|
| 3:50:32| They might be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13832)|
| 3:50:34| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13834)|
| 3:50:36| This is freedom here and we are hurting our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13836)|
| 3:50:38| End of story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13838)|
| 3:50:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13840)|
| 3:50:42| Adam Miller and then Jennifer Quinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13842)|
| 3:50:55| My name is Adam Miller, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13855)|
| 3:51:01| I came here with three really, really full minutes of stuff typed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13861)|
| 3:51:07| about why I believe that this injunction is illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13867)|
| 3:51:11| and it is a violation of federal law per the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13871)|
| 3:51:15| And other people have discussed some of those things tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13875)|
| 3:51:20| I've decided to switch gears and I'm not going to get into all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13880)|
| 3:51:24| First of all, all of you make me proud to be a Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13884)|
| 3:51:30| Thank you for all of your stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13890)|
| 3:51:32| And thank you for standing up for liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13892)|
| 3:51:35| Thank all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13895)|
| 3:51:38| I also moved here recently this year from the West Coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13898)|
| 3:51:44| I grew up in North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13904)|
| 3:51:46| But I moved back for many of the same reasons I've heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13906)|
| 3:51:49| Specifically to East Tennessee because I believe that liberty is valued here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13909)|
| 3:51:56| and that the Constitution is valued here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13916)|
| 3:51:59| And I wanted to get my family back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13919)|
| 3:52:02| And we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13922)|
| 3:52:04| I have a kindergartner in Farragut Primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13924)|
| 3:52:07| I walked in to a parent orientation and was very, very proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13927)|
| 3:52:12| to see in God we trust on the wall right there, fearlessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13932)|
| 3:52:18| And that they start their day with the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13938)|
| 3:52:23| That doesn't happen everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13943)|
| 3:52:25| Thank you for that, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| It's heartbreaking now to walk up to that school every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13947)|
| 3:52:33| and see small children with their faces covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13953)|
| 3:52:36| And it does impact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13956)|
| 3:52:38| And it will impact them for their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13958)|
| 3:52:41| Some of the things I had typed out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13961)|
| 3:52:43| are numerous psychology studies that spend decades of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13963)|
| 3:52:50| very unambiguously stating that children do need to read people's facial expressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13970)|
| 3:52:59| It's critical for healthy social and emotional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13979)|
| 3:53:03| and you're depriving children for their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13983)|
| 3:53:06| I would like to also state right now that I will respect your wishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13986)|
| 3:53:10| as a board to not address any of you personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13990)|
| 3:53:15| But I want to tell you as a board that one of you are being extremely rude right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=13995)|
| 3:53:22| staring at nothing but your lap while people stand up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14002)|
| 3:53:26| and pour their hearts out about their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14006)|
| 3:53:29| How dare you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14009)|
| 3:53:31| How dare you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14011)|
| 3:53:32| How dare you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14012)|
| 3:53:37| What I wanted to say before I left is I would request you as the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14017)|
| 3:53:44| please provide us as parents and as citizens a place we can go to access information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14024)|
| 3:53:50| I think a lot of us may feel isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14030)|
| 3:53:52| I think that we would really appreciate it as citizens of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14032)|
| 3:53:56| to have a place on the board website where we can go see what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14036)|
| 3:54:00| where you're going with this and how you're fighting for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14040)|
| 3:54:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14043)|
| 3:54:08| Jennifer Quinley and then Amanda Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14048)|
| 3:54:12| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14052)|
| 3:54:15| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| My name is Jennifer Quinley and I'm a Knox County parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14057)|
| 3:54:20| I'm also a physician and I've been an advocate for masks all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14060)|
| 3:54:25| However, I've heard so many valid stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14065)|
| 3:54:29| that definitely have softened my opinion toward that tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14069)|
| 3:54:33| because above all I am an American and I do believe in certain liberties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14073)|
| 3:54:38| and I believe that our country is a great country and it's built on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14078)|
| 3:54:42| And right now you all are in an impossible situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14082)|
| 3:54:45| because you're expected to comply with a federal judge's order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14085)|
| 3:54:49| that is very narrow in scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14089)|
| 3:54:51| I will admit that as a physician it's very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14091)|
| 3:54:54| Because if you don't you'll be in contempt of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14094)|
| 3:54:57| However, you have families and I think all of us are in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14097)|
| 3:55:01| because we care deeply about our country, we care deeply about our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14101)|
| 3:55:05| and hearing stories where there is selective enforcement of these policies is not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14105)|
| 3:55:11| Children should never be intimidated or bullied by any grown adult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14111)|
| 3:55:17| either a protester or by a person in a position of authority in their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14117)|
| 3:55:22| So, I come to you tonight after having attended the funeral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14122)|
| 3:55:28| of a friend's son who died of COVID and he was a victim of misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14128)|
| 3:55:33| So, he was 36 and he has left behind a grieving little boy who has lost his father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14133)|
| 3:55:41| And again, it's an impossible situation because no one knows what to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14141)|
| 3:55:47| However, when new scientific evidence is generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14147)|
| 3:55:51| I have an obligation, I as a physician have an obligation to review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14151)|
| 3:55:55| without bias and educate myself about its relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14155)|
| 3:55:59| And I think if you're in a position of leadership you need to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14159)|
| 3:56:03| There have been some studies saying that masks can mitigate transmission within schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14163)|
| 3:56:08| And keep in mind a lot of this data could not have been effectively generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14168)|
| 3:56:13| because either at some point kids were not in person instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14173)|
| 3:56:17| or we didn't have the Delta variant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14177)|
| 3:56:18| But when you look at this fall in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14178)|
| 3:56:22| there have been studies that showed that 8.4% of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14182)|
| 3:56:27| of the outbreaks that were in schools with early like from the gate requirements for masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14187)|
| 3:56:32| that were 8.4%, I can't even talk, 8.4% of the outbreaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14192)|
| 3:56:37| whereas 56% of the outbreaks occurred in schools that had no mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14197)|
| 3:56:42| So, there's clearly a difference in how it can mitigate transmission of the disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14202)|
| 3:56:47| Schools without mask requirements were 3.5 times more likely to have outbreaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14207)|
| 3:56:53| compared to schools with requirements when they looked at confounding variables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14213)|
| 3:56:57| in a separate study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14217)|
| 3:56:59| And certainly within the first 8 weeks of school, Tennessee was in the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14219)|
| 3:57:03| We led the country in outbreaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14223)|
| 3:57:06| And it's just not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14226)|
| 3:57:08| Schools do have the right to restrict behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14228)|
| 3:57:11| That has a legal precedent to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14231)|
| 3:57:12| Liberty cannot be restricted except in certain situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14232)|
| 3:57:17| where there's endangering other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14237)|
| 3:57:19| And so, even our founding fathers listed life before liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14239)|
| 3:57:23| when they did the declaration of independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14243)|
| 3:57:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14246)|
| 3:57:28| Amanda Collins and Linda Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14248)|
| 3:57:35| Is Ms. Collins here? Amanda Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14255)|
| 3:57:38| Linda Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14258)|
| 3:57:42| Lisa Moon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14262)|
| 3:57:49| Kim Sprague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14269)|
| 3:57:56| Randy Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14276)|
| 3:58:03| Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14283)|
| 3:58:07| Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14287)|
| 3:58:10| So, Randy Jones and then Patty King and then Paul Hibben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14290)|
| 3:58:26| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14306)|
| 3:58:28| Hi, my name is Randy Jones and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14308)|
| 3:58:32| I have a junior at Farragut and I am the grandmother of Alec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14312)|
| 3:58:41| So, I believe that everyone, I'm a nurse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14321)|
| 3:58:46| and I believe that everyone that can wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14326)|
| 3:58:49| should wear a mask to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14329)|
| 3:58:51| although I do believe that schools have to uphold exemptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14331)|
| 3:58:55| for those that are unable to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14335)|
| 3:58:57| And I can tell you that Caitlin and I disagree on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14337)|
| 3:59:01| and there have been some very heated discussions between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14341)|
| 3:59:05| Over the last few weeks, or over the last week and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14345)|
| 3:59:09| we have been asked several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14349)|
| 3:59:11| why Alec just doesn't stay home and be homeschooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14351)|
| 3:59:13| And the answer to that is because of Alec's learning disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14353)|
| 3:59:17| homeschooling is not what is in his best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14357)|
| 3:59:20| His IEP team has determined that his learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14360)|
| 3:59:23| needs to be done in a classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14363)|
| 3:59:25| because right now what he needs to learn is how to be a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14365)|
| 3:59:28| He's not ready to learn how to write his name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14368)|
| 3:59:31| or that 1 plus 1 equals 2 like a traditional student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14371)|
| 3:59:34| He needs to learn how to sit at a desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14374)|
| 3:59:36| listen to teachers, and interact with his peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14376)|
| 3:59:39| Those are the goals that his IEP set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14379)|
| 3:59:42| team set up, and for him those can't be learned virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14382)|
| 3:59:46| But we are not just here to talk about Alec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14386)|
| 3:59:49| there are other students like him that need to be in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14389)|
| 3:59:53| Caitlin also brought up the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14393)|
| 3:59:56| that these students' IEPs are federally protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14396)|
| 3:59:59| and right now they are not being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14399)|
| 4:00:01| So I ask, on one hand you've got the judge's mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14401)|
| 4:00:06| that in essence is preventing these students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14406)|
| 4:00:09| from going to school, therefore violating their IEPs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14409)|
| 4:00:13| and on the other hand the federal law protecting their IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14413)|
| 4:00:17| How is it that you choose, that you're choosing one to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14417)|
| 4:00:22| So if not following either of them are violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14422)|
| 4:00:25| and one excludes students and one improves students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14425)|
| 4:00:28| why not pick the one that is better for the students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14428)|
| 4:00:31| The one that's better for the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14431)|
| 4:00:34| that you're supposed to be serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14434)|
| 4:00:36| Since you have a choice, why not choose the children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14436)|
| 4:00:39| I don't discount that you're in an impossible situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14439)|
| 4:00:43| I don't ignore the fact that you are dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14443)|
| 4:00:45| with educational needs for 60,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14445)|
| 4:00:48| I don't know the number of how many of those students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14448)|
| 4:00:51| have a learning or mental disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14451)|
| 4:00:54| I'm going to throw out a number, I'd say 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14454)|
| 4:00:58| Or 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14458)|
| 4:01:02| So in the grand scheme of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14462)|
| 4:01:04| we're talking about choosing what's best for 55,000 over five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14464)|
| 4:01:07| So then ultimately what are we asking you to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14467)|
| 4:01:11| We're asking you to immediately follow last year's mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14471)|
| 4:01:15| with the exemption clause that you used then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14475)|
| 4:01:18| or even adopt the exemption clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14478)|
| 4:01:20| that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14480)|
| 4:01:22| in their response letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14482)|
| 4:01:24| Something that will allow the students that are unable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14484)|
| 4:01:25| or will not wear a mask because of a disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14485)|
| 4:01:30| to attend classes and follow their IEPs as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14490)|
| 4:01:33| All we're asking is that you start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14493)|
| 4:01:36| leaving those behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14496)|
| 4:01:39| not leaving those children like Alec behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14499)|
| 4:01:42| but forgetting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14502)|
| 4:01:44| Patty King and then Paul Hibben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14504)|
| 4:01:51| Hi, please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14511)|
| 4:01:54| Patty King, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14514)|
| 4:01:56| I was going to address the isolation rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14516)|
| 4:01:58| but something has just come to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14518)|
| 4:02:01| that has totally pissed me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14521)|
| 4:02:03| One of the students that spoke here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14523)|
| 4:02:06| has been called in one of the other groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14526)|
| 4:02:09| an entitled brat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| This is bullying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| We need to end all the bullying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14533)|
| 4:02:16| The other side is saying that we're bullying these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14536)|
| 4:02:19| We are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14539)|
| 4:02:21| We are peacefully protesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14541)|
| 4:02:23| A mask mandate that should not be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14543)|
| 4:02:26| It's not right for our students to have to choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14546)|
| 4:02:30| to leave school or be in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14550)|
| 4:02:35| These kids have the right to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14555)|
| 4:02:38| As many of you know, I am a small business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14558)|
| 4:02:41| that teaches music privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14561)|
| 4:02:43| These kids are my students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14563)|
| 4:02:46| my husband's students, another teacher's students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14566)|
| 4:02:49| These kids have come to these lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14569)|
| 4:02:51| We're virtual right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14571)|
| 4:02:53| but they've been virtually crying to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14573)|
| 4:02:57| because they are not getting the education they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14577)|
| 4:03:01| These parents are crying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14581)|
| 4:03:03| because they're not getting the education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14583)|
| 4:03:05| We've got so many parents pulling kids out to homeschool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14585)|
| 4:03:08| in my group that I'm part of, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14588)|
| 4:03:11| because of this mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14591)|
| 4:03:13| This mandate, yes, I know you guys have no say over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14593)|
| 4:03:16| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14596)|
| 4:03:18| But you do have say in what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14598)|
| 4:03:19| in these isolation rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| These students are not getting work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14601)|
| 4:03:23| They're being threatened to be arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| at South Doyle High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14605)|
| 4:03:27| Come on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14607)|
| 4:03:29| That needs to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14609)|
| 4:03:31| That needs to stop, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14611)|
| 4:03:33| These kids are fighting for their freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14613)|
| 4:03:36| their freedom that has been promised to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14616)|
| 4:03:39| by our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14619)|
| 4:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14621)|
| 4:03:43| Paul Hibben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14623)|
| 4:03:56| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14636)|
| 4:03:59| My name is Paul Hibben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14639)|
| 4:04:01| I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14641)|
| 4:04:03| I have children in the Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14643)|
| 4:04:05| I'd like to start by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14645)|
| 4:04:07| I appreciate the governor and the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14647)|
| 4:04:09| for at least giving us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14649)|
| 4:04:10| or attempting to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14650)|
| 4:04:12| the right to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14652)|
| 4:04:14| This federal judge's mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14654)|
| 4:04:16| is now causing irreparable harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14656)|
| 4:04:18| to a litany of other students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14658)|
| 4:04:20| with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14660)|
| 4:04:22| which is direct violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14662)|
| 4:04:24| of the American with Disabilities Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14664)|
| 4:04:26| This lawsuit and decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14666)|
| 4:04:28| was nothing more than a ploy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14668)|
| 4:04:30| by the plaintiffs who only care about themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14670)|
| 4:04:32| and their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14672)|
| 4:04:34| with their disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14674)|
| 4:04:36| It is clear because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14676)|
| 4:04:37| no other disabilities are included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14677)|
| 4:04:40| And if that's not unlawful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14680)|
| 4:04:42| I don't know what is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14682)|
| 4:04:44| And you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14684)|
| 4:04:46| It's an unlawful catch-22 situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14686)|
| 4:04:49| that this judge has put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14689)|
| 4:04:51| the Board of Education in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14691)|
| 4:04:54| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14694)|
| 4:04:57| You cannot comply with the mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14697)|
| 4:04:59| and comply with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14699)|
| 4:05:01| American with Disabilities Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14701)|
| 4:05:03| It's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14703)|
| 4:05:05| And you all know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14705)|
| 4:05:07| That's what we're all here about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14707)|
| 4:05:09| So why don't you do something about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14709)|
| 4:05:11| Stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14711)|
| 4:05:16| Stand up and tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14716)|
| 4:05:18| this is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14718)|
| 4:05:20| We cannot do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14720)|
| 4:05:22| So why are you choosing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14722)|
| 4:05:24| She just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14724)|
| 4:05:26| you've got to choose one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14726)|
| 4:05:28| Why are you choosing the judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14728)|
| 4:05:30| It took Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14730)|
| 4:05:32| an entire Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14732)|
| 4:05:34| to pass the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14734)|
| 4:05:35| I'm not telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14735)|
| 4:05:37| what he thinks you should use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14737)|
| 4:05:39| out of the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14739)|
| 4:05:41| It's horse pokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14741)|
| 4:05:43| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14743)|
| 4:05:45| And I think everybody here knows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14745)|
| 4:05:47| So I implore you to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14747)|
| 4:05:49| Do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14749)|
| 4:05:53| Somebody step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=14753)|
