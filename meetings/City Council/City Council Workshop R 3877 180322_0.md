| 0:01:54| I appreciate all of you coming this evening and hope that we can give you some information about the Community Development Department as well as our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=114)|
| 0:02:03| I want to take a moment just to introduce the staff that's with me here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| Linda Russ is our Community Development Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Ken McMahon is our Economic Development Project Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| And we have our intern, Lee Tatum, with us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| So just to start off, you know, Knoxville's changing, and community development is a big part of all the changes that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=140)|
| 0:02:30| These are some examples of our work, recent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| This is a commercial façade improvement project on Broadway, Elkmont Exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| And there's some statistics there about what that created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| It was a $76,000 commercial façade improvement loan, but it leveraged $2.1 million in private investment, created 130 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=162)|
| 0:02:54| So with that one project, you can see the impact that had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| It took a formerly vacant building and created that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| Honey Bee Coffee on Sevier Avenue, also a commercial façade improvement project, $50,000 in city dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| leveraged $313,000 in private investment, 25 new jobs, and created two residential units above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=192)|
| 0:03:25| New businesses are also providing jobs in our redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| Here's the Mill and Mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| That's another commercial façade improvement project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| I'm sure you all have been there or will go there this weekend maybe for big ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| But that was $100,000 in commercial façade improvement funds, leveraged $1.5 million in private investment, created 25 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=220)|
| 0:03:51| Also, back over in South Knoxville, Three Bears Coffee and Alliance Brewing on Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| That was a $50,000 commercial façade investment that leveraged $500,000 in private investment, created 16 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=238)|
| 0:04:10| So we also do commercial façade improvements on existing businesses, and this is one on Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| This is Computer Systems Plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| It was done a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| That was a $40,000 façade improvement that made that building really, really look so much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=261)|
| 0:04:29| It helped them to retain the 17 jobs that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| And then Advanced Metals on Davenport, complete makeover there, $50,000 façade loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=274)|
| 0:04:43| That leveraged $40,000 in private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| Likewise, our historic preservation grants are doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| We have a lot underway right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| We've completed some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| There's an example of one that was completed, Kearns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| I know you all have read and heard about what's coming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| That was a $150,000 investment from the Historic Preservation Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=303)|
| 0:05:12| That leveraged $6.3 million in private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| And Baker Creek Bottoms, that was one building was awarded last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| Another building was awarded this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| That first building was $300,000 in Historic Preservation Funds, and that leveraged $6.4 million in private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=324)|
| 0:05:35| The Chronic Problem Properties also has seen some major turnarounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| This is going to be one of our big success stories soon, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| But this was an extremely blighted property, a historic school that had held a lot of value for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| The city did acquire that through the Chronic Problem Property Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| We resold it through an RFP, and it is now being developed as 60 units of assisted living for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=358)|
| 0:06:08| The planned expenditures of private funds on that building will be well over $9.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=368)|
| 0:06:18| And then we have new opportunities for houses to be rehabbed on vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| These three on the top are examples of before pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| The one in the middle was a vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| The one on the right is a severely blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| We know you know about that one, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| But all three are the bottom pictures, and that's what can happen when we take a step in, acquire a blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| and then get that in the right hands to turn that property around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| And then we're also revitalizing whole neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| This is the Five Points revitalization that's going on through KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| The city's currently invested $9 million in that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| and that's for the public infrastructure that goes along with the housing that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| At the end of this project, after all four phases are completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| we'll have 460 new units of affordable housing there on the former Walter P. Taylor Homes site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=435)|
| 0:07:25| including new streets, sidewalks, lighting, public amenities such as parks, trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| and just a very livable, much better environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| So just to talk about our city resources, and this is not our federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| but we in community development manage several different funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| We manage capital funds, city operating funds, as well as our federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| So to list the capital fund projects, that's the Commercial Facade Improvement Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| blighted property and chronic problem property acquisitions, ADA facility improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| and the Five Points redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| In our general operating funds, we have our historic preservation grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| We fund the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| Some other grant programs include the East Tennessee Quality Growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| our Disability Services Office, Great Schools Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| the Office on Homelessness, and homeless agency grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| We also provide affordable housing trust fund dollars to the East Tennessee Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| as well as our new affordable rental development fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| and that's the $2 million that council approved last year that we're working through right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=525)|
| 0:08:56| Did I miss homemakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Well, it's not really a funding mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Okay, so just to get a little more detail about the programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| commercial facade improvement applications are submitted to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| They're reviewed by a committee and scored and ranked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| and the evaluation criteria include the number of jobs that will be created or retained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| the new businesses that will be created, the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| Is it in a redevelopment area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| Is it an area that needs some city assistance as it is growing and needs that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| The condition of the building, is it vacant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Is it in a blighted situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| And then the leverage investment by the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| The results of the project, you've seen lots of the money that's been leveraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| but it also increases the property tax revenue for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| sales tax revenue, and private sector investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| There's another example of one that's in South Knoxville, Sonotaco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| and that was a $50,000 facade grant that leveraged $650,000 in private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| So in 2017, the city's investment of $342,000 resulted in seven projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| over $1.2 million in private investment, 183 new jobs, 11 jobs retained, and three new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=626)|
| 0:10:38| Another program that is completed, just to keep you informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| is this HUD Section 108 loan that was made to the Farragut Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| That is a HUD program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| The city applied for that loan in September of 2015, and we were awarded in March of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| That money was relent to Dover Development to help with the rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| of the Farragut Hotel building, specifically for job creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| It is a 20-year term, low-interest loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| The developer is paying the city back, and the city then repays HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| Sixty-five full-time equivalent jobs have been created so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| We've met our goal, and it leveraged over $25 million in private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=683)|
| 0:11:33| Blighted property acquisition and chronic problem property acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| are tools we have to acquire property, and then we dispose of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| or sell those through our Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Here are some examples of properties that we've acquired that we will resell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=705)|
| 0:11:53| On the bottom, this is an example of some lots that we sold through Homemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| They're in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| The purchaser has built two new affordable rental houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| So for Homemakers, we sell lots, vacant lots that the city owns or has acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| We also sell structures that we've acquired through our blighted property process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=735)|
| 0:12:23| and they are for sale for individuals, developers, or nonprofit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| We give extra credit for affordable housing as the result of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=749)|
| 0:12:37| Another tool that we use for affordable housing are the pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| or payments in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Any low-income housing tax credit project that's receiving those credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| for rehabilitation or new construction can request a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| This is a letter that goes from the mayor to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| and it basically freezes the taxes for the term of the affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| in order to help on the operating side so that the cost to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| and keep those rents affordable is more easily met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| So far, we've had seven affordable housing developments receive pilots since 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| and that amounts to 767 units of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| So our new program is the Affordable Rental Development Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| You all have approved two projects so far, Restoration House and Helen Ross McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| On your agenda next week will be another request, and that's for Southside Flats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| and that's the South Knoxville development, which will be 172 units of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=828)|
| 0:14:01| Yeah, I've got a different slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| I've got affordable housing resources in a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| Yeah, I can jump to this since this is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| So also within the community development department is our office on homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=855)|
| 0:14:23| and we coordinate the continuum of care for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| Those are grants that come directly to agencies from HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| and we submit that application on behalf of those agencies every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| That's about $1.2 million in dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| They don't come to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| They go directly to those agencies, but we do coordinate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| We also manage case management projects for Flinnican and Villa and KCDC Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Yeah, Becky, you're probably aware that in a couple of weeks, April the 5th, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| we're having a workshop on homelessness, which the mayor will lead with Mike's assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| Yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| So you'll hear lots more about homelessness and the programs that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| Then we also help to cover the cost of the HMIS system that UT Swarps Program manages for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=910)|
| 0:15:19| and that's the HMIS plus the coordinated entry system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| which is a new HUD-required system that all agencies that serve homeless individuals participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| It's kind of to rank a priority need for each individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| so that those with the greatest need get the services first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| And then we have general operating funds that serve homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Those fund a number of different grants at different agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| whether it's transitional housing, homeless prevention, street outreach, emergency shelter services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| And those agencies vary from VMC to YWCA to Salvation Army,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| and we implement those contracts with those agencies and then monitor their progress throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=966)|
| 0:16:16| We also get state emergency solution grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| These are federal dollars that come through the state of Tennessee to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| Our allocation for the coming year is $161,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| I believe it was on your last council agenda that you approved submission of that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| And the awards will go to CAC for rapid rehousing funds and volunteer ministry center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=994)|
| 0:16:44| So there's just some logos of agencies that we work with through our homeless office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1004)|
| 0:16:54| So here's our affordable housing resources as they stand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| The Affordable Housing Trust Fund I mentioned that goes to the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| Our Homemakers Program, that's where we sell properties to create affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| The Affordable Rental Development Program, that's the new $2 million fund, and our pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| Also programs that help keep housing affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| The KEEM program that ended is now continuing on with Round It Up through KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| And I'm not sure what the Healthy Homes Initiative is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| It's something new coming this year, so you'll hear more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| Healthy Homes in HUD lingo typically means some kind of abatement for mold, moisture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| lead, any substances within a home that can create an unsafe environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| And then from HUD, the city, we had a lead hazard control grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| and we're reapplying this year for another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Our last one was for $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| We're reapplying again just as soon as the notice of funding availability comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| And then we get our community planning and development programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| So those are the funds, HUD funds, CDBG and HOME, that are governed by our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1094)|
| 0:18:26| Community development block grants have criteria, of course, of who they can serve and how they can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| They're focused on low-to-moderate income households, persons, low-to-moderate income areas or neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1114)|
| 0:18:43| They can be used for remediation of slum or blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| They can be used for an urgent need, which is typically only a disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| and they can be used for public services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| Our HOME funds, Home Investment Partnership Program funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| are only targeted to affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| And then the emergency solutions grants, I just talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| They come to us through the state, and they are focused on homeless activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| So those are the three pots of money that the city has in community development that are federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| that we use for our services and projects that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| and how we're going to spend that is laid out in our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1169)|
| 0:19:38| So it's hard to see this, I know, but if you look at the lines, you can see that they're going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| This just illustrates how our federal funds have decreased over the last eight years, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| That's since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| The top line on the right, the blue line, that is CDBG, and the red or orange line is the HOME.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1194)|
| 0:20:05| And then at the very bottom, that's the ESG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| And then it completely stopped as a direct allocation in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| And the city has helped pick up with those homeless grants at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| And the large green bar illustrates the Affordable Housing Fund, the $2 million that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| So you can see we're sort of back to where we were in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| But not all the way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| There is some good news that we got today about the budget for 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| The Omnibus Bill has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| It looks like community development block grant will be increased by 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| and our HOME funds will be increased by around 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| We don't know yet what that's going to translate as far as dollars to us, but that's very good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| And we feel like it was part of the tax bill deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| and that's how those funds were able to go up for this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1263)|
| 0:21:13| So those funds are governed by our consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| This is a big plan that we do every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| Last time we did it was in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| It involves extensive community participation, focus groups, talking to many citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| We did a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| We look at data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| There's a lot of activity when we do a consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Our next one, of course, will be in 2020, and we'll start working on that in the fall of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| So look for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| We'll be doing lots of meetings and asking for a lot of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| But what the consolidated plan does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| it sets the priorities for our funding activities for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| Each year it's updated annually, and that's called the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| And it gives us the opportunity to look at community needs and new opportunities and challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| funding sources, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| so that we can make adjustments to our consolidated plan through our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1329)|
| 0:22:18| Once again, it requires citizen participation and consultation with our community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| We started with a meeting, public meeting, in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| We will have another public meeting in April, May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| We will consider this a consultation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Anytime we talk to any group about the annual action plan, we take comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| and all of that is included in our plan that goes to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| We report our accomplishments every year in the fall, and that report is called the CAPER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1367)|
| 0:22:56| And so each one of these plans and reports, you can find them on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| but in the spring we tell HUD how we're going to spend our federal money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| and then in the fall we tell HUD what we did with the money we got with the year that just ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| So we lay out goals and objectives in our annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| and then we report our accomplishments at the end of that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| So we are held accountable on a regular basis for the federal money that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| This annual action plan year starts in July 2018, just like the fiscal budget does for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| and it goes through June 30, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| So our five-year priorities that were established in 2015 are just strengthen neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| promote economic development, reduce and end homelessness, and promote affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| And we do that through a number of projects and activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Our consolidated plan priorities haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| We have focused more now on affordable housing because there's a real need for rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| so we've really, you can see, put a lot more funding into that and energy into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| but our priorities have stayed the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| So for affordable rental housing, we have several programs that we work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| There's a weatherization program through CAC, accessibility improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| We work with CAC and neighborhood housing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Rehab, we do that in-house, and we also work with CAC on repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1479)|
| 0:24:48| Development of new construction, that's funded with home money, and rehab as well is funded with home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| And then if we were to develop any permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| which we're very interested in doing, that would be paid for with our home funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| For our owner-occupied housing, we do emergency and minor home repairs, whole house rehabilitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1506)|
| 0:25:17| We fund our community housing development organizations to build new affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| and we assist with down payment assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| And for our public services, we have a workforce development project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| that we're working with the Leadership Foundation on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| and we provide design and technical assistance through the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1534)|
| 0:25:44| Just to get a little more in-depth on this, how do we keep housing affordable for households?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| First and foremost, we reduce their housing costs, and we do this through lowering their utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| This is done through the Round It Up and through our CAC weatherization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| If your utility costs are less, it's more affordable to stay in your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| and we certainly want to keep anyone who's in a home in that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| We also assist people with emergency home repairs and minor home repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Those are done by a couple of agencies, like I said, CAC and Neighborhood Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| Once we get our lead grant, we can remediate lead paint, and we also improve accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1588)|
| 0:26:38| We also have a rental rehab program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| We work to stabilize current rental units so that they will continue to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| Once you receive funds from us for rental rehab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| you're required to keep a unit affordable for a number of years based on the amount of money you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| But this helps to have good quality rental housing and continue that stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1619)|
| 0:27:08| This is Normandy Chateau, a project that HomeSource did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| And then this one at the bottom is on Pocahontas Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| We're working with them now to do rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| And then Premier Properties on the bottom right, that's on Valley View, that's 40 units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| So they're all receiving funds through our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Those are federal dollars to do rehabilitation to keep those affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| And then we also use our home funds to develop new affordable rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| The village at Holston Court, that's 38 units on Holston Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| HomeSource is working on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| And then the Southside Flats that we talked about before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| they are also receiving not just the city funds but our home funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| We're providing a large grant of home funds to them to help fill the gap for the creation of that 172 affordable units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1680)|
| 0:28:13| In the past, we've supported permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| We would like to do a project like that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| This is Flanagan Landing and Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| Both of those projects received federal funds from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| in the form of community development block grant and home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| And at the time, we had Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| That was a separate HUD program that we were able to put into those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1717)|
| 0:28:47| Maintaining the supply of affordable owner-occupied housing is one of our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| We have an in-house team that works with homeowners to get their houses rehabilitated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1732)|
| 0:29:00| We help them find a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| We pay for relocation while the work is being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| And then they repay us the loan over 20 years for those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| And so that provides us program income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| but it also provides a way for a lower-income homeowner who can't get bank financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| to get their home brought up to code, not a makeover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| but the house is brought up to code and standard and keeps that affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| We provide energy-efficient upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| and then that family can continue to live in that house for a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1774)|
| 0:29:43| And like I mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| we work with our community housing development agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| to build new affordable for-sale housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| These are some examples of a couple of different houses in different neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| and that's Neighborhood Housing and East Tennessee Housing Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| and HomeSource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Those are three agencies that we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| We offer down payment assistance for anybody buying a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| that is built by one of our CHOTOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| So up to 15% of our CDBG grant can be used on public service activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1816)|
| 0:30:25| and the two that I mentioned were workforce development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| and the design and technical assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and we plan to continue those projects in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1832)|
| 0:30:43| So just to talk about the appropriations, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| Congress has to appropriate the money to the city of Knoxville every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| We have a formula that we're supposed to receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| but we have not received our full formula amount since I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| because every year the funds have to be appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| So we're battling with all the other agencies that are trying to get federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| So there is a process that it goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| Right now, we have not received our level of funding yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| They've just approved the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| So in order to submit this plan in a timely way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| we have to proceed with our public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| So this is what we're doing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| and what we're laying out is how we will spend the money once we get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| even though we don't know the actual amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| So we are letting everybody know that proportionately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| based on what we think we're going to get, this is how we're going to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| That way, we can get public comment in on our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| and still be able to put it together and submit it to HUD in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| Our final plan has to have the actual amounts of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| So we do have to, whatever will go to council for final approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| will have the actual amounts of funding in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| This is just a better way for you to see what our allocations have been since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| We're hoping for even funding, but it looks like we will get some more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| which is really good news for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| So the way we set our budget is we take the amount of the federal allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| We add in any prior year funds that haven't been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| We add in what we think we're getting in program income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| and like I said, those are from those loans that we made to homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| over the last 20 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Those come back into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| That's called program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| We reinvest that right back into our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| and so this is the total amount of funds that we will be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| Home the same way, that's our federal allocation, our program income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| and then we get to our total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| So our total resources out of those two programs is $3.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1983)|
| 0:33:14| And this is the way we are breaking that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| You can see that to promote affordable housing is where we're spending most of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| That's 82 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Rental rehab and development and owner-occupied rehab and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| those two pots of money are the largest we'll be spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| We'll also continue the down payment assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| The reducing in homelessness, once again, that's that grant that comes from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| and all of that goes to rapid rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Those are direct payments to residents, citizens, to get them into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| So it's either the payment of an old utility bill or a deposit, rent deposit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| or it can be several months' rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| but it's a direct payment to help them get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Strength in neighborhoods, we do charge our blighted property maintenance to our federal program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| and that's the amount of money we use to mow lots that we have or that we have to stabilize houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| When we buy a chronic problem property, most times we have to go in there and board it up, make it safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| If we're going to show it at all, we might have to build a floor in part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| We don't fix it up, but we get it to where we can actually show the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| And then to promote economic development, the two programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| workforce development and the design and technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And then our administration costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| If you add in all the programs that we fund, we're at just 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| So here's our timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| We had our first public meeting in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| We're working on the annual action plan now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| We're presenting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| We'll have the draft available April 6, and that will be on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| We also put hard copies in various locations around town where people can access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| Our 30-day comment period runs from April 6 to May 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| We'll have a public meeting again on May 7 to go over the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| We don't have a date yet when we'll be bringing that to you for vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| Once again, that's based on when we get our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| But our consolidated plan is due no later than August 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| Of course, we hope to have it submitted long before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| And we will finally be doing a groundbreaking on this in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| We have a tentative date of April 23 for the groundbreaking for Southside Flats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| so please look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| So with that, I'm going to open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Thank you, Ms. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| I do have one or two things that these, especially the new council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| may or may not know about, and I may not even be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| The commercial facade improvement grants loans, are those not for five years and forgivable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2182)|
| 0:36:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| It's actually structured as what's called a deferred payment loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| So there is a lien on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| So it's loaned, but each year 20% is forgiven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| So if everything is going well, taxes are paid, there's a business in there, things like that, it will forgive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2205)|
| 0:36:54| If nothing's happening, it doesn't forgive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| So it stays on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| If we do, and this has happened, if we do a facade on a project and nothing comes of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| and the owner decides to sell it, the full amount of the money has to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| And secondly, is there a timeline on South High?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| I'm not sure if I know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| I believe they are hoping to be finished, let's see, at the end of 2019, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2245)|
| 0:37:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Are there any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Wow, it's a shy bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Did I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| Director Wade, I just wanted to ask, I know you and I have talked about affordable housing in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| so I thought maybe we could just spend a quick second on that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| I know you addressed it in your presentation, but one thing I've always kind of tried to wrap my arms around is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2280)|
| 0:38:08| you hear about affordable housing all the time and the need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Is there any sense for, you know, how much need is out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| I'm assuming it's going to be a lot, but I'm just wondering if there was some sense for what we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| what we're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Well, a couple of years ago when we started hearing about this and looking into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| we calculated that we were going to be losing around 700, 800 affordable units in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2311)|
| 0:38:42| and those were low-income housing tax credit developments that had finished out their affordability period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| and so they were selling to private owners who decided not to keep it affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| So that may be one way to get at that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| We know we need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| We're trying every avenue we can think of to encourage people to apply for our funding to develop affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2345)|
| 0:39:14| and I feel very good about what we've gotten so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| We've gotten six applications in now since the fund started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| so you'll be seeing more and more of this come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| Is that part of the $2 million fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Is that number something that you're seeing as a global number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| Is that an annual number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Is that something you're seeing a trend growing towards more need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| I mean, again, I would assume the answer is yes, but just wanted to get your take on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| I don't think we're ñ you know, I'm not seeing ñ we're seeing a need for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| I mean, the signs are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| There are more people on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| The homeless count was up, but a couple of things are coming along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| KCDC is building and replacing the housing out in Five Points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| and so a lot of those units are going to be coming online, and I think that is going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2410)|
| 0:40:18| The fact that they have project-based some vouchers has made it much easier for developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| to develop affordable housing because the rent is tied to the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| And so there are a lot of tools working in concert for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| The fact that the city does pilots for low-income housing tax credit rehabs has helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| Several projects decide to go back to the state for tax credits and stay affordable for another 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| So I think that's another tool that's helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| So all of this is working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| It's just hard for me to quantify exactly what it is we need, but we need more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| and we're certainly focused on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Yeah, yeah, Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| I don't know if this is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| It's also, Councilman, a function of poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Wages are not keeping up with rising housing costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| so it's really just a function of people not being paid a living wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| and not being able to afford the housing as it's increasing in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| I'm going to get you some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Yeah, I would really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| And obviously, in your report, you're outlining a lot of different ways that the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2491)|
| 0:41:40| through your office, is really working on addressing these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| so I just want to commend you for everything that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| And so the final question I have is just in relation to all of the projects that you're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| is there something you're seeing in the future, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| in the near future that you're thinking that we're going to need to be able to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| or is there some need that's out there that you'd like to be able to address but you haven't been able to yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2522)|
| 0:42:11| Yeah, we're seeing more and more family homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| I think about a month ago, CAC had 17 families living in cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| That was reported to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Family Promise has, I don't know how many families on their waiting list that they can't serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| So, you know, it's all about affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| but if there were some family shelter type facility, that might help some of this on the short term, temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2557)|
| 0:42:50| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Ms. Ryder, do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Well, thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| This has been, as usual, a big deal, and you all do a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| If there's nothing else, we will stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180322?start=2586)|
