| 0:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| First item on the agenda is item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=807)|
| 0:13:44| This item has been before us previously and postponed for further study in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| Staff recommendation is to approve the amendments to Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| Code as presented in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| We have a number of people signed up to speak before us and to speak before and against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| I would like to propose that we limit remarks to two minutes per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| I think we have 12 people signed up, if the Commission is agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Ms. Ball, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| And do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Seeing opposition, would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Get that list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Mr. Bob Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| Bob Wetzel, 1015 Luxor Street, 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=897)|
| 0:15:07| First of all, I want to thank you all, as I did last time, for serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| You all give a lot of time down here, probably the most contentious, hottest seats in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| when it comes to property and things along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| So thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| And thank you for the 60-day delay from the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| There has been some conversations over the last 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| I kind of find it ironic and a little disappointment that the changes the city has proposed have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| nothing to do with comments made, I heard, at any of the community meetings I was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| The fact that they've said, we want more properties eligible, we want less land for four, we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| less lot requirements for fourplexes and reduced parking requirements, all seem to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| move towards favoring more development, which is, of course, the intent of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| I understand there's some need out there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| I do find it ironic that none of the things that came up at the meetings that I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| from neighborhood sides are reflected at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| As I've said before, this proposal has a whole lot of risk for neighborhoods, very few upsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| for them, and very little upside for the city, though there is a chance there will be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| more houses, duplexes, fourplexes built out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| The great risk in our historic districts, which I live, is there will be conversions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| You're going to take a lot of R2 properties and effectively make them R4 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| You don't change the map, but you change the wording underneath the map, and so R2 becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| R4, and you make those neighborhoods essentially R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| The same thing happens in all the other neighborhoods in the city that are affected by this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| the great issue there is going to be demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| People will be taking down older houses, neighborhood character building houses, with the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| to, because the amount of density they'll be able to put on those properties will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Let me remind you that the neighborhoods involved are Lonsdale, Beaumont, Mechanicsville, Oakwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| Lincoln Park, Old North, Knoxville, Forth and Gill, Edgewood Park, Belmarsh, Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| Park City, Morningside, Linden Avenue, and most of East Knoxville from the stadium out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| to Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| These are communities that have worked hard over the last 50 years to stabilize themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| and it seems kind of, well, it seems very odd to me that we've decided to put these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| communities under more tension and more risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| So I would ask that you all would defeat this today and not send it to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| I have very little hope that will happen, but that is my ask today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1060)|

| 0:17:59| My name is Debra Thomas, and I live in Oakwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| I'd like to read something from the planning site's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| Zoning protects the rights of property owners while promoting the general welfare of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| It is your obligation to protect workforce housing, which is in short supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| I was neutral for missing middle because I support the concept, but we already have mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| use with apartments and duplexes, but very little parking in the neighborhood before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| autos were built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| I'm speaking against this zoning change because of the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| What's missing in the missing middle housing is the disappearing middle class and affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| WAIT-TV just had an episode on Monday that showed that this was about affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| and it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| Since we last met, there's been additional loss of affordable housing in Oakwood, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| though proponents of this measure say demolition won't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| Nine or more single-wide trailers were demolished, and a single-family home will be demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| to make room for multiple townhouses on Oldham Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Please see my email for pictures of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| It's just two pages of pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| So without demolition protection and what essentially becomes our enforced zoning, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| area is in danger of losing even more workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Anyone with a few hundred thousand dollars to invest could buy up several distressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| houses on a block and profit by this new zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| This will displace low-income families, particularly near Central Street, where houses are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| care-worn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| The out-of-town LLC that invested in Oldham Avenue spent over $600,000 for a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| property fronting Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| They also own another property across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| This is a zoning change which neighbors already ejected during recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| There were no signs for a zoning change, no openness, no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| Please vote no on this item or exclude the lower-income neighborhoods without demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| protection like Oakwood and Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| If you don't, it's just a modern form of urban renewal removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| I'm against this for my neighborhood of over 25 years which is experiencing intense gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| We've lost over 20 structures in the past decade which were affordable to be replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| by structures that cost over $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| I thank you for your time and I thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| Please vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you, Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1209)|

| 0:20:23| Gordon Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| I live at 1000 Eleanor Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| This is the age of diminishing returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| I want to thank the Planning Commission and the City of Knoxville for pursuing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| for increased housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| I hope that this proposal will give small developers, especially minority-owned developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| an opportunity to develop vacant lots along the main corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| I also applaud the design guidelines so that these structures will blend in with existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| But I do have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| The proposed development of vacant lots and conversion of existing houses to multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| will invite outside neighborhoods with bigger money to come into our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| This proposal will also open the door for demolition of existing houses which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| kind of go against the policy of sustainability that the city has been a staple for the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| four administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| The conversion aspect is most disturbing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| The conversion of existing single-family homes into duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| can destroy the fabric of neighborhoods by creating a more transient community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| These converted homes, as we've seen in the past, are often owned and operated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| absentee landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Our neighborhoods already have a mix of multifamily and single-family as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| Creating more density invites the risk of upsetting the balance between single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| housing and multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| I speak to all this from living in my neighborhood for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| I've kind of seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| I've seen investors come in and I know the implications of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| So after meeting with city officials at a recent neighborhood meeting, no data was given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| outlining the success of missing middle housing in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| It's kind of appalling to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| It seems like that would be the first thing you would look at is the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| So what is a measure of success?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| Success can't be measured just by increasing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| The long-term impact on neighborhoods has to be taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| So this proposal is based on trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| The question remains, how does this proposal benefit our neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Or does this benefit developers more than communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| A strong community does not come from forced development of new structures in our existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Strong communities are built by the people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| I again ask that this proposal be modified and limited to the main corridors and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| in the neighborhood themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Mr. Cogar, if you could wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| At the minimum, the conversion aspect of this proposal should be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Dustin Jurem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| I'm speaking in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Ms. Ball, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| Cheryl Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| I'm chief policy officer for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| I think you all already know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Thank you for the time that you spent on this initiative as our team, which includes both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| city and planning staff, has been diligent about including Planning Commission and City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| Council throughout the work on missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| As a quick recap, there was a workshop for this body in the fall of 2022 when the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| was completed by OptiCoast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| A workshop for City Council followed in March on the study, and another workshop was held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| in September for City Council on the proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| An additional workshop was held for Planning Commission a few weeks ago in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| You have taken the time to dive in and learn the details of this proposal, and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| you taking the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Since this body met in October, we've continued our outreach to many neighborhoods, various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| groups and organizations, and interested individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| You've seen the specific details in the memo provided on the planning site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| We began working with the University of Tennessee College of Architecture and Design back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| I want to thank Professors Trisha Stuth and Ted Shelton and their students for their collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| with our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| The students attended public meetings like this one, workshops and open house events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| They looked at our zoning proposal, applied the proposed changes to specific properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| and created architectural models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| It's been a great collaboration, providing students with a snapshot of the behind-the-scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| work that goes into this type of zoning change, and it has provided our team with invaluable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| insights into our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| As you know, middle housing is house-scale buildings with multiple units and neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| that are walkable, bikeable, and have access to transit and neighborhood servicing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| The goal of this middle housing proposal is to change zoning code to allow the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| of more diverse housing options for the residents of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| The continued engagement with our community has helped inform this plan at all stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| The most recent version in front of you reflects a few additional tweaks, including the addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| of RN1 in the TDR geography, adjustments to the administrative variations, and generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| clarifying language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| This plan will significantly reduce the barriers to the development of middle housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| in the traditional neighborhood residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| Again, I appreciate the time you've spent on this topic, and I will be available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Thank you, Ms. Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| Mr. Dustin Durham, sorry to call you out of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1578)|
| 0:26:34| I am extremely excited at the potential of community progress and public good that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| plan brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Is it perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| There are a few things I'd change, primarily, and I say this as both an Old North neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| and as a KTA commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| I wouldn't demand off-street parking in a part of our city where most lots are within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| a half mile of transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Demanding parking is bad for transit and bad for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| But as they say, let's not make the ideal the enemy of the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1618)|

| 0:27:42| and gives both renters like myself and owners more choices in the types of places they call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1662)|

| 0:29:08| I'm speaking in support of the proposed missing middle housing policy, specifically to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| increased density it supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| I believe that along with this needed zoning reform, allowing for contextual house scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| density models, this policy is a major step towards advocating for and advancing sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| growth plans in our communities, minimizing sprawl and supporting density near our urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1766)|

| 0:29:35| less materials and resources, and sustains preservation of and access to unused lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| Additionally, it is our charge as architects and you as policy, zoning, and building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| decision makers to progress the platform for code mandated, highly energy efficient, resilient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| healthy buildings to mitigate what would otherwise leave homeowners and occupants vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1792)|

| 0:30:02| Furthermore, as a homeowner in our city that will live through these changes as they progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| I believe for this proposal to be successful, specifically regarding the potential increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| of rentable units, it is imperative to clearly require continual landlord and property investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| and discourage the unwanted detriment of these properties due to absentee landlord situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| which is evident today in some of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Additionally, speaking to the greater discussion of parking, this isn't just a missing metal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| issue, this is a citywide issue that must be solved in ambitious and inventive ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| If we envision a city that isn't dependent on surface lots, garages, and neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| with cars often parked in the front yard, we must champion bolstering Knoxville mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1836)|

| 0:30:45| To solve the housing crisis, we must do things differently, including implementing measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| like missing metal housing policy, but this also presents an opportunity to adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| respond to other pertinent issues, including quality of life, transportation options, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| the global climate crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Knoxville can and should be the example city that takes proven steps forward in maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| a sense of place and community while addressing the housing crisis via a framework that values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1865)|

| 0:31:41| I believe this proposal will help restore the traditional neighborhood character of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Knoxville's oldest neighborhoods, which historically featured housing diversity, walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| and streetcar transit oriented toward the working class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| Although I was disappointed that the proposal didn't advance at the last meeting, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| the revisions made in the last two months have resulted in a much more compelling proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| There's so much work to do to make metal housing types accessible to more lots throughout our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| city, but I believe this proposal is a strong start toward that goal, and I urge you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1931)|

| 0:32:45| and I'm going to just briefly echo the comments that I left online, which were that this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| is a small step toward addressing a various number of problems, including climate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| We know that denser areas are better for the climate, lower carbon emissions, more alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1975)|

| 0:33:04| We know that we're in a loneliness crisis, right, and that walkable communities where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| you can borrow sugar from your neighbors, which is what I have in Old North, those types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| of communities, which we do not have very many of at all, are better for mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| Also physical health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=1999)|

| 0:33:24| We have cardiovascular disease crisis, where we know that walking and being able to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| to a destination, to a park, not just walking for leisure, is better for physical health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| and also housing affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| We know that increased housing supply decreases costs, maybe not as much as we would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2019)|
| 0:33:48| but it does affect housing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Average rent in Knoxville right now is over $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| I've never paid that much in rent or a mortgage, but that's because I was lucky enough to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| property probably around the same time that most of you bought property, but I have friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2040)|

| 0:34:11| settle down or own, and their incomes are less than ours and their costs are more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2051)|
| 0:34:19| Also housing diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| This allows for more diverse options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| I heard an opponent say this would increase transience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| I say that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| If your kids move out, if you graduate, if you're older and you want to downsize, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| a lot of reasons not to be stuck in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Knoxville has a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| I want more people to be able to have the opportunities that I had when I moved here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2079)|

| 0:37:32| I have on the agenda for January a pocket neighborhood, and it's at 1717 Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2252)|
| 0:37:40| I just wanted to give an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Right now, we can put 48 units on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| If this zoning passes, which I'm much in favor of, with the parking, the smaller units, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2266)|
| 0:37:59| smaller lots, if we go with the 18-foot wide, we can put 78 units on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| That's an increase of 38 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| This piece of property is bounded by 640 Buffet Mill and Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| I'd like it to be Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| It's just out of the zone, I think, that you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| I would like to put forward also that if we address a 16-foot wide module, if you're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| modular construction, which we have used, it's very hard to get a permit for 18-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| wide modules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| So if we use a 16-foot wide module on our center units on townhouses, that would also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| increase this to 85 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| I just wanted to give that example and say that I'm much in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2324)|

| 0:38:59| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| I'm Caroline Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| My address is 903 Wingate Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| I have resided in Knoxville for over 40 years and, in fact, lived in the same house for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| all of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| And though it is an R-in-1 neighborhood, it truly is not an R-in-1 neighborhood because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| there are many small, single-family lots with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| There are apartments and even retail in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| But nonetheless, it's a very, very popular place for people to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| So it shows that there's neighborhood character, that there are different types of people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| the neighborhood, and that we're much more socially connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2380)|
| 0:39:48| The amendments allow for young people, especially, to find housing in neighborhoods where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2388)|
| 0:39:58| feel comfortable walking in their neighborhood and feel socially connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| It also allows for seniors who want to downsize but don't want to leave their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| They want to move into a smaller house or apartment or even a small townhouse in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2410)|
| 0:40:18| neighborhood where they can walk, and especially if they're not able to drive, that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| live close to some place with transit that they can get to their doctor and to the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| So at BikeWalk Knoxville, we support this amendment to the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2430)|
| 0:40:39| We feel that it's going to be very beneficial as far as creating some more density to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| neighborhoods and with lots of different types of housing that are going to follow the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| of the amendment and allow people with different needs as far as their transportation, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2454)|
| 0:41:04| family situation to be in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2464)|

| 0:41:16| fatalities and serious injuries on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| These zoning amendments that allow more variety of housing types in walkable and transit-accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| neighborhoods aligns with the Vision Zero goal to build places where people can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| where they want to go safely without a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you for your hard work on all this, everyone involved in it, and we just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| again to support the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2503)|

| 0:42:09| to walk with their kids to school or ride their bike to pick up groceries, make any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| of those types of daily trips outside of a car that we know we need more of in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| community because that enables, that has a host of benefits, everything from public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| to community safety to benefiting the local economy, the types of things that we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| to see more of in and around Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2547)|

| 0:42:32| I have not lived here my whole life, but in the few years that I have called Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| home, I have loved getting to know these people and this place, and it has been my honor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| privilege to serve this community through my work with BikeWalk Knoxville, my service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2561)|

| 0:42:50| And with that in mind, I am personally really proud to support the Missing Middle Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| Proposal because I think it serves the type of people who want to come and call Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| It serves not only our current residents, but also all of the people who want to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| here, who want to live in this type of place, who are, like me, anxiously searching for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| a type of housing that fits not only their budget, but also their lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| And I encourage you to pass the proposal to help serve all residents of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2593)|

| 0:43:36| Obviously I'm in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| Like others have said, it's not perfect, but it's a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| I hope that we will continue to revise this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| I would urge that we think about eliminating the parking requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| That's an incredibly challenging factor when trying to build on these older lots in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| TDR area, and I don't think it's necessary, like a CAT commissioner just said, CAT's within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| a half a mile of almost every one of these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| So I'd urge you to think about maybe removing that, but otherwise, I think this is a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| first start, and I hope you all will vote in the affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2649)|

| 0:44:50| It's a crisis that touches the lives of our friends, our families, our neighbors, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2690)|

| 0:45:00| data bears out that is the demographic who's worsely impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| According to our research, the starting salary that's posted on the city's website for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2705)|

| 0:45:16| I, like most of you, believe Knoxville should be a community where people of all backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2716)|

| 0:45:23| To achieve that goal, we have to grapple with the reality of working class families being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| shut out of the most desirable, prosperous neighborhoods in our city because in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2728)|

| 0:45:38| families can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| I also want to touch on why our association continues to advocate for the removal of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2740)|

| 0:46:30| I would also just say most of these neighborhoods were built before we had parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| so in a very odd way, taking the parking requirements out is a way to both honor the character of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| our neighborhoods and address our housing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Thank you, Mr. Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| That wraps up everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| All right, so we'll go to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| Okay, Miss Crockett, we heard a number of folks comment on parking as being a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2818)|
| 0:47:10| in your all's testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| How did you view that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Yeah, so to provide some context, our staff, just in order to make sure that the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| dimensional standards technically work, our staff tested the minimum lot widths, an average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| lot depth, the required parking spaces, and the maximum building footprint just to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| sure that the standards that we're putting forth actually work on lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| So this process initially identified a few necessary changes to the parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| We included a specific standard to allow triplexes and floorplexes to back into an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| alley if there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| Townhouses already could, so we added those in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| What we found in general in looking at how these site plans worked out is that parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| creates more impervious surface, so there's fewer space for trees, fewer space for residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| yards to enjoy, and then more specifically, we found several specific incidences where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| building the maximum footprint, so that's the building width and depth that are laid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| out in the dimensional standards, it would be challenging alongside accommodating those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| full number of parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| So that's a fourplex on a 50-foot wide lot and a multiplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| So ultimately, this would require the building's footprints to be reduced and the unit size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| to be reduced, which could make things less cost-effective for the builder and property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| owner and more challenging for the people that live inside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| So overall, I'd say the parking requirements affect both the buildings and the sites themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| So I went to the architecture school's open house on Emery Place, I don't know if anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| else saw that, but the models that they made of what could happen was really pretty inspiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| Of course, they're architects, so they make really cool things when there's not a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| wanting to necessarily build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| But it was great to have a lot of conversations with the students, and with a couple of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| and asking what they thought of the proposal, and then kind of leading to what are their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| plans after graduation, there were several of them that it was very disheartening to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| hear them say that they don't think they can stay in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| And to think that our neighborhoods might change by having more people in them in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| negative way, I think is really pessimistic, because there are a lot of younger people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| that would like to stay here, like the architecture students, that I think would be a great addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| to our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| And allowing more developments like these to increase the housing supply in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| that traditionally can support more density, that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| I don't need to reiterate all of the really good comments that the supporters had here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| In terms of the parking, when we were meeting Tuesday to kind of go over that, the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3002)|
| 0:50:11| recommendation that Optico's recommended is one per unit, which is what this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| currently has in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| And the justification was, well, previously it was two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| So I think maybe two was too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| So starting too high and cutting it in half still maybe leaves you too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| So I would like to make the motion to approve the ordinance with an amendment to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3031)|
| 0:50:41| parking requirements within a quarter mile of a transit route and reduce the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| to 0.7 spots per unit everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3048)|
| 0:50:55| I think that would be a good way to start out this policy, I mean, this ordinance, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| kind of see how that works, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| So I've got copies that I've written up for everyone to look at, but it's still pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| So no off-street parking vehicle is required within one-fourth of a mile of a transit route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| and then off-street vehicle parking, each dwelling unit requires 0.7 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| I think there's a lot of benefits, as we've talked about, in terms of being able to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| the projects with a little bit less parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| 0.7 was a number that I came up with that basically came from the ordinance as drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3091)|
| 0:51:39| where if you were within a quarter mile, you get a 30% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| So instead of one, it's 0.7, 30% less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| So that still requires parking if you're outside of that quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| And that is my motion, to approve with this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Okay, so we've got a motion to approve as defined in this exhibit that was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3121)|
| 0:52:10| by Commissioner Schelso, and was it Commissioner Levenson that seconded it, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| Yes, Commissioner Levenson seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| And Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| I also agree with everything Commissioner Schelso said, and I would like to add a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3142)|
| 0:52:31| other very specific wording changes, if possible, if Commissioner Schelso wouldn't mind to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3151)|
| 0:52:39| his motion if he agrees with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| And what I'm seeing specifically is looking at practical implication of these requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3163)|
| 0:52:52| and trying to maintain some broad allowances for contextual design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| So it's specifically, I have two comments about the setbacks that I think we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| alter in, to get really specific, if anyone has it open, under 4.6C, and then number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3182)|
| 0:53:15| should be I think page 38 on the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| Number three of that says front setbacks for middle housing types shall be the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| of block face, plus or minus 5 feet, in no case less than 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| There are instances where you see front setbacks in 4th and Gill that are less than 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3212)|
| 0:53:41| And I kind of hate the idea of having to break away from that context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| So it's very common in our zoning language with setbacks to say a number, plus or minus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3227)|
| 0:53:57| or the average, and then whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| So my modification to that, to amendment modification would be to say 10 feet or plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3240)|
| 0:54:10| or minus 5 feet of the average of block face, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| That's a very minor change, and then also if you go on down to section 4.6G, where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3255)|
| 0:54:25| talks about the administrative variations, I would just include all, for number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3265)|
| 0:54:34| I would include all setbacks, not just corner side setbacks, just because when you start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3274)|
| 0:54:43| trying to design for individual lots in these, there are instances where it may make more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3283)|
| 0:54:52| sense to go a couple feet one direction, a couple feet inset from the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| So I think just allowing staff to have that ability to review those items, if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| a good reason for it, makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| So just including not just corner side setbacks, but all setbacks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| So those are my two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| And apart from that, I agree with the supporters, and I think this will be really good for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3311)|
| 0:55:19| city, and I appreciate that so many of the people who spoke in favor are members of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| neighborhoods and are also involved in the city in multiple ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| I think we heard from a CAT board member, design review board member, and a BZA board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| member, and probably a few others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| So I think that's really encouraging to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| You want to respond to that, Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| Did you repeat the front setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Change that to just say 10 feet or plus or minus 5 feet of the average of block face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3353)|
| 0:56:03| whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| So it's still a 10-foot minimum, but if the average block face is 4 feet, then you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| go 4 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3370)|
| 0:56:19| I think it would be good to hear staff maybe weigh in on what they think of that, or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| there could be another way to accommodate that, such as going to 4-6G administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3384)|
| 0:56:31| variations, increasing the—if you made it all setbacks and just made the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| power 50 percent, that would theoretically get you 5 feet off of a 10-foot requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| That could be another option, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Of what you're trying to get at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| Yes, that could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| But I think if there's a situation where the setback—the front setback says in no case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3413)|
| 0:57:05| less than 10 feet, so there are some areas near the corridors where setbacks are closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3425)|
| 0:57:13| than 5 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| So I think that that would work if that's a more simple solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| Sorry, your purpose here is to just try and contain the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3441)|
| 0:57:30| so that you don't have a developer coming in and having to meet these guidelines when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| actually if they were really wanting to fit, they would be slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| So is it possible that some sentence of that nature is articulated so that it's clear the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| purpose of this variance, if you will, is to make sure that the developer has the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| to be consistent with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| It seems like if that was said and then there's an equation included, that would help clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| things for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| Yeah, I think that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| And I think that that could be done with the administrative variations and just including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| that the intent there is for contextual design allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| Yeah, I can try to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| I appreciate Commissioner Schoelschel mentioning the administrative variations because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| what I was going to ask the question is, could we just address it there versus tweaking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| language in the section you identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| So it sounds like that would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| Anybody else would like to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| All right, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| This is a question more for, I guess, I guess I should know this and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| Going back to number two of Commissioner Salsow's point, is the distance calculated from like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3538)|
| 0:59:08| the closest point of the property line to the next transit line or is it based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| walkability route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| And the reason I ask that, thinking about the property on Loves Creek, based on where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| the property is, if you do straight line, you would be within that quarter mile, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| actual walkability, you'd have to go down Loves Creek, which doesn't have any sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| walk along a busy route, come up Buffett Mill to get into the nearest transit line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| So that's why I'm asking the question how it's calculated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| I'll defer to engineering on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3579)|
| 1:00:01| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| It's actually a practicality we've run into recently in plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Through the wording, it's just a straight line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| And so we, straight line measurement, so we have run into issues where it's pretty big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| roads with no shoulders or sidewalks or a hill between the property and the transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3617)|
| 1:00:25| route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| So to ensure it is a straight line measurement since the code isn't more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3627)|
| 1:00:36| Loves Creek's not in the TDR though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| I was just using that as an example that was brought up, just thinking through how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| calculation would be brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Because again, quarter of a mile, but if you have to go half mile around on some dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| roads that might not have the shoulders and all that, that's where I think we're starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| to get into, I hate changing things on the file when it's been vetted and all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| without thinking through all the ramifications before doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| So that's really what I'm trying to get at, is just making sure we don't have some unintended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| consequences if we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| And I'm glad that you pointed out that the Loves Creek example is not in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| So it is not something that's affected by this current proposal for MMH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| And I know that we did receive comments from some community members who were also concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| about this, but the neighborhoods that they were talking about are not inside the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| So it's not something that would be affecting those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| And I know from some of the meetings that were held prior to today with community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3701)|
| 1:01:50| and talking with Lindsay and hearing from Ms. Ball that these MMH guidelines are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3710)|
| 1:02:01| specific in terms of the design guidelines to this TDR area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| So this would have to be completely reviewed, and if it was to go outside of the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| So I think that's really important for the community to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| I loved hearing from everyone who is in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| It's really exciting to hear the different perspectives there and all the different benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| In addition to the folks that we heard from today, we also had a letter from AARP, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| I thought really bookended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| We talked a lot about young people moving here, and then here's an organization that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| is an advocacy group for older individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| So we really do see many different types of people who are interested in this type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| I wanted to ask a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| One is about measurement, and I keep being the nag on this, but I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3774)|
| 1:03:04| that in this proposal, we have some components to measure this within a year's time for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| success of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| And I brought this up at agenda review, so I just want to make sure that that gets into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| the work today if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| So I keep looking to Executive Director Brooks about that, just to make sure that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| If this body chooses to pass these amendments, I think it's part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| I think stating that we would like planning staff to track the progress of these if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| amendments are adopted by City Council, and report back after a year what's worked, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| hasn't worked, sort of just give a general feedback on the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| I think you can state that fairly loosely during your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| We already have a motion on the table, so I would ask for an additional amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| the motion, Commissioner Schelser, to include that measurement component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| I don't typically see that codified, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| It doesn't have to be part of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| It's not part of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| It's just a directive of this body to planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| Again, I think that even stating that on the record now, I mean, it would be noted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| If there's some way that it can be codified, that's my desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| Another thought is you could ask, as part of the amendment itself, add it to our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Please add this to your work program where you will track progress of these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| over the next year and report back to us in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| And so then that would be a directive to me to add it to our work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Maybe a silly question, but just curious about if the off-street parking requirement were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| to be reduced to .7 spaces per unit, if somebody builds a duplex on a vacant lot, that's 1.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| What does that practically look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Is that, are we rounding up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Are we building 1.4 spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| Are we rounding to the nearest whole number of spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| We addressed that at the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| Mr. Berry, do you want to get up and speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| Sorry, I didn't know it was a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| There is a rounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| I mean, he'll best describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Brian Berry, City's Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| If the number is 1.4 or less, it is rounded down, so it would be one parking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| If it's 1.5 or more, it's rounded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| I guess just a follow-up question to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| I know one was the number that was initially recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| Is there any kind of concern with .7, noting that that will be rounded down in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| of a duplex, or is staff comfortable with that number and kind of that ramification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| I don't know if that's a loaded question, but just curious to get reactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| A little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| I think staff is—I think we would be okay if you all wanted to make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| Again, it's something that we've been given the directive to track over the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| and if this was to be passed by this body and council, it's something we could report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3990)|
| 1:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| I just wanted to also ask Director Brooks if you would be tracking with codes complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| from TDR for neighborhoods that they may have about any of these new missing middle houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4007)|
| 1:06:56| that are being built, and if there's any complaints that are arising as a result of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| You know that we do not track complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Will codes be tracking that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| That would be a question that I would direct to Mr. Berry if they have a mechanism to track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Obviously, if we're monitoring this over the next year, we'd be very interested and engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| in wanting to check in with them on a regular basis about what they're hearing on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| end, so it would be very deliberate on our part, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Complaints are recorded in 311 typically with the city, and they're divided out to respective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4053)|
| 1:07:41| departments to respond to them based on what the complaint is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| They're tied to an address, and so I'm thinking we could take the addresses over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| year and refer them back to and tie them to any kind of address associated with middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| I assume you get a lot of complaints about parking in these areas now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| I guess my biggest concern would be parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| Parking in front yards, parking inappropriately, people not being able to find parking, off-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| parking in some of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Could that be something that you could track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| The city could track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Our codes enforcement, neighborhood codes enforcement, typically handles those complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| I guess I appreciate everyone's comments today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| I am supportive of missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| Is it perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| I don't think any of us probably agree it's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| I do appreciate all the time that the city has gone into this and all the community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| that has been given for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| I worry sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| I'm going to support the motion on the table, but I do worry sometimes about changing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4136)|
| 1:09:05| in our meeting when there's been such an extensive amount of community input given and then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| changing something, and especially our staff, I feel like is going in and making a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| effort to try to find something that's agreeable to both neighborhoods and developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| We need a place to start, and I guess as long as there's processes in place to track going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| forward over the past year or two years to make certain changes so that it's agreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| to these neighborhoods as well, then I feel like I can support this amendment on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| motion that's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Thank you, Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| And again, I hate to be the trying to think through all the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4187)|
| 1:09:55| I'm wondering if there's a way to accomplish what you're going for, Commissioner Shell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| but also give some flexibility within the codes department that we could maybe look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| at saying off-street parking, vehicle parking, each dwelling unit requires between .7 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4206)|
| 1:10:14| and 1.0 upon final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Give them some flexibility because not everything is equally applied, and again, if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| rounding down and you're building two and it only calls for one, but really two would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| be needed in that area, there's no flexibility for them to go back and say you got to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| two in just based on where this might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| So I'm just trying to give a little bit of flexibility within that so that I guess the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| city has some final say based on that, but it's not handcuffed one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| It's really where I'm just trying to make sure we don't get ourselves, because you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| unring a bell and if we just change this on the fly today to .7, all of this starts happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| we get a year down the road, we come back to change it, we can't unring everything that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| happened up until that point, there's problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| I think that the way the ordinance is written, it has to have one unit per, one spot per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4267)|
| 1:11:21| unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Is that the way it's currently written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| So this is allowing you to have less than one unit per, one spot per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| If I could just clarify on Commissioner Smith's comment, are you saying, have it written that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4292)|
| 1:11:41| way so that if there was an instance where Plans Review had been receiving complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4301)|
| 1:11:49| about parking and they're looking at a site and saying there's room for more parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| you're only providing one or two and we think you should do the full one per unit, giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| them that freedom to enforce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| That's what I'm looking for without saying, no, they can't, but also not saying that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| have to go to the max right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| Again, just giving some flexibility because this is new and coming in, give a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| of grace all the way around for what will eventually be the new Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| That's really where my mind is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| Commissioner Smith, while this may be new to us, it's really not new, new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| And I've often referenced 12th Avenue South from 8th to 12th Avenue, and they have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| parking requirements and it has worked very successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| So there are, I guess, examples out there that prove this to be a plausible option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4362)|
| 1:12:53| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| I was going to somewhat echo what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| And also, I normally agree about not changing things in meeting like this for all the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| that Commissioner Midas just referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| In this particular case, I would even be willing to look at something more aggressive than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| what Commissioner Schelso is offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| So I'm not concerned about what he's offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| And part of that rationale is what Commissioner Hill has raised with Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| We talked about in the agenda review session, Atlanta as another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| And then the number of comments from people who were in favor of this proposal who said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| that as well, that they would be in favor of even a more assertive addressing of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4418)|
| 1:13:46| parking requirement really stuck with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| So that's why I feel comfortable with this change and I'm comfortable if it goes a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| I guess, yeah, I'm not wanting to change anything so much, but I guess the question too, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4437)|
| 1:14:05| could it be handled, that 0.7 be handled under administrative variations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| Similar to right now, the city works where if you're within a quarter mile of the transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| you can apply for the 30% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| We're talking about eliminating that within a quarter mile, but could it be possible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| just say if you're in the TDR, then you are allowed to have or asked for up to a 30% reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| or reducing one unit down to 0.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| That might give staff a little bit of, if there's negative feedback or if they look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| in one instance, as Mr. Smith was saying, well, it just makes sense that there really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| needs to be two parking places right there, but you only have to do one, but we'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| it if you did another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| It would give them the opportunity to say, well, we understand what you're asking, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| in this scenario, we think that we would not necessarily approve that variance, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| administrative variation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| It's just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| I just wanted to throw it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| I'd support, yeah, that thought of kind of providing the administrative variance, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| I was just going to say that doing some quick math over here, I think I'm getting more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| with the 0.7 number as well because in a quad unit, it rounds to three, and then you add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| one for off-street parking, and you're at four, and kind of that same logic applies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| all the way down, so I think when you include the off-street parking that would be in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| of any of these lots, you end up matching one for one the units with the number of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| spaces that would be available, whether that's off or on-street, so I just wanted to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| that small revelation on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Yeah, and let's not lose sight of there's not going to be this widespread building of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4548)|
| 1:15:56| middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| This is going to be so incremental that you're talking, when we talk about parking, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| not we're going to be having this flood of parking needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| You might see one to a particular area in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| That would be probably my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| I mean, these are going to be very small in numbers, so when we talk about the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| for parking, I don't think we're talking about a flood that we're all of a sudden changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| a desire for greater parking need, because it is so incremental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4590)|
| 1:16:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Oh, and just to add that there are so many benefits to reducing parking, as Ms. Crockett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4599)|
| 1:16:46| said, you know, the green space, trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| It protects pedestrians on street parking, protects pedestrians on sidewalks, just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4609)|
| 1:16:57| you see down Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| It's what helps make those areas so walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| They feel protected, protects bike lanes, so a number of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| It also reduces speeds on our streets, so a lot of benefits to that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4627)|
| 1:17:15| Commissioner Schelso, have you regretted making this motion yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| So if you would allow a little dialogue with Mr. Higgins for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| Commissioner Higgins, okay, so for setbacks, so you said all setbacks, meaning particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4646)|
| 1:17:36| thinking rear setbacks as well, is that why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Because the side setback of five feet, I mean, that's our minimum setback for any structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| of any sort, a shed, well, no, I think you can get a, yeah, no, it's five for everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| I believe, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| So what would be the reasoning to allow a greater side setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| And then additionally, I think there are some building codes with fire that you can't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| what two buildings, five feet, closer than five feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| So if we were to go with a 50% reduction in a side setback at two and a half feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| I mean, I guess you could, the neighbor could do that too, but yeah, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| I'm glad you pointed that out because that would be a driver here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| If someone was trying to get within five feet of the property line, they would have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| a fire rating on that wall and any openings on that wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| So it's highly unlikely that anyone would want to do that if they were, that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| necessarily apply when you're up against a right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| So that's why you can have like a zero lot on a front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| But I think having it as staff, just to not add too many points, that's why I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4727)|
| 1:18:56| all setbacks, because I do think there are instances where rear and side setbacks may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| need, it may make more sense to go one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4743)|
| 1:19:11| And to your point, though, I think 20% makes sense for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| I think greater for the front setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| So again, if we were to try to broad stroke, apply this and say all setbacks, 50%, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4759)|
| 1:19:28| would still be two factors controlling that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| There would be the staff's review of that, and then there would also be the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| code aspect, which would say if you are that close, if for some reason staff says, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| we will allow less than five feet here, you're still going to have to have that fire rated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| to a pretty extreme, and that would dissuade most people, unless there was a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| where it really just made sense to do that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| So that's the reasoning for including all setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| So a proposal to add a number four, theoretically, front or all other setbacks, because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4804)|
| 1:20:14| would not already include the included side setback that's written, or you want to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| that one too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| We could modify number two to say corner and corner side and rear setbacks to 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| and then add a fourth one that says front setbacks up to 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| That would be probably the cleanest way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| Up to 50% provided the setback is consistent with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Do you think they should be consistent with the neighborhood for all setback variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| I think that would be up to staff's review to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| It may be a situation where there's a tree that you want to scoot over the building just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| to save, and I'll let Amy comment on that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| I'll just comment that that's the overall intent of this entire section, these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| is to make sure that whatever is built is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| So that doesn't need to be written in, necessarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| I mean, I actually would encourage you to write it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| So I will change my amendment to, for 46G1A, I'll add a fourth, it's new, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4882)|
| 1:21:36| Front setbacks, a decrease in the minimum front setback up to 50% provided the setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| is consistent with the neighborhood, and then amend number two of 46G1A.2 to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4901)|
| 1:22:00| side setbacks and rear setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| So side setbacks and rear setbacks, along with corner side setbacks, would all get 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| reduction, and there would be a new fourth section that allows front setbacks to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| up to 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| So I amend my amendment to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4939)|
| 1:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| I'll re-second your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| I just want to make sure that Lindsey Crockett, who's worked on this so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4952)|
| 1:22:41| is tracking those and saying, yes, this is fitting nicely with this plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| In general, I feel comfortable with the changes that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| I would add that these dimensional standards have maximum building widths and depths, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| helps in that there's always going to be a maximum that the building itself can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| And I think we did select the interior side setbacks at a maximum at five feet to account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| for those building code reasons and to ensure that folks would be able to incorporate windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| on their side elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| There are also design standards that speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| So in general, I do feel comfortable with those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| And one last amendment, Commissioner Levinson, if you would listen, to add that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5003)|
| 1:23:31| like to add a progress report of missing middle housing added to the work program upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5011)|
| 1:23:39| the anniversary of the first missing middle housing development approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| Not a year from passage, but the first one getting approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| Seeing no other lights, everybody clear on what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| Commissioner Schelso's revisions that he just spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| So a yes will be and a vote for approval of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| So all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| We've got two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| Two noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| What's our count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5060)|
| 1:24:31| Motion passes 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Computer is going to sleep here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| We'll now be addressing agenda item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5078)|
| 1:24:54| To give some background to item number six, the attached amendment to the city zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5094)|
| 1:25:15| code article five was proposed by Mr. Bentley Marlow in August of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| At the August 10, 2023 meeting, the Planning Commission recommended zoning code amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| to enable middle housing in the city follow the process of implementation as defined in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| the September 22 missing middle housing scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Mr. Chairman, I am so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| Before you go on, the item we just did, what I've got before me says an amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5138)|
| 1:25:46| Did we just vote on the amendment only or was that the actual motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| That was the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| At its September 5, 2023 meeting, City Council referred the ordinance back to the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5155)|
| 1:26:05| Commission for further review and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| The proposed amendments are summarized below, which includes establishes a new setback standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| in cases where the CN zone features residential use and abuts residential districts, in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| case the minimum interior side setback along shared lot lines with residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| would be 10 feet or 20% of the lot depth, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| Item two eliminates the minimum corner side setback in CN zone except when site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| cannot be achieved, in which case the minimum would be 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| Item three reduces the minimum rear setback from 20 feet to 10 feet unless the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| abuts a residential district, in which case the rear setback would be 20 feet or 20% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| the lot depth, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| Staff is recommending denial of the amendments as proposed to the City of Knoxville Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| Code Article 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| As permitting for residential uses in the CN zone occurs within plans review and inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| planning staff do not evaluate residential development in this zone and further analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| would be needed from both departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| Finally, setback reductions based on housing forms are incorporated into the city's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| middle housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| You may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5251)|

| 1:27:38| I know the city's proposal and the scope of OptiCoast didn't include CN, but as somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| who's out in building missing middle housing for years in Mechanicsville, which is inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| the TDR, I think this is needed to open up potential on small lots or what's smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| than many would consider on some of our corridors going, not real big corridors, whatever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| connectors next lower level like University and 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| Those need to be developed with commercial nodes and take advantage of the CN zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| and I think the best way to do that is by using that space kind of as mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| We hear a lot from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| They're wanting to do that on our major corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Why not also look at doing it along our connectors like 5th and University to create neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| corridors in our neighborhoods and also simultaneously address housing crisis, and to do that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| some of these smaller lots, we need to think about reducing these setbacks, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| the side setback and then the rear setback when it abuts the residential because if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| using CN to do residential so that we can get more density because CN was excluded from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| the missing middle proposal, I don't see why it makes sense to require larger setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| I get it if you're putting a tire shop or some other commercial use on that CN, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| if we're using it for townhomes or duplexes or triplexes or whatever we're building for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| housing exclusively, I think we should reduce these setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Thank you, Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| It seems like this could actually be beneficial because CN is meant to be within neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5352)|
| 1:29:23| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| It's a commercial zoning within neighborhood areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| It's a lower intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| So I don't see why a use, if you were doing a residential use next to a residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5368)|
| 1:29:39| just because of the zoning, it doesn't really make sense to me that it would have a greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| setback than its neighbor might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| So I don't know if staff could comment on why that shouldn't be altered in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5386)|
| 1:30:02| There's a number of different uses that are allowed in the CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| It's not just residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| I think that is primarily one of the concerns is at any point in time those uses could change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5405)|
| 1:30:13| by right under that particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| So you're saying if someone built residential and then they converted it to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| that would be the concern there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Is the possibility of that happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| It could potentially be a concern, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| And it seems like that happens already with the DK zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5433)|
| 1:30:41| Every building down here has had multiple different uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| So I actually, I think that there's some merit to this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| And maybe it should just say, you know, this in a, when the use is residential, then there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5450)|
| 1:30:58| could be some different setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| I'd like to hear what others have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| Because so much of the staff report for this item refers to the MMH that we literally just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| passed and hasn't gone to council yet and may get modified additionally there or may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| pass or may not pass, I do not feel comfortable making this adjustment because it seems to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5481)|
| 1:31:29| be referring to something that is still in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| So I would not be in favor of passing this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5493)|
| 1:31:42| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| Yeah, I agree that there's the concern about, you know, how do you permit it and say, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5505)|
| 1:31:52| it's a residential use, but then it changes later upon completion, I think is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| And this was, you know, analyzed, it seems, in the scope of missing middle housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| maybe it shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| And so I wouldn't be opposed to, you know, kicking this like way down the road and like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| waiting for city council to do what they do with the missing middle housing proposal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| then us looking at this maybe in a different lens in like 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5543)|
| 1:32:33| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| I definitely feel better about that than I would trying to do something right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| I guess thinking about the work program of planning, is this, is that the place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5563)|
| 1:32:53| needs to be positioned, which is just a different concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| Director Burks, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| I just want to point out, I mean, this is stated in the staff recommendation, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| think it is important for us to mention again that permitting residential uses in the CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| zone occurs within plans review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| Planning staff do not evaluate residential development in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| And so further analysis by our department, it couldn't just happen within the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| So we would need really plans review and inspections as well, probably taking a lead in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| And I don't think that's within the purview of this body is to direct them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| I mean, it can be a request to monitor it and take a closer look at it, but I just caution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5617)|
| 1:33:46| I move that we postpone for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| We've got a motion by Commissioner Schelso to postpone for 90 days, seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| We've got a still a lot or two on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| Yeah, I was going to, I guess, suggest that we maybe postpone for longer than 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| I don't know what we'll know new in 90 days, but I guess besides how council votes on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| but it seems like maybe the more year check in once we see how the missing middle has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| actually been adopted and, you know, if this is a barrier that has kind of been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| because it wasn't identified as a barrier by the optical study, I feel like that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| be a more appropriate time where we'd be more informed to revisit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| But I understand there's already a second on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| So, we have a motion and a second to postpone for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| A question about if we don't postpone, it's longer than 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| Would that make, would we be tabling this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| We can postpone it when we get there if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| We'll let this motion go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| I was just going to mention, I was just looking at the use matrix and I feel like by approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5704)|
| 1:35:12| this and if a residential use is used on that lot, you're going to actually probably, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5712)|
| 1:35:20| were going to probably dictate what happens along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| I mean, there's a special use for many of these, again, eating establishment, offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| I mean, some of these things are special uses that we would have to consider whether we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| would be willing to allow for special use in the CN given that there's, it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| be abutting a neighbor, a residence with a very limited amount of setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5741)|
| 1:35:48| So, I don't see myself supporting this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| I don't know in 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Maybe this question is appropriate for Mr. Berry there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| Mr. Berry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Brian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Brian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| Mr. Berry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| We've got a question for you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| Is there a way, is there a way to, if they confine it or restrict it, I know we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5765)|
| 1:36:13| to vote on postponement, but we can have a little discussion here, to that once it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| defined as residential, that it cannot be, it could not be backfilled by something other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5778)|
| 1:36:28| than residential, so it couldn't be existing non-conforming, that in order for it to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| really to perform as CN non-residential, you'd have to basically tear the structure down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| and go back to the, whatever the setback is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| Is that a clear question to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| I'm going to have to ask you to repeat that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| So, what we're talking about here is reducing setback if residential, in a residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5811)|
| 1:36:59| in CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| And the concern is that it becomes something other than residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Isn't that our concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| I don't know if that's a concern necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Is there another concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Okay, so let's go on with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| Is there a way to, I guess, secure that to where it could not be a non-residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5832)|
| 1:37:24| unless they tore the structure down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5844)|
| 1:37:33| Would it be, what I'm asking, does it become legal non-conforming if the use changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5853)|
| 1:37:41| non-residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| Do you have to give me just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| Let me look at the code here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| While he's doing that, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Also, again, we were talking, we talked about residential adjacent to commercial and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| potential conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| But again, I want to point you back to the staff report and the staff analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| And there's the two, I mean, I think there's a number of really good points in here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| terms of the staff analysis, but the last two in particular call your attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| Eliminating minimum corner side and reducing rear and interior side setbacks could result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| in construction of buildings, which may be out of scale with the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| And then additionally, allowing city of engineering department to set the setback during permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| would create a situation in which applicants could submit plans that were not approvable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| during that due to the uncertainty of the setback standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| Again, we just think that this needs, if this was to move forward, it needs more analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| by plans for new inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| Thank you, Mr. Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| So we have a motion and a second to postpone for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| I need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Oh, well, maybe you didn't answer the question, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| You got out of here without answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| She distracted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| So my thoughts on that are, it looks within the zoning code in the commercial neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| there is no distinguishing setbacks between a residential or a non-residential structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| So if something was built as a residential structure, it would be required to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| with the setbacks associated with CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| Now if that use went out and a non-residential use wanted to go in, it would have to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| building code requirements in order for whatever that use would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| There would also be parking requirements associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| So as far as the question as to whether or not we could, whether it would require the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5969)|
| 1:39:37| demolition of the structure and a new structure, that would be kind of speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| I think it would be a case-by-case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| We couldn't require it necessarily to be demolished if it could be retrofitted and meet the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| code and meet the zoning code from a residential use to a non-residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| If the non-residential had a setback that did not comply, but it did comply with residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=5997)|
| 1:40:04| okay, so I think what we're saying here is we were going to decrease it for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| use, but not for non-residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| Could you enforce that to where it wouldn't be legal non-conforming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6013)|
| 1:40:22| I don't think so, but I would defer to the law department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| Maybe we can ponder that for 90 days if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| I mean, in a lot of these scenarios where we're thinking about building residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| on CN, another reason for postponing 90 days is, I mean, we may have missing middle in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| our code and a developer could apply to rezone their property to a residential zone with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| a five-foot setback, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Yeah, good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| So, it might not be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6054)|
| 1:41:00| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to postpone for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| We've got two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Is that right, Mr. DeAlmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| We're on item number seven, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| On to item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6085)|
| 1:41:32| Staff recommendations recommend approval of amendments to section 10.3B3, removing requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| that building officials certify the utilities are adequate for an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6099)|

| 1:41:52| 10.B.8, removing maximum gross floor area requirements based on lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| Background, the attached amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| Okay, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| The denial of amendments to section 10.3.A.4, removing the 18-foot height requirement for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| accessory structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| 10.3.B.2, removing the owner-occupied requirement in TDR land use areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| 10.3.B.4, removing the minimum lot area requirement for an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6145)|
| 1:42:32| Part of 10.B.7, allowing ADUs in front and corner side yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| 10.3.B.9, adding a new standard based on primary dwellings smaller than 1,250 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6159)|
| 1:42:47| And 10.3.B.11, removing the parking space requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| The attached amendment to the City of Knoxville Zoning Code, Article 10, is a revised version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| of the amendment originally proposed by Mr. Bentley Marlowe in August 2023, Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| At the August 10, 2023 meeting, the Planning Commission approved an amended version submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| by Planning Commissioner, Exhibit C. At its September 5, 2023 meeting, City Council referred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| the ordinance back to the Planning Commission and its staff for their review and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| The proposed amendments are summarized in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6207)|
| 1:43:35| Our Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas Avenue, 3791.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Yeah, so just trying to open up and make better use of our ADU ordinance in the city because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6221)|
| 1:43:48| not many are getting built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| Many are being built illegally as just accessory structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| The only difference being you can't have a cooking appliance in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| You can't have food in there until you're moved in later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| This would bring conformity to allow people that are doing this already, they could now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| do it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| The 18-foot height requirement is very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| When you want to have a garage that will hold an SUV or you want to suspend a bike or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| kayak or canoe over your car, I'm working on a project like that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| We've got all this urban wilderness and we're encouraging our greenways and blueways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| It seems like we need to allow accessory structures to house those bikes and kayaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| I didn't mean to allow ADUs in front yards, only corner side yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| I guess that was an oversight on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| I don't have the luxury of having a staff to help me, so I'm okay with modifying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| 10.b.7, but I really think we need to get away from the owner-occupied requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| I know that's the most contentious, but that is what's holding this back from being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| I think we could narrowly tailor this and put it only in the TDR areas, mimicking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| MMH that you just passed as a trial run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| If you recall from the Optico's reports and the Optico's book, Missing Middle Housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| they advocate the usage of ADUs all throughout the book on all types of their housing styles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| up to the quadplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| I think that this could dovetail into that nicely, and it can also stand alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| I think if we do this as a pilot, removing owner-occupied limited to the TDR areas, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| could see if any of the Armageddon hellscapes that West Knoxville folks fear actually come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6325)|

| 1:45:48| The recode process conceded previously legal duplexes in service to misinformed ideologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| about neighborhood character, and awarded the consolation prize of ADUs or accessory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6354)|
| 1:46:01| dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| One concerned with housing supply and affordability would hope that one lost duplex or two homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| equals one gained ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| Also two homes when you count the single family home in front, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| Well, this is simply not the case in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| Planning staff in a previous iteration of this assembly have expressed their surprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| at how few permits have been issued for ADUs since recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| By the way, I'm kind of curious about what that number actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| I think that would be good for us to know if staff is willing to comment on that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| Some background about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| I'm a proud resident of Oakwood Lincoln Park for six years and lived in Old North just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| I was born in a small town in Western Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| I am an architectural designer by day, and my wife is a teacher at Christenberry Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| Together, we set out to build a 400 square foot ADU recently and found that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| cost about $100,000 to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| Sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Guess what it appraised for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| For those who don't know, when you're building a new structure, the bank appraises that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| appraise the design drawings before the build to determine if the project is financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| Well, it appraised for $20,000, one-fifth of the cost to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6444)|
| 1:47:34| So to accomplish the build, I would only need an extra $80,000 on top of a typical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| cash contingency and down payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| So that was the death of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| Purely from a financing perspective, it's no wonder that ADUs are not getting built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| I would venture to guess your average Knoxvillian does not have a spare ADK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| So what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| How can zoning policy change this financing issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| Well, the botched appraisal comes from a lack of comps or comparable properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6483)|
| 1:48:10| Our current zoning policy of requiring on-site owner occupancy for ADUs prevents developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6490)|
| 1:48:18| from building ADUs, which was the intent, and thus reduces supply and reduces comps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6498)|
| 1:48:28| Because of that policy, no one can build an ADU unless they build it with cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6508)|
| 1:48:36| Who has that kind of access to cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| Developers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| I urge you to strike down the on-site owner occupant rule so that we can start getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| some comps in the marketplace and regular people can enjoy a granny flat, a mother-in-law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| suite, a place for their college student to live, house a traveling worker, or provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| an affordable unit for someone who may otherwise be forced to rent more expensive, larger unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6539)|
| 1:49:06| whether they need it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| If I have a few extra moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| Mr. Jerrigan, if you could just wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| I have about one other paragraph on another topic if I could just quickly go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| I'd like to discuss the height restrictions for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| The current maximum height for accessory structures precludes garage apartments, which are a typology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| that most people like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| Garage apartments are useful to accommodate parking, housing, and impervious surface considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| congruently, a win-win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| To build a garage apartment, you'll want a nine-foot ceiling for the garage, one foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| for the floor structure, eight-foot minimum ceilings for the dwelling unit above, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| feet for attic insulation, and at least one to two more feet for attic ventilation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| roof structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| This assumes a low-slope roof, and it totals just over four feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| In the interest of finishing up quickly, if we could just make a small adjustment to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| height, we could allow a whole new typology of garage apartments, which people like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| Thank you, Mr. Jerrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Thank you, Mr. Drew Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| I'm Drew Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| I'm from 4318 Washington Pike, number 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6614)|
| 1:50:25| I can give, like, half of my time back to Aaron for him to—meaning I'll only take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| a couple minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| I echo what the previous two speakers said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| I want to touch on a couple things, namely on setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| I believe I spoke about this when this was first brought before this body, and I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| about the safety benefits of decreasing setbacks, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| If we have narrower lines of sight for cars and motor—there's just—study after study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| showed that that's safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| Since—it's a bit counterintuitive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| Since that time, people have died in Knoxville, but pedestrians and cyclists, they've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| hit by cars on very widely designed places and died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6663)|
| 1:51:10| I saw a recent stat that if the United States had matched our peer countries in working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| toward Vision Zero, as BikeWalk was talking about earlier, we would save about 20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| lives a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| Also, on the parking requirement, just briefly, I have a house in Old North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| I have zero off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| If I were to build an ADU, I would have to basically replace an on-street spot with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6689)|
| 1:51:34| off-street spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| It creates more impervious surface, which is bad for the environment, etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6695)|
| 1:51:44| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| Thank you, Mr. Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Christina Bowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6709)|
| 1:51:55| Christina was here earlier and had to leave on account of picking up her child and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| asked me if it would be permissible to read her comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| I think you guys okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| So this is—these are read comments for Christina Bowler, 302 Douglas Avenue, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6734)|
| 1:52:22| I support removing the owner occupancy requirement for ADUs as well as increasing the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| height allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| The owner occupancy requirement for ADUs is unenforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| For example, if an owner builds an ADU legally and then sells the property, the next property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| owner is able to lease the house and ADU to separate tenants without occupying the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| Furthermore, property owners can choose to occupy an investment property as their primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| residence for a short time merely to meet the owner occupancy requirement and move out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| after the ADU receives occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| My understanding is that very little can be done by the city to meaningfully enforce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| owner occupancy requirement because of these loopholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| I believe this regulation is unfair and an unnecessary burden to incremental development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6786)|
| 1:53:14| There are already so many barriers to ADU development independent of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| ADUs tend to underappraise, making them difficult to finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| Many lots are too small, have topographical challenges, or have other structures on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| lot which would make ADU development prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| There are many reasons why we would not expect ADUs to pop up everywhere if we lessen these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Since this proposal has been amended to apply only to the TDR, the opportunities are even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| Furthermore, it harmonizes well with the city-proposed ordinance amendments by providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6823)|
| 1:53:49| an alternative option for adding an additional unit on lots with existing single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6829)|
| 1:53:55| making demolition of the existing housing even less likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| I'll start off by saying I agree with a lot of what staff has said in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6850)|
| 1:54:17| I do see some flaws in some of the, or some potential problems that could come from some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| But I do think that the owner-occupied requirement, regardless of the zone or the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6864)|
| 1:54:35| doesn't really make any sense to keep because it's, and one of the speakers mentioned this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| it is not really enforceable long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| It's not the same as, you know, we have a requirement with short-term rentals of owner-occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6885)|
| 1:54:53| and that's an ongoing thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| With an accessory dwelling unit, it's very simple if someone is really determined to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6896)|
| 1:55:03| you know, build one to change their address to whatever that is, build it, and then change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| their address back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Or if they live there, build it, sell the house, and now it's no longer owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| Doesn't make the community any worse off because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| And I think that this requirement is outdated, and we've had this allowance since, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6918)|
| 1:55:28| this opportunity to do ADUs since recode, and have not seen widespread application of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6928)|
| 1:55:35| and I've definitely, I don't think, seen any issues from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| So I think that it would make sense to remove that, and I think a potential compromise could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| be looking at maybe if we could add it as a special use, where if it were not owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6945)|
| 1:55:53| they would have to go through the special use or use on review process and come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| I don't know if that's something that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| Amy's shaking her head, so I doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| But I don't think that, you know, I agree with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| I think that we should remove the owner-occupied requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| So I'll let others talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| Commissioner Schilso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| I also agree that the owner-occupancy requirement should be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| I mean, this body sent it to county, I mean, city council with it removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6980)|
| 1:56:29| So I'd like to go ahead and make the motion to approve the amendments that have been outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6989)|
| 1:56:37| to be recommended approval per staff, section 10.3.B.3, part of 10.B.7, 10.B.8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=6997)|
| 1:56:49| and making 10.3.B.2, removing the last sentence of that current code as written, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7009)|
| 1:56:59| one of the dwelling units must be occupied by the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7024)|
| 1:57:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| So we have just catching up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| We've got a motion by Commissioner Schilso, as described by Commissioner Schilso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7037)|
| 1:57:23| So we've got some things we're approving and some things we're not approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| So basically, he's going by staff recommendation with the exception of denying the removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7047)|
| 1:57:35| of the owner-occupied requirement in the TDR land use areas, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7055)|
| 1:57:41| Everybody clear on that, what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| We've got a second by Commissioner Higgins and Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| I know there's been some commentary about the lack of ability to enforce owner-occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| and I'm just curious if, like, similar to the missing middle sort of diligence, if staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| has done any work with talking to maybe some peer cities as a prior resident of Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| I recall that, like, that was a requirement in Nashville, owner-occupancy, and don't recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| hearing, you know, challenges with enforceability and know that was a deterrent for some neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| kind of being converted into, you know, short-term rental properties with kind of both properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| being rented out simultaneously, ADU and the main structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| So I guess, yeah, question to staff, like, around this issue, do we know if other peer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| cities have adopted, you know, no requirements for owner-occupancy and what results have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7108)|
| 1:58:34| been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| And I guess, if not, I'd love for us to spend more time on that before approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| I know that we do not have that information, we have not done that research, we also don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7121)|
| 1:58:48| issue permits, that's something that the City of Knoxville handles for these, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7128)|
| 1:58:55| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| Okay, so I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| I'm looking through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Is the staff's recommendation in green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| The green text is the amendments proposed by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| So what is staff's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| So the staff recommendation is what's on the screen right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| The sections for approval are laid out and then denial are laid out in the second position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| It's the first page, the memo in front of the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| So the only deviation is the 10.3.B.2, and that would go up into the approval group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7170)|
| 1:59:40| if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| I'm proposing that we approve what's recommended for approval, plus 10.B.2, whatever, the removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7184)|
| 1:59:54| the owner-occupancy requirement everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Not just in TDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| That's what I'm seconding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| I was unclear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| So striking from the current code, the last sentence only of that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7207)|
| 2:00:17| In addition to staff's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| Are we clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| Is everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| Commissioner, are you also, with the exception of 10.3.B.2, recommending denial per staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7233)|
| 2:00:43| recommendation of the other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| Staff recommendation for everything except for removing the owner-occupancy requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| Everybody clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| You clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7257)|

| 2:01:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| I'm just going to say that I won't be supporting this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| I am aware of how much public input went into allowing ADUs all throughout the city, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7267)|
| 2:01:14| that owner-occupancy was a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| Whether it needs to stay or not, I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| I'm agreeable to maybe changing that, but I feel like the public input needs to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| and hasn't happened yet regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7289)|

| 2:08:21| I want to speak on behalf of the Historic Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| I'm the current executive director there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| And I just want to take a few minutes to talk about the Ramsey House for those of you who don't know who we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| and kind of explain a little bit about what our mission is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| We are a private 501c3 nonprofit organization and part of the Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| which oversees eight other historic homes across Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| We are not a state or a federal historical site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| so a vast majority of our funding comes from tours, events, sponsorships, and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| We as an organization are very locally based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| I am the only full-time staff member employed by the Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| And our board of directors is entirely volunteer-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| with a vast majority of them working full-time in the greater Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| I also want to take a moment to ask our community members and representatives from other historic homes to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7751)|
| 2:09:18| We do have representatives here from James White Fort, Blunt Mansion, Marble Springs, and Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| as well as some community members with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7764)|

| 2:09:35| we did submit a letter that does include some community signatures on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| I don't know if that was part of the packet that you guys did receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| but I do have some copies of that to pass around if that was not in your online packet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7783)|
| 2:09:50| We depend entirely on volunteers to help us put on our events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| as well as to assist with the upkeep and the maintenance of the house and grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| We periodically host events such as our free outdoor vintage baseball games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| which this past year brought in 1,900 individuals to our property across the six games that we hosted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7802)|
| 2:10:09| They play by 1860s rules, which means they don't play with gloves, they use wicker bats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| there's some funky rules that go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| But we welcome teams from across the state as far as Nashville to our historic grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| We also host our annual Ancient Sounds Music Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| which is an outdoor celebration of Celtic and Appalachian music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| which is held on our historic grounds Labor Day weekend and is our largest fundraiser of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7828)|

| 2:10:39| the Ramsey family, the individuals who are enslaved on property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| and the Cherokee Native Americans who utilized the land prior to the Treaty of the Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| We welcome schools to our site, integrating state standards to our tours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| and providing a kid's opportunity to have a chance to experience history firsthand inside of our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7851)|
| 2:10:57| Of course, we focus on the house itself, showcasing how life was lived in the early 1800s, late 1700s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7857)|

| 2:11:06| Francis Ramsey is an important part of Tennessee's history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| serving as Secretary of the Convention, called in 1785 to draw up the Constitution for the proposed state of Franklin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7869)|
| 2:11:16| and later served in various other capacities during the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| Being directly off the highway, many guests are shocked at how peaceful our property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| due in many parts to the vegetation buffer between us and the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| allowing visitors to the Ramsey House a real opportunity to visit the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| not just in the house itself, but on our historic grounds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| Preservation of not just the land our historic house sits on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| but our surrounding areas is important to maintaining our slice of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7901)|
| 2:11:46| The original vegetation buffer that was left behind Dollar General, that 50-foot vegetation buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7906)|
| 2:11:52| has eroded and noise is already becoming an issue on our historic property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7912)|
| 2:11:58| not to mention the trash that does blow off the highway directly into our wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| And I do know we do have a couple other historic houses here who were talking to me recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| that say the noise pollution from the highways and the streets that they are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| does cause disruptions during their daily operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| But the parcel in question was sold by the Ramsey House Board of Directors in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| This predates my involvement with the Ramsey House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| and in fact involvement of the current Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| It is an entirely new board that sits in the place of the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| But I can speak a little bit to the institutional memory that we do have of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| Dr. Charles Faulkner, who was a UT archaeologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| he did expansive studies on the Ramsey House property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| Indeed, a lot of our interpretation of the house comes from what he was able to find during his studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7963)|
| 2:12:50| I believe he worked with us for 15 some odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| But the parcel that was sold off was never officially actually surveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| to determine its historical significance to the Ramsey House property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| And I do know that when the Board of Directors at the time did sell off the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| there was a pretty massive community backlash directed at the historic Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| And amongst the Board of Directors at the time, there was a lot of contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| And I want to thank you guys for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=7998)|

| 2:15:24| the fact that he was an abolitionist against him, he still went on to become Secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8124)|

| 2:15:50| doesn't help keep out the sights and sounds of John Sevier Highway. I can't go back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8150)|

| 2:16:00| buy it back or to invest in beaver control. But I can stand in the gap and try my best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| to keep another used car lot from being put where the trees now stand. Those trees along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8166)|

| 2:16:46| My name is Dale Roten. I live about a mile from this property. My address is 4315 French| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8206)|

| 2:16:59| was owned by the Ramsey House and sold in 2014. And, of course, the request at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8219)|
| 2:17:06| time, the Ramsey House came to do what I'm doing now. They was asking for the dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8226)|
| 2:17:14| store to buy that piece of property beside that's there now, and then the adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| on the front. If you show the map, that's not correct. It's the L-shaped map. The one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8239)|
| 2:17:23| before that, that you had up there, is what we need to see. Yes. See the PC is there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8243)|
| 2:17:32| the dollar store. The part behind it is I'm wanting to leave that part that's adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8252)|
| 2:17:41| to, now this was not in the case of the Historic Commission. It was the whole 5.7 acres, 5.77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| At this point, these are the people, the Ramsey House and the Association of Preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8268)|
| 2:17:58| of the Tennessee Inequities, were selling that property to KME, who bought the dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| store. The dollar store now is selling that property nine years later, and we have reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| a contract, assuming we get the historic overlay removed, on the front portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| which is on Johnsville Highway, 2.5 acres. So I'm keeping roughly 40% and giving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| historic district roughly 60%, and a 200-something foot buffer. That's why I'm showing that L-shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| The whole L-shape, six-foot property, will stay. There's an arrow right through the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| back of the dollar store and the whole back of the front. So it is straight across from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| where the dollar store is, only to Johnsville Highway, on the exit on Johnsville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8315)|
| 2:18:42| All the thorn gold pipe to the Ramsey House, even the park that will be in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8322)|
| 2:18:48| here, will be all zoned, or remain zoned, agriculture with a historic overlay. So they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8328)|
| 2:18:56| can do what they wish. Call it what they want to, no excavating, no worries, because when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8336)|
| 2:19:02| this was sold, the Ramsey House was wanting this zoned, commercial, and the historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8342)|
| 2:19:10| removed. And at the end, they didn't want the wetlands. Well, this section that's broken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8350)|
| 2:19:15| off, it retains all the wetlands, and the tree line is going to be the same as it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8355)|
| 2:19:21| got with the dollar store. You can't get that close to cutting trees down, and I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8361)|
| 2:19:28| to cut any trees down anyway. It's just brush is all that's right in front. It has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| maintained for nine years, you can imagine. But anyway, what I was asking for is, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8372)|
| 2:19:39| the CA zoning, and the section which is in front only, the 2.5 or 6 acres, 2.5 something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8379)|
| 2:19:46| acres, to have the historic overlay removed, and the other 360%, the 3.14 acres, 3.25 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8386)|
| 2:19:56| to be left the way it is. They can retain the historic overlay, and the wetlands will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8396)|
| 2:20:04| not be bothered. It couldn't bother them anyway. I don't know why. I wouldn't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| So in conclusion, I'd just like to say, well, first of all, the planning staff, we tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8408)|
| 2:20:17| to vote on that five, the acreage of the smaller amount, and we couldn't because it had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| initiated as 5.77 acres. So this is the first time a vote has been done on removal of only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8423)|
| 2:20:29| the front part of the historic zoning, while the rest of them had the whole zone, even when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| it was sold in 2014. They approved the front. They couldn't break off just the wetlands because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| it was not surveyed that way, and they didn't bring it back up. So my due diligence to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| to purchase this is that we get this overlay removed and CA zoning, and they can retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| roughly 55, better than 55 to 60 percent of the property the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8452)|
| 2:20:58| And let's see. It's on that map right there in conclusion. That way, you would retain the buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8458)|
| 2:21:08| the zone, and you've got a quarter of a mile from Ramsey House to John Deere Highway now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| and then you go out to turn right and go another 600 feet just to get to this property. The only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| entrance would be from John Deere Highway. It wouldn't bother the Ramsey House in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| that I can imagine. So I appreciate your vote. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Roden. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8483)|
| 2:21:31| Higgins. I just have a question for staff. If the historic overlay were to remain there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8491)|
| 2:21:39| I know that historic overlay does not prohibit use at all, and I can't imagine it would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8499)|
| 2:21:46| you build a log cabin there even if you, you know, something that strict. So what is the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8506)|
| 2:21:56| overlay prohibiting right here? Correct. So in this situation, the historic zoning overlay just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8516)|
| 2:22:03| introduces an additional level of public process in the design review of what is constructed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| the site. So it's not how it can be used that's related to the base zoning, but it's what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8528)|
| 2:22:14| site and the buildings that are constructed on the site look like. The design guidelines for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| broader property are relatively general. They're the overarching federal standards for historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| preservation. They don't recommend that something be identical to the historic site from which it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8545)|
| 2:22:32| associated. So you're correct. They would not be required to construct a, you know, a stone house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8552)|
| 2:22:38| It's primarily just that the new work is compatible with the historic materials, features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8558)|
| 2:22:44| size, scale, and proportion and massing of the site, and then that related new construction is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8564)|
| 2:22:51| undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. And we have a standardized design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8575)|
| 2:23:00| review process. I know Commissioner Higgins, you're well familiar with it. We've got a monthly meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| and a deadline associated with each meeting, and we handhold developers through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| And staff agrees that removing the historic overlay from the John Sevier side would not be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8589)|
| 2:23:20| I don't know, would not take away from the character of the Ramsey House property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8600)|
| 2:23:28| Yeah, staff recommendation is based on the current request, which is for only the 2.5 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8608)|
| 2:23:36| of the property, and staff thought was that it does not restrict any commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8616)|
| 2:23:45| It will just be consistent with the historic zoning commission's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| So, I'm very much in support of Ramsey House for sure, and any of the historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8633)|
| 2:23:59| buildings we still have left here. So, I appreciate the historical zoning board's opinion, but so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8639)|
| 2:24:06| can you expound on Mr. Roden on the historical zoning commission's decision to remove the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8646)|
| 2:24:14| 2.5 only to have that section removed? Because I can see how an application can be made, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| the decision that has to be rendered, and I just don't want to see kind of the baby thrown out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8659)|
| 2:24:25| with the bathwater saying, okay, we can't remove it on all of it, because I firmly believe, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| think in what you're saying, is that we can't remove it on all of it, and we can't remove it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| all of it, and we can't remove it on all of it, and we can't remove it on all of it, and we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| remove it on all of it, because I firmly believe, and I think in what you're saying, is the wetland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| area for sure needs to stay, because contrary to what people believe, even though it is in a wetland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8685)|
| 2:24:50| you know, from a development aspect, it's beautiful. I mean, I drove out and drove around and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| tried to get a real feel for everything out there. It's a beautiful wetland, but if somebody owns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| that property, it could be developed. Now, you'd have to go through a lot of processes with TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| and get into a lot of remediation and things like that, and I don't think that's what anybody ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8708)|
| 2:25:13| wants, but my point is, I think it is a good idea to leave the historical zoning there for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8713)|
| 2:25:20| On the front, as I drove up and down John Sevier Highway and all that area out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8720)|
| 2:25:26| it's very industrial. It has a very industrial feel. There's pipe manufacturers, there's concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8726)|
| 2:25:32| and earth movers, junkyards, you know, there's a lot of things like that in the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8732)|
| 2:25:41| I just don't think that it necessarily takes away from the Ramsey House if that one section only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| is not included in it, but my question getting back to that is, is there a reason that you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| ask for it separate in the beginning? Well, I thought you had to ask for the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8752)|
| 2:25:58| because you couldn't break it up. Then in the process, it was broken up, and then I took it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| the historic committee then and said, I just only want the front part, and they could not vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8764)|
| 2:26:11| as a separate section. I think, is that not correct? Because I tried to get it to break up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8771)|
| 2:26:18| and they said it was presented at 5.77. I couldn't break it up, so that's why I made the note today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8778)|
| 2:26:24| to make sure that this is the first time that it's ever been presented that way, but that's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| I've ever wanted to do that, because, I mean, I don't want, I mean, I live in a mile away. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| want to be, yeah, I mean, but I mean, it's commercial property. It's right on the, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| it's, yeah, the, and I don't want, I don't want industrial. The industrial is all the way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| it, so this CA is a big improvement from what will be, or what is now. Well, I guess that brings me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8803)|
| 2:26:49| to another question. I know we're not necessarily there, but CA is kind of a dual question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| staff. I mean, I see the Dollar General got zoned PC through some of these discussions back in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| Is there a reason staff said CA was okay versus planned commercial, or what was the opinion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8819)|
| 2:27:06| that? I think at that time, the applicant also requested for CA for the Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8826)|
| 2:27:14| but planning staff recommended PC because there was, it was not adjacent to any commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8834)|
| 2:27:20| so staff wanted to see the planning commission to be able to see the building that is being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| but now I feel there are some commercial uses, not only to the adjacent lot, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8845)|
| 2:27:30| farther north, so there are some commercial areas in the area, and I think that commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| uses are appropriate for that location. Okay, thank you. On my part, giving up the 60% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8855)|
| 2:27:42| property, if you don't go CA, then you lose another 50 feet on each side, so you've lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8862)|
| 2:27:47| almost another acre of land that you don't have to do an act start with, so you're losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| half the land again. So, Lindsay, with respect, I guess, to some of your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8872)|
| 2:28:00| Commissioner Higgins, who reviews it? I mean, historical zoning, or is it staff? Who exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8880)|
| 2:28:07| Okay, so Knox County has a five-person historic zoning commission. They were the body that reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8887)|
| 2:28:22| this, and I'd like to clarify that they determined that removing the overlay on the entire parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| would have an adverse effect on the historic Ramsey House. The applicant did discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| configuration with the historic zoning commission in the meeting, but the historic zoning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8913)|
| 2:28:39| went with the staff recommendation that removing it on the entire parcel would have an adverse effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8919)|
| 2:28:44| The HCC reviews new construction on vacant lots. That's not an administrative approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8924)|
| 2:28:51| so that would go in front of the body. Okay, and you had mentioned, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| some of the federal stuff of how that is viewed, and one thing that kind of struck me, because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| was when I went out and looked at the Ramsey House, again, it's beautiful, but it's got some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| serious hand-stacked stone, really great stone work on it, and I would have a bit of a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8946)|
| 2:29:14| that they're going to say, well, okay, you're going to have to make it look like the stone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| that's on the Ramsey House, that type of thing. It would be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8959)|
| 2:29:24| So, in terms of federal, there's no federal regulations associated with the site. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| that the standards, which are similar to the design guidelines that historic districts have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| are adopted from federal standards, and I think these are way more general than our local historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| districts have set in them. In general, they would not recommend that something replicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8980)|
| 2:29:47| a historic structure. The standard there says new work should be differentiated from the old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| The key there is just being compatible with the historic environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8993)|
| 2:29:57| Historic preservation guidelines typically discourage trying to construct something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| looks old but is not. Got it. So, again, I mean, my feel for it and being familiar with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9002)|
| 2:30:10| even driving down the driveway, and I know the beavers, you know, we can't control the beavers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| but we try to control what we can control, but even in the middle of the winter, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| I had trouble. I couldn't see anything. I couldn't see anything on John Spear Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| any of the buildings or any of that other information or things that are built over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| So, that being said, I'd like to make a motion to approve general commercial land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9030)|
| 2:30:36| because it is compatible with the surrounding development and is a minor extension of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9036)|
| 2:30:41| classification, and also approve CA, general business zone, because it is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9041)|
| 2:30:47| with the surrounding development subject to two conditions. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9047)|
| 2:30:53| approve the request to remove HZ overlay only on the 2.5 acres on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9053)|
| 2:31:02| which leaves the 3.27 acres on the back between that lot and the historic Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9062)|
| 2:31:12| Remove that historic overlay. Okay. We're going to do them separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9072)|
| 2:31:19| but I'll let him run with it because it's more efficient that way, actually. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| thank you, Commissioner Huber. Commissioner Schelso. Oh, Mr. Reynolds, did you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9085)|
| 2:31:33| Okay, I'll get back. Mr. Reynolds. I'm used to using the button on the table still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9093)|
| 2:31:38| I can wait until after the sector plan amendment discussion if that's more helpful. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| thank you. Okay, we've got a motion, and we're seeking a second. Second. Okay, we've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9104)|
| 2:31:52| second from Commissioner Smith, and we've got still some lights on. Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9112)|
| 2:32:01| Yeah, well, you called on me. Oh, did I call on you? Okay, Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9121)|
| 2:32:07| So, we're doing one motion here to approve the land use classification, right? Okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| part of my thinking about the entire property, it being next to the Ramsey House, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9132)|
| 2:32:21| either the historic overlay provides a level of public input to maintain the sort of compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9141)|
| 2:32:28| with the adjacent property, and if the historic overlay is not there, I think we should go the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9148)|
| 2:32:33| route that the Dollar General went and do planned commercial, where then at least the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9153)|
| 2:32:40| Commission, if we remove the overlay, then the Planning Commission would have a process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9160)|
| 2:32:45| public input to maintain the public input of compatibility. Those are my thoughts if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| going to remove the historic overlay. Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9171)|
| 2:32:59| Thank you. Lindsay, it seems like the largest concern they have is about the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9179)|
| 2:33:09| Does the historical zoning overlay protect development from noise in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9189)|
| 2:33:16| No. Okay, thank you. Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9196)|
| 2:33:21| I just wanted to clarify because the minutes from the most recent historic zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9201)|
| 2:33:30| meeting are not on the case file, I don't think. I think it's only the ones from 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9210)|
| 2:33:37| where they did discuss supporting removal on part of this. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9217)|
| 2:33:47| So, the 2014 case was the separate property. That was the Dollar General property at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9227)|
| 2:33:53| intersection. In 2014, they did not review the cell-shaped property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| Okay, got it. I don't think I would be in support of removing the historic overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9238)|
| 2:34:07| although I do think that there could be an alternative where it's planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9247)|
| 2:34:12| but I don't think that the historic overlay is really detrimental to the use because all it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9252)|
| 2:34:19| is an extra step of review, and it gives the neighbors an opportunity to give their feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| and if the design meets the guideline recommendations, then it will be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9264)|
| 2:34:32| So, with this being a sensitive area, I think that keeping the historic overlay doesn't hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9272)|
| 2:34:40| anything for future owners or future development, especially since it wouldn't require anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9280)|
| 2:34:48| necessarily too difficult to accomplish. So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9288)|

| 2:34:55| So, I have a follow-up question for Mr. Roden. If you had to pick your poison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9295)|
| 2:35:03| between a historical overlay and a planned commercial, knowing the planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9303)|
| 2:35:08| has heavier setbacks, landscaping requirements, that type of thing, versus a historical overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9308)|
| 2:35:14| which one would you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| I don't know. I mean, on my due diligence, I don't know what to do either because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9317)|
| 2:35:24| I mean, if you're giving up 60% of your property to historic to keep it like where it is. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| they own this property. For nine years, they had the option to buy this property back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| at a reasonable cost and keep it the way they want it, but this is commercial property on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9333)|
| 2:35:39| Johnson Highway that you try to take care of. I mean, believe me, it's going to be a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9339)|
| 2:35:45| better than anything they've got industrial all the way wrapped around it. I mean, it's not like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9345)|
| 2:35:50| I mean, if they want to control it, I mean, I would step back and they could buy it. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| I mean, I don't think anyone wants to go in there and buy this property and not have an option at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| least using the front of it and let them have the control in the back of it. I mean, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9360)|
| 2:36:09| got over half of it. I mean, it's not like you're trying to be, I mean, I think I'm trying to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| reasonable. I probably won't buy it if I don't get that little part because I think it's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9374)|
| 2:36:22| and I don't know what they would do, but I mean, had they not gotten paid in full for this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9382)|
| 2:36:29| property, I can assure you the front would be the same as a dollar store. It would be commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| and be usable, but that's just my opinion. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9393)|
| 2:36:39| Let's get this sector out of the way and then we'll get back on it. Is that all right, you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9399)|
| 2:36:45| All right, so we've got a motion and a second on approval of the general commercial land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9405)|
| 2:36:53| classification. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. All right, now let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9413)|
| 2:36:59| talk about Mr. Roten. If you'll get back up there, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9419)|
| 2:37:06| What are your concerns with this historic overlay staying on it? Well, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9426)|
| 2:37:13| the property is so grown up in Briars. I stepped in three big, huge anthills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9433)|
| 2:37:20| trying to walk through this stuff that they've left. It needs to be cleaned up and used at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9440)|
| 2:37:27| good commercial place. I mean, it's got all this traffic right up and down the highway of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9447)|
| 2:37:32| Johnsonville Highway. I mean, I live on our property joins Johnsonville Highway, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9452)|
| 2:37:38| I definitely want it nice. If you'll hang in here with me, I'm going to redirect a question to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9458)|
| 2:37:44| Ms. Crockett, but hang by the podium here because I may be coming back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9464)|
| 2:37:50| I'm still trying to figure out what limiting conditions he would have. The Historic Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9470)|
| 2:37:57| Commission will do a routine process of design review for the new construction built on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9477)|
| 2:38:03| property. Okay, so clearing the property. It's not reviewed. No purview over clearing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9483)|
| 2:38:08| So what other concerns might you have? I have not. I've gone to the Ramsey House. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9488)|
| 2:38:19| it's a nice place, but I'm sorry. The historic zoning on this, I'll gladly give them this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9499)|
| 2:38:27| maintain this cover. There's no visibility. They're afraid I'm going to cut trees down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| I'm not going to cut trees down. I don't want it back there. I mean, it's the same as what's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| at the dollar store. They don't like the dollar store. The Historic Commission complained at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9517)|
| 2:38:43| dollar store at the last meeting, and I personally think that's the nicest thing on the highway. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| mean, I hate to say that, but you know, I mean, it's all this industry around it, but I'm glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| to be next to dollar stores, and it's nice. I don't want to go back through all of this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| I'm too old to worry with this stuff, so I can walk away, but I mean. You don't have a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9537)|
| 2:39:05| concern. You just don't want to go back through the historic zoning at all. I mean, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9545)|
| 2:39:10| mean, I wanted to have their part. I want to have the wetlands, which is what their problem was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9550)|
| 2:39:14| the beginning to 2014. That was what the members got upset about. Why they didn't do it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9554)|
| 2:39:20| I don't know. I've talked to them. They just didn't have time to do it. It was on 5.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9560)|
| 2:39:26| They could not separate it at that time, and they was in trying to get this dollar store built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9566)|
| 2:39:32| so they were in time requirements. They didn't care about the other at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9572)|
| 2:39:37| because they need to get their business done. I understand that. I would too, but the other part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9577)|
| 2:39:43| they would let them have it back then, you know, but they couldn't do it at that time, so I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9583)|
| 2:39:48| you know, the logical thing, do it now. Give it to them and let them use it, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| Matter of fact, I think, well, Carson Daly told me that that's what I should do as well. I should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9592)|
| 2:39:58| give them that part in the back to have that, and I know they think they've got total control of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9598)|
| 2:40:05| that. I don't know, but I think commission will go with me. I may be wrong. I just think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9605)|
| 2:40:13| common sense to just let them have the control of the back that joins them. I mean, that's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| or three hundred feet of all the, I mean, the stream, the whole stream, and even part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9617)|
| 2:40:25| trees are on this. I mean, I'm not going to cut those trees, so anyway, I'll sign that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| Thank you, Mr. Roten. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| I was just going to ask staff if there are precedent examples of commercial being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| like within historic overlay districts, and if there have been successful examples of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9637)|
| 2:40:43| the Historical Commission approving commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9643)|
| 2:40:47| Yes, because historic zoning does not relate specifically to the base zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9647)|
| 2:40:52| so there are historic zoning overlays on commercial and residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9652)|
| 2:40:57| and there have been, I can't think of one off the top of my head, but there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9657)|
| 2:41:01| multiple new construction projects, whether that's residential or commercial, in historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| zoning overlays. In front of the major Reynolds house on Kingston Pike and Bearden Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9665)|
| 2:41:11| there's a shopping center, a small strip center in front of that building that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| zoned historic and went through historic, I'm fairly certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9675)|
| 2:41:25| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| In listening to all this, here's where my biggest concern, honestly, is falling, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9688)|
| 2:41:38| an entity sold some property, took the money, and now they want to control what someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| who owns the property does with it. That fundamentally is something I've got an issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9703)|
| 2:41:49| If they want control, they can buy it back. Otherwise, I would support that the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| zoning on this front section needs to go away. He is protecting it on the back half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9714)|
| 2:42:01| keeping the wetland so that that remains, which is honestly more than I've seen a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| do that have come before us with this. I would be more inclined to support what you were originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9726)|
| 2:42:14| proposing, Commissioner Huber, just thinking through that. I don't think we should ask any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9734)|
| 2:42:20| applicant to pick their poison because I think they've gone through the due process, come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9740)|
| 2:42:25| the body. They've walked through this journey. I don't think we should have to try and set them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| back. I would be more inclined to voting to remove that historic overlay on that front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9750)|
| 2:42:38| what, 2.3 acres, but keeping it on the back, keeping the wetlands. Again, if you look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9758)|
| 2:42:44| property, right next door is light industrial. I mean, general commercial is going to be a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9764)|
| 2:42:51| less invasive than that light industrial sitting right next door going to the north of the Ramsey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9771)|
| 2:42:57| House or the heavy industrial, which is across the street. So I think I'm going to use an analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9777)|
| 2:43:05| I think we're making a mountain out of a molehill or an anthill in this case. So, you know, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9785)|
| 2:43:12| knowing the dollar generals there, what can be possible in that area with general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| I think it would be good for the area. It's not going to be as intrusive as the industrial stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9798)|
| 2:43:23| that's already taking place around it. And honestly, I think the industrial would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9803)|
| 2:43:29| more of an adverse impact on that wetland area than what this general commercial would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9809)|
| 2:43:35| as well. So I would be in support of what the applicant is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9815)|
| 2:43:40| Thank you. Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| Thank you. Just to clarify, so we're all on the same page, the Ramsey House has no say over any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9822)|
| 2:43:51| of this and none of the historic groups, Knox Heritage, nobody controls this. It's just an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9831)|
| 2:43:59| overlay that requires that they take it for design review. So I don't see the, and speaking about like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9839)|
| 2:44:10| the light industrial and the surrounding context that has this adverse effect, the point of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9850)|
| 2:44:17| historic overlay is to prevent things that will have a visual adverse effect. So I don't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9857)|
| 2:44:26| harm and there's not a specific reason other than just a desire to avoid going to that board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9866)|
| 2:44:35| having that conversation. I just don't think that that is enough justification to remove it when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9875)|
| 2:44:40| have that board saying, no, you should, we should not remove it. They are appointed to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9880)|
| 2:44:48| recommendation. So I would, if they said, if the historic zoning commission for the county had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9888)|
| 2:44:54| voted to remove the historic overlay on this portion of the property, I don't think I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9894)|
| 2:45:02| have a problem with it at all. But since they specifically had that conversation in depth and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9902)|
| 2:45:08| unanimously recommended that it say historic on the whole property, I just don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9908)|
| 2:45:16| it makes sense for us to then go and remove it. Thank you. Ms. Crockett, did they entertain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9916)|
| 2:45:22| idea of splitting it or did they not consider that? The application did not include that. They did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9922)|
| 2:45:29| discuss it, but they determined that removing it on the entire parcel would have an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| on the property. I'm sorry, would you repeat that last part? They determined that removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9934)|
| 2:45:40| the overlay on the entire parcel would have an adverse effect on the whole parcel. But what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9940)|
| 2:45:46| about the rear part? That's what they determined, including the part fronting John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9946)|
| 2:45:54| Like either one would have an adverse effect? Yes. Okay. So a partial would have an adverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9954)|
| 2:46:01| effect. Okay. Thank you for that clarification. Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9961)|
| 2:46:10| I don't want to talk anymore. You don't? All right. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9970)|
| 2:46:20| What you stated, I'm sorry, and perhaps Commissioner Minus and I heard this differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| because what you said was they discussed it only as it exists as a whole parcel and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9985)|
| 2:46:32| removing it on the whole parcel would have an adverse impact, but they didn't actually vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9992)|
| 2:46:37| on whether or not the front section, because it wasn't included in the application, even if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=9997)|
| 2:46:41| had the discussion, they only looked at it as a whole, not as partial one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10001)|
| 2:46:48| Correct. So there was no actual feedback from that committee looking at just that front part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10008)|
| 2:46:56| if that would be an adverse impact because they only reviewed the whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10016)|
