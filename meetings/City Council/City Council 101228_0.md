| 0:25:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Mr. Mayor, I'd just like to bring up once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| I had mentioned at the last meeting the concern that I had over the Mercer plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| And I just wanted to clarify that, number one, I do think that we have some of the best city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| and they're well deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| I just think that the timing of this, I've had several telephone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| and several comments from some of our taxpayers that are out there in the real world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| who are struggling to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| There are no bonuses. There are people being laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| In my profession, especially, there are a number of people that are on furlough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| And I think that not only are these folks deserving of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| but I just think the timing is not good in terms of us going ahead with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| and especially making it retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| And one of the questions that I had in terms of making it retroactive is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| how difficult is it going to be for, you know, the city to go back and look at these salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| people that have been promoted, you know, how do we deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| And that would be a question I guess I would have for the administration is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| how difficult is this going to be to do this as opposed to starting in January instead of making it retroactive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1581)|
| 0:26:29| I know, I want to turn it over to Mr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| but I know that the idea is that it's a pay raise effective January 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| and it's a bonus retroactive to deal with some of those complexity questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| But Mr. Lyons, do you want to try and explain that a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Yes, Councilman Greve, I believe at this point there was some effort involved in setting that up in the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| but I think most of that heavy lifting has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| It's just a matter of getting it put into effect early in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| So I think at this point there's minimal difficulty involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| And I think the other thing in terms of calling it a bonus is something that I think we need to be real careful of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| especially in terms of what's going on in the economic situation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| That, you know, the employees did, they did receive their two and a half percent pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| We did fund the pension plan to the tune of $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| And I think this council is going to have to really look very, very hard at the next budget that comes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| not only in terms of services that we provide, but also pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| And we're going to have to look very hard at what's going to happen with the pension plan in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| But, again, you know, as I said, it would seem to me that I'm not saying that they're not deserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| and that I certainly do support our city employees and the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| But I think in the general population out there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| they're kind of looking at all of us to make wise decisions and make wise decisions with their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| I've had a number of people say, hey, you know, I'm having a little bit of trouble paying my property taxes this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| And with a million dollars, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| what would that do in terms of helping all the citizens cut their property taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| So I think we just need to be aware of what's really going on out in the general population on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| So I've struggled with this, but I do agree in principle with everything that's part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you, Mr. Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Thank you, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Mr. Greer is right in that we do have difficult decisions ahead regarding our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| and we do have escalating costs in a number of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| However, I disagree with my colleague in that I think having been on this council during the time when we initiated the Mercer study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1718)|
| 0:28:47| this is a commitment that we made when we discussed, negotiated in good faith with all the members of our employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| We sat around the table together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| And in good faith, we talked about what are the parameters of this discussion and what do we hope the outcomes will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| We all agreed on a provider to provide that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| We came to the table and agreed that their information would be binding to us, not knowing where we would come out with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| And we came out with some surprises on both ends, some folks that were ahead of the scale of our peer cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| but also some folks that were significantly behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| And I think we were responsible to the taxpayers and our implementation of those findings in that we realized it was not something that we could bite off all in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1763)|
| 0:29:33| And those employees who were behind were great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| They worked with the city administration and said, okay, we're going to phase this in over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| That's doable for the taxpayers, but it gets us all to where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| And I think all of us, including our mayor, who's not here tonight, were very distressed that we could not adhere to that pledge of a three-year implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| And the plan that was laid out in the mayor's budget was to implement this third year over a fourth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| So full implementation is planned year one and two, but then year three, make it year three and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| And this council said very strongly to the administration, if there is any possible way to put all of year three in, we'd like to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1804)|
| 0:30:12| And so my compliments to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| When the funds came out differently than forecast, and sometimes those forecasts happen in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| that was the first priority on the table was to make good that pledge and that promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| So I fully support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Ms. Palmer, and then I'm going to go to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| While I respect Mr. Greave and the concerns that he has heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| I also respect our employees and the word that we gave in the Mercer study and the three-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| I was extremely distressed in June when we were not able to implement the third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| And so although the word to make it easier to facilitate the payment may be bonus, it's not a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1848)|
| 0:30:56| This is money that we are contractually obligated to pay the employees of the city for the work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| And so I think that we would be extremely remiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| I applaud the administration for putting that right at the top when there was some money available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| I'm going to go to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| I think just a little, an additional piece of history from what Ms. Roddy shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| Again, keep in mind that the three-year plan was not everybody got a third of it the first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| and a third of it the second and a third of it the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Some people got all their money the first and some weren't getting a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| So putting off was selectively choosing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| I mean, it was something that we had all agreed everybody needed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| Some people were held off into the third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| I very much appreciate what the administration is trying to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| And I want to remind people also that what this does, this brings us up to mediocre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| This puts our employees at sort of an average pay for what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| And we don't have mediocre employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| We don't have average employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| So I think that we need to be doing this and ideally a lot more when the funds are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| And right now they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| There's not a budget deficit we're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| This is we have plenty of money in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| So it's a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Let me go to Mr. DellaVoppe, then Mr. Bailey, then Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| But I think it's important for us to recognize that hard times are still with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| And it is important that we be prudent with taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| And that doesn't mean that we don't vote for and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| And I've heard the arguments for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| But I really do believe that we have to look at some of the other items in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| or elsewhere in the budget because I believe that these pay raises, when embedded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| will change base salaries and will affect pension contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| And every dollar we're spending has consequences going downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| So we're going to have to be prudent fiscal managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| And I know that we're all trying to do that and we'll do that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| But we always have to remember and remind ourselves that we do not run this city's business for the benefit of the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1981)|
| 0:33:10| but for the benefit of all of the people that live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| And I know that that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| And I know the administration is trying to get this done and get it done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| But I don't want it to be gainsaid that we are not thinking about our taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| some of whom are struggling, and that we have to be fiscally wise with their dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| And I know you agree with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| So I just want to make those remarks and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| And I appreciate Councilman Grieve's comments and my other colleagues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| But as being one of the council members that went through this entire Mercer plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| and said no last June because we didn't think we had the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| as it turns out, we did better than we thought we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| And so I think it's the honorable thing to do since we did have the money to go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| So I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| I want to address my comments to Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| And I'm hopeful that this business recruitment efforts will result in some good substantial jobs in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2049)|
| 0:34:19| which is sorely needed, especially in these economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| Also, when we do have some extra funds, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| I will hope that some of them will be spent not necessarily in the sixth issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| but in our inner cities, which is also sorely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| But I certainly want to support this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| I want to footnote that because I think Councilman Brown's reference to Section 3 is an important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| As I understand the action we're taking tonight, we are putting these dollars in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| We are not necessarily spending items, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| for the Development Corp to do business recruitment efforts for a downtown business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| but we're in a position to act if the discussions they have become fruitful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| But I think that's an important distinction, that they're in the budget so that we can act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| but we are not spending them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| There will be a separate action by this Council if that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| I believe that is the case as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| And Mr. Lyons is nodding, so that sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| If not, if we're ready to vote, all those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2138)|

| 0:37:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| I don't know procedurally how to do this, but I wanted to just go back and make one comment on 9E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| which we have postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| As they are looking at that provision, which has to do with the alarming systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| please also take a look at ways that we can mitigate the impact on low-income families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| if, in fact, we have a situation where beyond their control we're having false alarms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| because they are going to pay individually renewal fees, and we don't want to unduly burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| and actually out-of-pocket costs by the city, and we have to have some kind of a safety valve there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| so that I'm in favor of stopping bad and false alarms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| but we've got to be sure that we don't hurt people who are in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| And so be looking at that aspect as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| And I thank you for the indulgence on making that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| And I see notes being taken by Chief Price, so that's obviously heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| We're on 9F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2280)|

| 0:38:35| and 18 of the Knoxville City Code relating to maintenance and placement of garbage containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Seeing no up, Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| How is this enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| Mr. Cain, can you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Yes, Mr. Cain, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| This is the change in the ordinance that deals with where the garbage containers are placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| If the containers aren't placed in the appropriate location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| then that would be enforced by neighborhood codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| There could be notice of violation and citations issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| So basically if they don't have their containers out front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| one way is the garbage won't be picked up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Well, you know, we contract that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| The vendor may be lenient to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| but if that continued to be a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| we would direct our vendor to not pick the garbage up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| I apparently was confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| We are on H, which is the garbage containers, and not I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| Okay, I'm going to save my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Any other comments on H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| If not, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2405)|

| 0:40:08| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2408)|
| 0:40:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Yeah, two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| One is a minor one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| On Section 2, it's on the second page of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| It looks to me to be a typo in the second line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| It probably should read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| of property in the city to permit or suffer trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| blah, blah, blah, to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| And we have of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| so if someone would clean that up in the final document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| The second one has to do with that same concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Maybe it's under Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| And I guess I'm concerned about the existing confusion people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| as to where they place some of their garden waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| and some of their leaves and their brush and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| And I know that from time to time we have residents that call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| and say I've been whacked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| and all my neighbors have been putting it in the same spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| I do it and I get whacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| But I think we need some clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| because we're trying to protect the drainage ditches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| and the flow system for stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| We're obviously trying to protect traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| by not putting stuff on the street bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| but some people live in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| where there are limited opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| There are steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| And I don't know how we deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| maybe by regulation or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| but maybe Ron can tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| We're going to have some confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| about where the right place to put this stuff is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| and I think it's an important thing to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| I don't know how we address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| maybe by further regulation or something we give out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| But I can see this leading to questions by individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| and maybe even complaints that are improperly cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| Let me, I guess, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| I've had some experiences similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| to what Mr. DellaVopace talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| and my experience has always been that the codes inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| or the solid waste inspectors are not going out to find people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| that their first contact is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| this is a problem, let's figure out where else it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Am I correct about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| So, I mean, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| And do you even know, do we, and Mr. Mill, you might know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| do we, have we issued, well, this isn't a violation yet, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| Yeah, so I think, Mr. DellaVopace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| a lot of this is the inspector going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| and working with the citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| And in one case in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| it was exactly that where a person had very limited places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| where they could put stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| and they actually had the solid waste inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| and the driver of the boom truck at his house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| talking about where to do it based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| So I think we've tried to work those things out as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| I know we have great employees and we want to work through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| but we're setting it up so that eventually you can get whacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| And so we have to be mindful that clarity is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| I can give you an example of places like North Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| where there's a central street island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| and there might be properties with steep boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Sometimes the people carry their brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| and put it over on the little center street island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| And that's been a kind of a custom for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| but every once in a while there's a kind of a raid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| and all of a sudden you get a ticket on your door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| telling you you've messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| So we need to be clear about where things go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| And I don't know how we do that signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| a little poster hanger, occasional handout or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| but we ought to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| If not, are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| And if so, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2620)|

| 0:45:20| Parkside Drive, northeast of Sherlake Lane, from C6 to C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| B. Joe Clayton Applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Mr. Delevaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Yeah, just a quick question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| I know that every time we confront C4, we have kind of the willies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| because it is that outdoor display zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| Now, this is an appropriate use in this case of sale of automobiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| and you have to have a place to put them and folks to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| What happens as the use of that property changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| I assume C4 stays with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| so any other outdoor display use can occur later on downstream from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| The zoning that would be approved would run with the land is the phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| that we use that continues regardless of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Is there any condition you can put on it to have a second look later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| or you just rezone it and take what comes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| I think courts have looked unfavorably on conditioning zoning with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| to time frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| The City Council has the authority to revisit the zoning on any property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| at any time as well as the city administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2805)|

| 0:47:20| And I'm going to take a moment and ask Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| have we missed something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| I believe I have the applicant on Item 9L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2849)|
| 0:47:37| We missed the opportunity to speak when the item came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2857)|

| 0:47:50| We could ask the applicant to say her piece and decide then if we want to reconsider anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| Would counsel like to hear from the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2879)|

| 0:48:40| No one was saying anything, and I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| When you say dead, does that mean it can't be reconsidered again, or what's the issue, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| At the moment, there was not a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| So nobody on council said, I want us to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| So it died because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| We are allowed by Robert's rules to reconsider that decision and vote on it if we choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| So if you or you could reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| Yes, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| But so as of this moment, unless we choose to take further action, your application is dead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| and you would have to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Well, we were trying to make it a commercial lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| because there's a lot of businesses that haven't really been going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| and some have been shutting down and coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| And we're trying to help revitalize that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| And there's, like, a barber shop there that moved into a new spot, redid, you know, its front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| the awning and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| And then across the street, there's been delis and stuff that's coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| We're hoping to see if we can do something and stabilize it more and get more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| There's also apartments and all that kind of stuff going up near the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| the corner that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Down the street, there's a bunch of residential areas coming across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| So maybe help those people out, you know, just to have something, commercial, retail, food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3001)|
| 0:50:13| Any comments or questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| I'd like to ask the young lady, you were talking about serving food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| The original information we had on this was that it was going to be a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Is it a broader business than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Well, this one, yeah, this, if we rezone it, this can be a liquor store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| and then it would open up space for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| Because there's another, like another organization is moving out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| so then we can do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| So the property is bigger than just one storefront is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| Well, no, not this property, but that's the bigger picture we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Oh, adjacent in that same lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Yeah, in that same area, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| So you're trying to, in your view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| is you're trying to spur some kind of commercial development and create opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| Well, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| Mr. Mayor, shouldn't we have a motion to reconsider really in order to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| That would be in order if we wish to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| I'd like to make the motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Reconsider the chair's calling it dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| So motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| And the reason being, you know, when that was going forward a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| I was trying to rack my brain when nobody said anything because we obviously heard this on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| and it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| And so we had time between the first and second reading to hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| And if somebody's heard some things that are negative or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| because as I look down here and see the staff recommendation, the professional staff we pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| they made the recommendation to approve C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| And it's compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| You know, I try to follow our professionals' advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| And, you know, I haven't heard any reason to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| And furthermore, we did hear it on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| So that's my reason for the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Let me say, as a council person, I actually voted against it two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| And my sense is that we have the downtown vessel redevelopment that we're trying to push on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| and that there's an argument to be said that actually this isn't a corner we want to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| We want to develop four or five blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| So, you know, I'm actually not going to second your motion to reconsider for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| But let me see if there's anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| Is this on the question Mr. Bailey has just raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| And if I'm permitted, I'd like to ask Mr. Donaldson to comment how this meshes in with the vessel redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| or did you consider that back at MPC because there is effort to kind of upgrade that area and improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3170)|
| 0:52:59| And quite an extensive plan was done by architects to help us envision a future for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3179)|
| 0:53:10| This intersection of Eddington and Merrillville is more than half a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| probably about a half a mile from the vessel redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| It's one of several intersections along Merrillville Pike that have commercial zoning on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| on the maps that are in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| The corners at Candora and Merrillville also have C3 and C4 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| and the corner at Joe Lewis in Merrillville has C1 zoning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| This particular intersection has C3 on three or four parcels already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3224)|
| 0:53:52| and it's entirely surrounded by industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| That led staff to the recommendation to the planning commission that it was both consistent with the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| the one-year plan and the sector plan, and compatible with the surrounding land uses and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| So the C3 zoning would allow a greater menu of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3250)|
| 0:54:18| and remove some of the constraints that exist to development under the C1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| which is typically used when the commercial zoning is adjacent to residential land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3263)|
| 0:54:32| I noticed the C1 label said neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| and you picture sort of the service businesses right nearby a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| where folks can walk or drive to them and get things done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| without traveling great distances to a major artery or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| What is the difference in C3, would you tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| C3 is titled general commercial and it has a much wider array of allowable land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3293)|
| 0:55:03| and it's different from C1 in that C1 has a maximum building footprint of 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3303)|
| 0:55:13| which tends to control the scale of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| and make it compatible with any adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| It tends to be smaller scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Let me say Mr. Bailey's motion does not yet have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| I see Mr. Grieve's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| Unless you were planning to second Mr. Bailey's motion, unless somebody else is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| I'm going to declare his motion failed for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| And since there is no motion originally made and no motion to reconsider, we have finished with this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3337)|
| 0:55:47| I'm sorry, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| 10A is an appeal by Callaway Oil Company of a decision by the City of Knoxville Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3357)|

| 0:56:31| Mr. Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| Should I say Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| Traditionally in these we've heard from the applicant first before there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| So you're allowed up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3402)|

| 0:56:49| Tommy Hunt, 1313 Turnberry Lane, Maryville, Tennessee, one of the employees for Callaway Oil Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| and one of the landowners in the Callaway Hunt Real Estate LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| The other three are my wife, my brother-in-law and his wife and hopefully our children at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| I'm the fellow that made the mistake to install the electronic price sign over the plastic changeable price sign numerals that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3428)|
| 0:57:20| I received the ordinance from Mr. Scott Brenneman, read it, assumed that electronic message boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| like all the other cities that we're in and we're in ten counties in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| were the reader boards, which you see immediately below the price sign in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| Our price sign faces were cracked and leaking like they had some divots out of the plastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| because you have to take this pole, slam that on the ground with these numbers on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| slam this up and slide it in the tracks and the plastic had cracked and had some holes leaking so it needed replacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3467)|
| 0:57:58| The electric faces that we put in go inside the existing cabinets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| It did not increase the sign space. It did not increase the changeable space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| It's much easier for our employees to change. It's much safer, as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| Having this up in the air when the wind is blowing and the rain is blowing can be dangerous because they do come down on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| and they do turn loose. We have had some employees with lacerations that required stitches changing prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| We also have problems, as in yesterday morning, where these were frozen to the plastic faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| and could not be moved and we could not change prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| Now, our customers didn't fuss, but we were losing about eight cents a gallon until we were able to change some of the prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| until the sun thought out the signs. Even taking a hot water bottle and spraying them did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| I realize that this has been a very sensitive subject for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| and I'm very sensitive to sensitive subjects before council, serving on one myself in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| But I would ask that the council look at this from a business promotion standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| I do think the ordinance is written too broad, including our electric price signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| and the electric message panel inclusion in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| We change our prices typically once a day, possibly twice a day, depending on what neighbors and competition is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| We obviously change it much more frequently than in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| The 250 feet of frontage is a very large parcel when you're talking about commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| of the price and locations of which we would try to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| We are looking at a development in another city with McDonald's and a 3,000 square foot store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| and a 2,800 square foot McDonald's is only going to require 240 feet of frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| and believe me, we won't be trying to buy any more than we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| The 250 feet, in my opinion, is too large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| We are on a corner, I would think, would hope that you would seize fit to approve the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| because we have 350 feet approximately of frontage on the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| and that will allow us to come over then that 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| I realize that some folks think we may be ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| In another life, I had quite a few dealings with pig farms and I can guarantee you that not one of them was scenic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| but I sure enjoyed Honey Baked Ham for Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| And I want to remind the city that the businesses are who pay the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| I was running the total and I didn't know whether to come tonight and ask for the sign variance or ask for a raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| because we pay you $90,000 a year from that one store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| You get three cents a gallon for every gallon of gasoline that we sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| You get two and a half cents of every dollar of every dollar of product that we sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| You get 17 cents of every dollar of beer that we buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| It's paid directly to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| You also get $8,000 in property tax and $250 in personal property taxes per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| which probably will be going up given the budget concerns that all of us face in municipal governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| We don't begrudge that, but we would ask your assistance in being a better business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| We're facing very strict competition coming across the street with Kroger and the new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| They have tools to compete with that we cannot as a small family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| We employ 230 people in the East Tennessee area, approximately 10 to 15 people per store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| We have 30 people in our corporate office in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| We do provide benefits for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| We don't provide pensions, but we do provide 401Ks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| And we do try to take care of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| And this is one way, I think, Commissioner Woodhall, you would find that our employees are very favorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| in their conversations about the sign and appreciate the time you took to come out and visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| And I appreciate the time that you all showed in visiting with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| I would ask you to approve this variance because we do have 350 feet of frontage because we are on a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3721)|
| 1:02:09| We only have the one sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| We did not put up two signs, which we were eligible to do in 1994 when we built the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| I'd like to start by thanking Mr. Hunt for his service as a public official in the city of Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| I certainly can commiserate and understand our roles up here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Secondly, I think you all remember when this language came before us to look at modifying our ordinances regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| changeable price signs that are particularly used in this area by gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| but according to the ordinance could be used by other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| And going back to the previous council that some of my colleagues served on with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| we spent an extensive amount of time looking at these ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| As you recall, we started with digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| and then we narrowed the funnel a little bit to electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| which is what you might see, say, at a Walgreens or a federal credit union or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| And then as those discussions continued, the changeable price signs were added kind of later in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| And I certainly feel that I made an error in not considering the changeable price sign restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| and the amount of street funders necessary to allow those separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| I think the billboards and then the electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| and then the changeable price sign should have been considered separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| However, they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| And so Council Member Hall brought back some language to amend our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| to suggest that we lessen the street fundage less than 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| I think that the current language that we have is punitive, particularly to small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| and particularly, I've said this before, to businesses that want to invest in our center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| Some of our older parcels in the center of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| and certainly this doesn't apply to this parcel necessarily at Cedar Bluff and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| are less than 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| And a business owner who is willing to come in and invest several million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| to revitalize a parcel that's in a blighted area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| that frequently can be the anchor that starts to turn the tide in a block that needs investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| We have talked extensively on this council, particularly the last couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| as we've considered budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| We understand the severity of the budget crunch that's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| and to not value our businesses and the investment that they make in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| and not make the city a welcoming place for businesses large and small I think is a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| However, all that being said, this council chose not to change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| We said 250 feet is the threshold, and I have to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| I can't support a system where we say one thing and do another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| I supported the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| This council voted that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| And for that reason, unfortunately, Mr. Hunt, I cannot support your appeal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| We did have this conversation on the phone, and I hope I explained that this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| If the sentiment of this council has changed on that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| I would certainly support bringing some language back to revisit this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| because I think there are a number of businesses that are being punished by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| They have to special order this old-fashioned technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| It's more expensive than putting in the new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Employees are getting hurt, as Mr. Hunt said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| There just are numerous reasons, in my mind, that this should be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| Let me say we're still – I was next going to ask – I was assuming you had a question, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3923)|
| 1:05:31| So let me hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Do you have a question, Mr. DellaVoppe, for Mr. Hunt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| I could phrase anything as a question, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| I wanted to make a statement, and so I want to honor your –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| Let me hold off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Is there anybody else who wants to speak in favor of the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| And is there anybody who wishes to speak against the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| Ms. Feld, and I think you know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| Please state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| I forgot to sign up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| and I'm here as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| And Scenic Knoxville is opposed to granting this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| It's only been a few months, as Councilor Roddy acknowledged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| it's only been a few months since Council affirmed a minimum frontage requirement of 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3983)|
| 1:06:31| I'm not sure why Callaway Oil didn't obtain the required permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| or why the sign company that produced the installed sign didn't advise that a permit was necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| as it's my understanding that it's the sign company's obligation to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| However, at the Board of Zoning Appeals in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Mr. Hunt stated that he was aware of the recent city council debate over whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| or not to reduce the frontage from 250 feet to 100 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| and I believe that he even stated that he attended one or more of the city council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| when this was being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| So, at the least, he knew that this was an issue of concern and debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| and he knew what the ordinance required, I assume, since he was privy to the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4034)|
| 1:07:21| and he also must have known that he didn't meet the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| Since the city wasn't notified about this sign, you might wonder how the city found out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| I did, too, so I did a little investigating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| and the answer is that a competitor notified the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| and wanted to know why this station was allowed to have a digital price sign when his wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| So granting this appeal, I think, would be extremely unfair to all the business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| who have chosen to be compliant with the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| and granting this appeal would affirm the old adage that it's better to ask forgiveness than permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| In my discussions with council members, I've learned that some may feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| and obviously Mr. Hunt feels, that this sign is justified because it's on a corner lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| and that the two frontages added together meet the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| However, when council passed new restrictions on EMCs in 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| and this was long before the formation of scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| they included a 200-foot frontage requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| Their intent at the time was that all 200 feet be on one street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| Unfortunately, some permits were inappropriately issued after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| by allowing two frontages to be added together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| So to prevent this, when the new ordinance was passed in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| very specific language was inserted stating that all 250 feet of frontage had to be on one street only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4127)|
| 1:08:55| and that street had to be the one which carried the business's address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| So no, it's not okay to add two frontages together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| In order to be granted a variance, a hardship must be proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| Mr. Hunt states that he's concerned about the safeties of his workers, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| There are solutions to this problem, however, other than a digital price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| One solution is to place the price lower on the existing pole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| so the employees don't have to reach so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| And another is to use a monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| These are used very effectively in Farragut and a large number of other communities across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| and scenic Knoxville certainly would like to see Knoxville move toward monument signs for new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4174)|
| 1:09:41| Last time I was here, I told you that the city of Charlotte, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| had won innumerable awards for being an excellent place to conduct business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| even though they have a strict sign ordinance and strive hard to maintain a visually attractive city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| This time, I want to tell you that the town of Farragut, which allows only monument signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| and doesn't allow any digital signs, was recently ranked the second most business-friendly city in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4202)|
| 1:10:09| by the Tennessee Center for Policy Research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| In contrast, the city of Knoxville was ranked 47th out of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| I've had several sign advocates tell me that Farragut is anti-business, but I think that this proves otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| and I'm not suggesting that it's their sign ordinance that got them this ranking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| but certainly what I'm saying is that you can have a strict sign ordinance and also have a business-friendly city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| Neither is scenic Knoxville unfriendly to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| I'm a small business owner myself with my own sign, I might add, legal sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| as are several other board members of scenic Knoxville and numerous members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| In fact, we're pro-business, but we believe that an attractive city is ultimately the most business-friendly city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| I'm afraid we haven't seen the last variants of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| This process is time-consuming for everyone involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| and so I would ask you to please send this to MPC to study the issue of a ban on all new digital price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4265)|
| 1:11:13| A ban would be the fairest policy for all merchants while promoting a visually attractive city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4273)|
| 1:11:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| Is that a question, Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| And you're still not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Mr. Hunt, you are allowed a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| Actually, I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| A question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| Yes, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| This is for Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| What was your reasoning for, I think you mentioned to me that you looked at the surrounding counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| and the ordinances and you were confused about what the cities allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| Why did you go ahead and do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| I read the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Scott, Mr. Brenneman, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| Mr. Brenneman had forwarded the ordinance to me, and I had read it and assumed, incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| that the electronic message boards emit the reader boards, which they do in all the other cities in which we apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| And you'll notice that the electronic reader board at the bottom of the sign has not been replaced with anything electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4325)|
| 1:12:13| It was my mistake in not getting further clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| I do not think that if we were replacing the existing plastic faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| did not think that we needed a permit because there's no additional wiring, no cabinets, nothing mechanical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| What we were doing was taking out two sets of plastic, one on one side and one on the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| and putting the other plastic pieces that have the electronic numbers in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| If you'll notice on the information you have, the replacement faces are about two inches thicker than the existing plastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4358)|
| 1:12:46| So there's nothing structural, mechanical, or electrical that had to additionally be due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| We were essentially making repairs to existing faces, and typically we don't normally have to get a permit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| Mr. Brenneman has been very gracious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| He told me at that time that the ordinance was under consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| and he would delay making a decision for me until that was done because he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| no need for you to take it down and then be allowed to put it back up in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| I came to the Urban Hen Coalition meetings, and these ordinances were postponed at those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| and I did not attend the subsequent, between those two and this one, unbeknownst to me, that it was going to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4398)|
| 1:13:28| I mean, that portion of the ordinance was going to be up for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| Thank you. You do have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| I think the reason that the Roberts Rules of Order includes a motion to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4419)|
| 1:13:46| is that it does allow a body to change its mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| If not, let me go to Mr. Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| Did the company that you used to buy your new sign, did they not mention anything about the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| The company where we bought the sign from is actually located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that manufactures these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4445)|
| 1:14:13| They are a result of four mergers in the sign industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Plastiline obviously being one of the victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| And the sign company that installed it was Nanny Sign and Crane Company out of Maryville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| and they did so at my direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| It is not their fault that the permit was gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| I do not want their name besmirched at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| It would be mine only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Let me go to Mr. DellaVoppe first and then Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| You can sit down, Mr. Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| I want to thank both Mr. Hunt and Ms. Feld for pointing up the issues for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| I thought both speakers were well prepared and well spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| and I think brought the issues clearly to us on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| My inclination is that I don't want to do this piecemeal because I think we invite chopping and snipping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| and doing all kinds of things to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| I have been persuaded somewhat that there is at least some reasoning to allow people to have signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4506)|
| 1:15:16| if they're changeable signs anyway, to be done rationally and with current technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| as long as we're not adding bright lights and distractions and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| On the other hand, I would rather see any decision made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| whether it's to keep the current rule or to adjust it to be made on some type of general basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4529)|
| 1:15:38| rather than on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| I note in the package information that one of the BCA members said that their hands were tied by council's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| and that, frankly, he commented that it seemed insane to him that you couldn't count both road frontages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4549)|
| 1:15:56| but that was up to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| Again, I think we owe it to the citizens of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| if we're going to make decisions about what our city looks like in 5, 10, 15 years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| that we do this in an intelligent way and not piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| So I would rather see us address this, Mr. Hunt, in a way that takes a second look, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4572)|
| 1:16:19| at these types of signs compared to electronic billboards and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| I hate that you're in the middle of that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| but the flip side is I also don't want to reward someone who even mistakenly kind of puts in the wrong thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4585)|
| 1:16:33| and now gets a foothold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| I think the moral hazard is that it's easier to do it and ask for forgiveness later, and we don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| So I do want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| I thought you were respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| I thought you were informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| I thought you made good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Thank you for paying your taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| We're thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| But I think I'd like to see us do this in a controlled and system-wide kind of analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4610)|
| 1:16:57| Mr. Bailey, and then I'll go to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Vice Mayor, and I appreciate your comments, Councilman Della Vopi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| because it does bring it back front and center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| and I appreciate Councilman Roddy reviewing the whole history of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| because we had quite a long process originating on the digital billboard and then the EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| and then this was added and then taken out and reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| And Councilman Hall, I think we voted on it and passed it at one point to lower the frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4637)|
| 1:17:27| and then it was postponed, and then it went back to the MPC, and it never really happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| And I hope everyone's had a chance to look at Ms. Cash's review of the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| I wish she was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| I know Mr. King's here, and he's got a great mind and great recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| But Ms. Cash is a real independent thinker and has great recollection of what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4664)|
| 1:17:53| And I would like to have talked to her about this because my recollection of these price signs were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4673)|
| 1:18:01| it just went through with the rest of the whole time-consuming, and we were all tired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4681)|
| 1:18:11| and I don't think it got the proper review, and I think we ought to come back and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| And it's unfortunate that Mr. Hunt's here, and we really haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| But I did want to just ask Councilman Palmer, did we not do some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| or did you do a review, some sort of an analysis, polling council members on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| I did, and the polling revealed that council wanted to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| and they wanted to reduce the frontage actually to 175 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| That was the result of the poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| When it came back to council and we had the discussion, we left it at the majority vote to keep it at 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| And I have a number of concerns, but continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| And I just want to say that I voted to ban EMCs, and I don't think that signs are attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4737)|
| 1:19:05| I don't think any of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| It's just a matter of taste and opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| And I happen to think that these are a lot cleaner and they look better than the old ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| And he's mentioned there's a lot of safety issues and a lot of labor issues and business issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| And here again, Councilman Roddy made a great couple of comments on being pro-business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4762)|
| 1:19:30| and I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| I'm one that, you know, here we have a process to get a variance, and it was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4772)|
| 1:19:41| And the reason it was denied is Councilman Del Vopi said, Mr. Van Beek said that their hands were tied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| and it was up to city council because we were the ones that framed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| And so it is in our lap, and I think that we ought to, we've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| We've got a variance, and I think there are numerous reasons to support the appeal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4796)|
| 1:20:04| And then again, I think we owe it to ourselves to go back and see if our sentiments have changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| or to review how we feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| But I'm going to support it because a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| I haven't heard any opposition except from Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| and I've supported and worked with Councilman Greaves through that whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| And I think we are doing the right thing, but I think when it comes to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| it does hurt small businesses in areas that we're trying to bring back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| and it can spur growth and development and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| But there was no opposition from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| You know, he's got the county surrounding him, both areas, and it's allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| so he's really sort of at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| Formerly, we could count both streets, and that kind of got thrown out without a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| And this is a busy two streets, and so there's plenty of frontage if you consider both the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4859)|
| 1:21:11| And so I'm going to support it, and I would urge my colleagues to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| And I would also recommend that we send something back to the NPC to review this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4876)|
| 1:21:24| or we need to have a workshop or some sort of discussion going forward on the issue as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| I have my light on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| I'm going to do a chair thing and a non-chair thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| We have extensively, those of us who have been on Council seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| have talked a whole lot about signs, so much so that we're sick of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| And it is going to keep coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| I think just the piece of advice I'd give is I don't think this is a big enough issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| that just sending something to NPC and saying, hey, let's do something different, isn't the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| I think this is one that the idea of a workshop or a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| or something that looks more extensively at signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| and I think before we decide to do it, we've got to have the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| This is not going to be something we're going to get done in six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| This is probably something in the big picture that isn't going to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| before the terms of the three of my colleagues that end this year leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| But I think it is worth pursuing at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| Now, my chair thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| There's not a motion on the floor at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| and we generally are loose about having discussions with not being a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| So I'm going to call on the lights that I see now, but after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| if there's not a motion, I'm going to cut off discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| So we go to Ms. Palmer and then to Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Well, could I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Please, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Well, I move to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| And there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Okay, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Does that mean approve the content or just that the appeal be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| No, approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| It's the approval of the actual request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| I'm familiar with this sign because I go by that intersection fairly frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| So I have seen the old and the new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| and believe me, the new is much less obtrusive than the old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| So from an aesthetic point, I really like the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| I was quite taken with the fact that there were no neighbors who complained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| other than a competitor who would also like a different sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| and either needs to move to the county where he can have it or stay in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| I'm quite taken the fact that this company is a responsible employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| They're providing jobs, providing some health care benefits, which is really crucial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| and a 401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| I'm also quite taken with the fact that you pay your taxes well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| And I've come on my year in council to understand the significance of revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| and I really get that now very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| This was a location where we could have two signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| which would be much less attractive than the single sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| No neighbors have complained about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| This was generated by someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| And, again, like Councilman Bailão,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| I'm concerned that this is an anti-business message we're sending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| We definitely need to put our thinking hats on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| and revisit the different kinds of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| And I'm not a big digital billboard fan by any means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| but I do think that signs such as the ones at gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| we need to isolate them from some of the other kinds of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| I will be supporting the appeal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| Mr. Greve, and then Mr. Della Voppe, and then myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Well, I think council, I think I've probably been dealing with signs as long as council has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| having been president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| And I find it very difficult to understand that we have a city close by that does not allow these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5079)|
| 1:24:49| and yet at the same time look where they rank as far as being pro-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| And as the individual from Scenic Knoxville said, you know, I'm definitely not against business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| If anything, I'm pro-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| But I also am very much concerned about the look of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| And I think that what concerns me about this particular situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| and it goes back to what you were saying, Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| is that we do need to review at some point our signage situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| and really understand what the technology is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| And what I think should happen is that this particular appeal should be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| because during this time that we're going to be looking at signs or having a workshop or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| we could have many more folks coming to us and asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| And because we've done this once, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| how are you going to turn down someone else who's going to be here in two weeks or three weeks or four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| And so I really think you're really opening a floodgate by going ahead and approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| This is not to say that we don't look into signage throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| I know you and I have had several discussions about not only the price fixing signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| or the price changing signs but other signs in terms of what's happening all over our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| And so I really cannot support this in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| because I think that we're setting a precedent by then allowing in the next six weeks, eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| two months or however long the rest of you folks are on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| We know how long it took to take care of digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| And I just think that this is a real mistake to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| And I think that council, that you folks that were here and the former council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| spent an awful lot of time reviewing and coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| And I think we should stand by what was finally settled on until we do have a chance to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| So I will be denying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Yes, I've already I think given my main comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| I just want to say I think even the proponent's statement reveals the flaw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| in trying to approve this appeal as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| And that is there is a neighboring business that is a competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| How can we give one of them an advantage and then the other one we tell them no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| I think we ought to have a uniform standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| I think we have to take a hard look on what our city should look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| Are there better signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| I'm not against technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| I think we ought to use it every way we can to minimize work injury and be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| But I think doing this piecemeal just creates mischief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| And I apologize to Mr. Hunt, but I'd rather see us make an intelligent system-wide decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| rather than Band-Aids everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| I'm going to be opposing it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| And I think Ms. Roddy summed it up really well at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| We've dealt with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| We've passed a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| And I don't think we should govern by variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| So I think we should stick with the law we've adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| I think we've found someone that's an upstanding citizen in the community, a business leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5268)|
| 1:27:56| and he's from Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| And I think he's made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| And we've had that occur on numerous occasions where somebody has done something without a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| and they have to come back through some process like this and ask us to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| And I think people make honest mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| And we've had a number of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| And so I think this is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| I do agree with the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| We need to review the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| And I don't think it would take that long because, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| Councilman Palmer went through a process and it came back pretty solidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| that we support reducing the frontage issue for priceable signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5310)|
| 1:28:39| And, but anyway, and I wanted to ask to sort of remedy, to ask the legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5319)|
| 1:28:46| I wish Mr. Swanson was here, were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| but are there any things that we could do to put this on hold in the way of a moratorium on variances for priceable signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5329)|
| 1:29:00| What am I trying to say here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| Changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| I think in the nature of the way things come to Council, I think it would be a self-enforcing moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| In other words, I think it would be something that would be potentially voted on each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| and every time that issue came up before Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| I'm not sure you can do one across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| Well, here again, I think that that's why we have this process in place to get a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| And I think this is an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| And I think we ought to consider really what our true position is on the overall issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| and also agree that we're going to move forward on the overall variance, I mean the frontage issue as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| So I would encourage my colleagues to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| I would just like a clarification from Council Lady Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| How many people did you actually poll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| I polled all nine members of Council, both electronically and then I think we did it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| And I got, I believe it was, eight responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| It was at the time that you were otherwise engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| But I do think I got a response from you, if I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| I see no lights right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| My understanding is that a variance like this is normally given for a hardship based on peculiar restrictions of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5423)|
| 1:30:31| or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| And I don't, I mean, this place had a sign with these old-fashioned numbers for years, apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5433)|
| 1:30:40| and I don't think you can prove a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| I don't think it falls within the technical letter of what a BZA exception would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5443)|
| 1:30:51| I think for that reason alone we should deny it because it doesn't meet the legal test of what a hardship is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| You know, if you, calling the question involves a vote on calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| There are no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| So if you will withdraw your motion to call the question, I will go ahead and call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| I will withdraw, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| Mr. Bailey, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| Mr. Hunt, do you see any hardships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| If I might interject, to get your skin off the table and mine too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5483)|
| 1:31:33| you could table this motion, postpone the motion for the approval or denial of the variance until after the work session is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5493)|
| 1:31:41| And then my legal course for the city is stayed until you all make your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5501)|
| 1:31:49| And I thought of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| And I think that could be an option that we could consider is that we just table this until we look at the overall issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5512)|
| 1:32:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| I see Mr. DellaVope's light now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| I should not have talked you out of calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| I'm sorry, Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| Mr. DellaVope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| I am fearful that the suggestion is a de facto variance that we're granting because we're going to spend however many weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| or months wrestling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| I don't think that's fair to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| I think if we're going to give him a variance, we might as well give it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| But I think a de facto variance, we just turn the other way and let him keep his sign, is not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| It proves that it's better to race ahead and beat the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| I think that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| Well, I would agree to a postponement so that we can have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| I do not think it's going to take counsel nearly as long to make a decision about these price changer signs as it did past sign issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5562)|
| 1:32:50| We've already had a preliminary finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| I think it would be, we're talking about fairness, and I think it would be unfair to Mr. Hunt to have him take his sign down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| put back in the sign that is manually changed, and then we come back and say, well, 150 feet of frontage is what is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| So then he takes the manual sign down and puts this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| So I have a great deal of faith in this counsel that it will not take us the rest of our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| or two or three counsels from now to reach this to make some kind of a decision one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| If we come to a conclusion that the frontage should be reduced and he's within those parameters, he would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5603)|
| 1:33:32| Maybe we would come to the conclusion that it's total frontage, not just on the street where your mailbox is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| So there are a number of variables that would support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Oh, Ms. Roddy, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| I'm seeing my lights wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| I guess I'm making an observation about this body, and that is in our prior meeting when we convened as the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| we had a number of items in front of us where we were concerned that there might be extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| And as is our custom on that board, we bent over backwards time and time again to try to accommodate those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5643)|
| 1:34:10| that were coming before us to give them every opportunity to develop their business plan, to get open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| to overcoming any obstacles that they might have in opening their new business or obtaining their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5656)|
| 1:34:24| And it would seem that in this case tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| if supporting a postponement allows this business person to do that while maintaining our aversion to offering variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5667)|
| 1:34:36| and, as Vice Mayor Becker said, sort of governing by variance, that might be the best of both worlds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| So if Council Member Bailey is intending to make a motion to postpone, I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| However, I would think it might need to be a lengthy postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| Currently, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| I'll make the motion to postpone for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| Ninety days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| I personally think that's a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| I mean, what's going to happen when we have additional people come forward in the next 90 days that want to sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| Or those folks, the competitor down the street who calls up the sign person and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| hey, make sure my sign's up in the next four weeks so that I can have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| Are we then going to do the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| Are we going to say, well, gee, you know, you went ahead and put up a sign, and so, therefore, we're going to make it legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| And I think that we've got rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| We've got variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| We have different ways of doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| And I think we're really going off track by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| Seeing no other likes, the motion is to postpone for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| I heard, did I hear three ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| Do we want a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| We'd like a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Madam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| Councilman Greve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| The motion, then, is to approve the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Mr. Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| At the risk of making you crazy, I wanted to read you a very short paragraph from Article 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| Administration and Enforcement of the Zoning Requirements under Section 2, Variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| The purpose of the variance is to modify the strict application of specific requirements of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5798)|
| 1:36:45| in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| or other exceptional physical conditions whereby strict application would result in practical difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| or unnecessary hardship which would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| The variance shall only be used where necessary to overcome some obstacle which is preventing the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| from using his property as the zoning ordinance intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| And I think that if you read the law behind this, it's exceptional cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| This place had a sign with these kind of stick-em-on letters, so it's not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5840)|
| 1:37:27| He's been doing it, and I think that we ought to stick to the letter of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Seeing no other lights, all those in favor of the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| An aye vote is voting in favor of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| So all those in favor of the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Does anybody want to roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| We feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| I heard two ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| So motion is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Motion fails to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| 11A is a resolution approving the issuance of a certificate of compliance to Eastown Package Store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| relative to its application to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| for a license to operate a liquor store in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| And the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| 11B is a resolution honoring and expressing appreciation to Mayor and Governor-elect Bill Haslam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| for his outstanding legacy of achievement and years of dedicated service as Mayor of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5901)|
| 1:38:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| Well, Mr. Bailey, and I have a comment myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| You know, last couple of weeks ago was his last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| and I think some of us didn't really recognize this, so we thought it was appropriate to put forth a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| And I just wanted to say that I think that his legacy really with the city is integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| and it's really because of the hard work and dedication that went forward in really interacting with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| and having the public processes and the dialogue and all the work on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| before the votes come before city council, and that really means integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| And I think so it's the manner in which the city's gone about its business in the last seven years is a great credit to the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5947)|
| 1:39:16| now the Governor-elect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| And I wanted not to take away from the Governor-elect, but during the councilman's earlier in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5957)|
| 1:39:25| I wanted to mention that we had a couple of dedications, and one of them was for Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| And we've dedicated the pavilion on the market square as the Dr. Lyons Pavilion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| And why I want to tie this in is because when somebody on behalf of the administration had to go before the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5977)|
| 1:39:46| and take on the tough crowds, it was Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| And he did it, and he did it in an honorable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| So I just want to throw that in, and I do want to say that I really believe the way that over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| Mayor Haslam's legacy is integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| I want to say my understanding is that Bill Haslam will be at the special call meeting on January 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6003)|
| 1:40:10| I think what will happen is he will start that meeting and then resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| So we will have an opportunity to have him at one more meeting, and we can give him the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| If we're mad at him, we can have me read it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| So we can think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Well, that was one thing I was going to ask, Mayor, is that we will have the opportunity, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| in order to read the resolution to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| And I also want to piggyback on what Councilman Bailey had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| He and I had a discussion about this, and I do think it's integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| But I think also that Bill also was able to surround himself with good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| He had a good team of people, not only Dr. Lyons, but also Larry Martin and the rest of his directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| And so the resolution, yes, it's really for Bill, but I think it's also for his whole team that he had put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| So I just want to mention that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| And thank you to Bill and his team of workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| Northern Lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| And the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| 11E is the resolution, adopting a procedure for selection of an acting mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| I'd like to propose an amendment to the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| and I have a handout that I'd like to give that instead of me reading, go ahead and hand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| You want to walk to the other side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6097)|
| 1:41:47| Do you have any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| Here's an extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| Everyone have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6114)|
| 1:42:02| Mr. Mayor, on Section 6 and Section 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| I'd like for discussion and also to possibly add if you'll notice in Section 6 where we talk about the voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6127)|
| 1:42:15| and looking at Robert's Rules of Order and some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| it's interesting to see how this particular situation is handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| And my recommendation is if you'll look at the second sentence in Section 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| in the second round or any subsequent round of voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| if no member receives a total of five votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| no candidate or candidates receiving any number of votes shall be dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| except by the request of the candidate to be dropped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| and council shall proceed immediately to the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| And in Section 7, if at any point during the voting process following a third round of voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| the presiding officer determines that the voting is deadlocked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| the presiding officer shall declare a deadlock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| and absent a vote of majority of the members of city council to the contrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| the process shall recommend as set forth in Section 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| We actually have somebody signed up to speak, and I apologize for not noticing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| Do you mind if we allow that person to speak and then I come back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| I apologize, Mr. Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| I saw that you were down on this one and missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| Thank you, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| I appreciate the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| Ron Peabody, 625 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| You know, there's been a lot written about this process that you're about to undertake in local press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| quite a bit written about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| I'd kind of like to actually like to ask a question of the Deputy Law Director, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| You know, what provision in the charter have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| or your office identified that actually allows this body to take this action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6233)|
| 1:44:02| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| The council, it's up to the council, in accordance with the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| to make the determination as to how the acting mayor is chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| Beyond that, it's a legislative decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| and the law department is really not in a position to offer advice to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| legal advice to council on that particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| We would defer that to Mr. Swanson, the special counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| I guess my question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| I understand your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| The charter lays out the rules, the city of Knoxville charter lays out the rules for how this process takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6276)|
| 1:44:45| Robert's Rules of Orders and suspending the rules of Robert's Rules of Orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| my understanding, don't actually allow this body to change the charter without a vote of the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6291)|
| 1:44:59| And that's what my key question here is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| My understanding is that in order to provide this resolution and to approve it, you know, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6302)|
| 1:45:15| it actually looks like you're or this body is attempting to supersede the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| and take that power on itself to basically to deprive the voters of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6322)|
| 1:45:30| their rights under the charter to vote on charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| Because, quite frankly, this, as written, will amend the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6333)|
| 1:45:41| Are you finished, Mr. Peabody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| And, again, the last time you came up, we had that argument about whether you were allowed to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| and I determined you wouldn't, and now I let you allow you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| I should stick to my policies and say that you're not actually allowed to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| But I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| And when you're finished, I can deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| And I can answer your question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| Yes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| I'd like the chance for a rebuttal, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| And, again, by council rules, and I apologize, I just allowed you to ask Mr. Mills a question that I shouldn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| If somebody asks you a follow-up question, you're allowed to rebut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| But council rules allow you to make statements and not be a member of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| Then I would like to say something else before you proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| You know, as I learned earlier in the year through the process that I undertook with the city in regards to TYP choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| and our efforts to provide or to put forth two ballot referendums, petition for ballot referendums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| and the subsequent melee that followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| My concern here is simply that it appears to me and, quite frankly, many others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| as has also been written in the press locally, that the action you're about to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6413)|
| 1:47:00| this board is about to or this council is about to take, actually is going to result in superseding the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6420)|
| 1:47:08| And my concern here is simply as a citizen of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| I believe what the net result of that will be is basically you're amending this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| is amending the charter to fit your own desires, to come up with a simplified way to solve the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6440)|
| 1:47:28| to replace or to appoint an interim mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| This process that is written in this resolution in no way reflects what is currently in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| and has been covered extensively in the media over the last two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| And I believe that if you proceed with this, really in anything near its current, really this resolution at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6463)|
| 1:47:51| really what you're doing is you're superseding the charter and you are denying the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| the voting citizens of Knoxville, the right to vote on a charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| which my understanding is this board does not have the authority to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| this council does not have the authority to do under the laws and the governance of our city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| Let me just deal with that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| The charter actually requires us to elect an interim mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| Council, the charter provides that council operates by Robert's Rules of Orders unless we adopt other rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| We are currently adopting other rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| This is a very clear process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| We adopt rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| We amend rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Usually we do it on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Usually we do it when somebody is speaking and, say, want to suspend the rules to allow more people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| We do that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| We're doing it a little more formally this time because this time it's an important issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| and we want to be clear what the rules are before we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| So that's why this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| Now, Mr. Greave, I cut you off to allow public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Let me go back to you and your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| I think it might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Do you have the charter in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| In terms of it might be good to go ahead and read exactly what it says in terms of the election of the acting mayor by this council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6546)|
| 1:49:13| Vice Mayor, can I just say something before you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| I think it's fair to say that what we've heard from Mr. Peabody has been duly noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| and we'll go back to our general counsel and have what we've been told reinforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| What would you like me to read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| Well, apparently, let's just be clear that it's this body that elects the acting mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| A vacancy, I'll read the entire section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| This is section 705.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| That's not the entire section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| A vacancy in the office of mayor shall be filled by special election called by the council as soon as practical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| but in any event no longer than 90 days from the call for such election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| provided, however, that in the event the vacancy in the office of mayor should occur within 10 months of the next regular election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6598)|
| 1:50:05| the vacancy shall be filled at such regular election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| Any such primary person shall be within 10 days after the vacancy in the office of the mayor is created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6610)|
| 1:50:18| by a majority vote of city council, by a majority vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| by a majority vote, city council shall elect one of its members to fill the position of acting mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| who shall remain as acting mayor until the position of mayor is filled by election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| Just wanted to be sure we were on the record with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| Can I continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| What I'm looking at here is one of the things that I addressed the last time that we talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| that there is that possibility of us going several rounds with individuals having only one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6647)|
| 1:50:53| And I think there ought to be the opportunity that we continue to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| just the way Robert's Rules of Order says, to where, you know, after several rounds of voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| an individual that maybe only continues to get one vote would have the opportunity to drop out themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| instead of dropping the low three or the low four in a situation like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| And I think that's what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| And so that's why I'm requesting that we look at the words that I've added into this on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| Is that a motion to adopt your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| That would be a motion to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| For clarification, is it the red line and the strikeouts on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| That would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| So there is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| Ms. Palmer has her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Well, I am concerned that Robert's Rules of Order is what we worked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| and we could continue to work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| I think that by saying at the second round the lowest number is eliminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| we're kind of anticipating, which is probably going to be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| but I do think that we need to maximize our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| We're anticipating a problem that may not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| There could be somebody in the first round who has eight votes or six votes or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| and there could be six people who have one and a number of other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| So I think that if we do not amend this, we will be anticipating a problem that may never occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6734)|
| 1:52:22| I'm also thinking that it's possible that if we eliminate everybody with the lowest number of votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6742)|
| 1:52:29| and I think people will self-select themselves out, if we eliminate them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| we could end up electing someone to be mayor that really only initially had three people support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| And that worries me because that may not be the real will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| We may have a clear-cut favor among council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| We may have ‑‑ this may take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| It's the biggest decision that this council will have to make, and we need to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| So for that ‑‑ among those reasons, I'll be supporting this change that Councilman Grave is making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6776)|
| 1:53:06| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| Ms. Palmer, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| Are we ready to vote on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| All those in favor of the amendment say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| I heard two noes and seven ayes, so this is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Vote on it as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| Now voting as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| One comment on Section 3, where it says council discussion after people have made a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6823)|
| 1:53:55| And we're already going to have a general discussion in Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6835)|
| 1:54:02| And I'm going to make a motion that the council discussion in Section 3 would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6842)|
| 1:54:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| I'm going to speak back and say it is very hard to keep this council from discussing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| Don't look at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| And if you all vote to approve this, I'm not going to let you discuss things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| There is a motion to not allow discussions in Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6870)|
| 1:54:36| Is there discussion about that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Because as I read Section 3, after council has generally discussed, I guess, what we want this mayor to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6882)|
| 1:54:50| the qualities or experience or whatever, and then the recorder goes around and asks who wants to be the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| People say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| I understood in Section 3 that would be a time for each of those people who want to be the interim mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6898)|
| 1:55:06| to make a statement about his or her qualifications or his or her reasons or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| I didn't see it as an extended discussion of Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| Maybe I didn't see well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| Could someone help me out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| As a person who drafted this, the sense there was that in Section 1, we don't know who's running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6923)|
| 1:55:29| so we're making general statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| In Section 3, we know who's running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| People are making statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| And I can imagine somebody who's announced they're running saying something and somebody saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| well, what do you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| Are you going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| I would imagine some level of discussion there that would be, do you intend to do X, Y, or Z?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| That's why this was added to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| But if council does not want discussion there, that is council's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| I would be interested to know from Council Member Brown the reasons behind deleting the discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| And maybe I missed it if you said that earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| but I guess I'm thinking to amplify on what Mayor Becker said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| once we know which council members would like to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| then it seems appropriate to be able to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| As mayor, will you support doing this with the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| As mayor, will you support doing this with sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| As mayor, will you support X, Y, Z?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| I think that will be an important component in each person formulating their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| And I'm not sure that all of those position statements will be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| in the individual's introductory position statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| That could be a point very well taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| but I'm thinking in terms of the general discussion that those matters will probably already come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7012)|
| 1:57:00| and would move the process along a little smoother if we just then make a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7020)|
| 1:57:07| those who are entering their names, and then go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| That's how I'm thinking of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| I'm thinking in the general discussion in Section 2 that most of those things that you just mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7033)|
| 1:57:20| would already be discussed in general, but maybe they need to be discussed individually as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7040)|
| 1:57:27| I could be wrong on that, but that's just my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| Does that clear up any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| I think, though, the way I'm reading this is that the general questions, for me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| won't cover a specific question that I might want to ask a candidate for interim mayor regarding the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7061)|
| 1:57:49| for example, and how they intend to govern in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| So I guess I would like to see continuing allowing some discussion in Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7074)|
| 1:58:02| Mr. Delivante.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| Yeah, I just wanted to join in with Ms. Roddy on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| I think that this is important enough a decision that we need to be clear when someone says something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7087)|
| 1:58:14| understand their meaning and we should be allowed to question it, clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| We're trying to do the best we can in picking an interim mayor until the voters get to go to the poll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| and pick the next four-year mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| So I think a discussion is a healthy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| The motion is to delete the discussion in Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7112)|
| 1:58:37| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| I heard a pretty convincing no on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| Does anybody want to ask for a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| Any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| Mr. Delivante.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| I do want to make a comment, and I respect Mr. Peabody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| and certainly his right to speak to these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| I think we have acted with advice of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| We have read carefully what our charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| We are trying to act in the best interest of the citizens in undertaking a process that's difficult but important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7154)|
| 1:59:24| By not having an election where the term is ten months or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| it's obviously intended to avoid all of the time-consuming and cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| maybe a quarter of a million dollars that that would incur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| For a result that really is not going to be very effective by the time you pull off an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| there will be a new mayor ready to sit in the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| And so, Ron, while I respect your comments, I think we're in keeping with the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| and certainly this body has the power to set its own procedures to act effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7187)|
| 1:59:52| and we're doing that, and we're doing it with the advice of our own counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| I think we're right on the money in terms of acting properly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| And it's a tough situation, but we're going to make the best of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| and we're going to do the best for the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7206)|

| 2:01:16| Seeing no light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Yes, I guess Mr. Lyons is batting for the rest of us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7279)|
| 2:01:24| I understand that what we're doing is spending roughly $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| it's $394,000 and some change, to have a stop-loss insurance process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| that essentially allows us to cover some of the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| and overall liability so that it doesn't get out of hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| if we experience more illness than we anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| In other words, we're hedging our bets so that we have a ceiling on our exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| I believe that's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| but I think as much as I appreciate the opportunity to pinch hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| I'm going to step out of the box and turn it over to Gary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| who's going to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| Gary, this is the city's risk and benefits manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| Yes, there are actually two forms of insurance in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| One is specific stop-loss that any one claim would be stopped at $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7328)|
| 2:02:16| and the insurance would take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| And there's also aggregate stop-loss that a little over $15 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| if it exceeded that in an aggregate, then it would stop there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| So essentially we have the city taking on some of the risk of the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| of this health care activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| but buying insurance should it get greater than our anticipated amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| so that we're not with an unlimited exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| That's the goal, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| Seeing no other lights, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7363)|

| 2:03:16| 11I is a resolution authorizing the mayor to approve change order number 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| between the City of Knoxville and Southern Constructors, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| for additional services associated with the Blunt Avenue Reconstruction Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| in an amount not to exceed $82,542.75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| for a new contract price of $1,785,125.52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7419)|
| 2:03:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| Mr. King, was some of this money going to be reimbursed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| Is this the project that KUB is going to reimburse some of the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| Approximately, I think it's $19,000 will be reimbursed by KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| and that's related to the waterline construction that they ask us to include in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| I think in addition to that, I wanted to ask Mr. Hill a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| and that is that this is the fifth change order under this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| I know we have discussed this, but what we have, as I understand it, is some unforeseen circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7456)|
| 2:04:23| whether it's subgrade conditions or some of the other surrounding things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| concerning electrical items and utility ducts that we have to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| So this is an increase to the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| but it's to cover things that weren't anticipated on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| I think in some cases, and Steve can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| we actually had to tie into existing topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| existing points on both the east and west ends of Blount Avenue with Hawthorne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| and as the approach up to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| So all of those, I think, had some conditions that could not have been foreseen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| and I think we also feel we could have coordinated a little bit better with KUB on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| Yes, and I think anyone that has an older house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| that's torn into the walls to do some remodeling knows that sometimes it isn't as you anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| so you run into costs that maybe you couldn't predict on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| The only concern I have, and I don't know if Boyce is still here or not, but I guess he's gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| but we have several of these large construction contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| and it may be inevitable because of the nature of construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| but I hate to see, you know, we fight hard to get a low bidder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| and then the contract creeps up 15 or 20 percent by the time we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| But I know we're doing the very best we can, and I appreciate your effort in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| But I'd like to see us have competitive bid contracts that we kind of stick close to the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| but this is unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| Well, I mean, there actually are some very good answers Mr. McCain could give on why we do what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| and how it's effective, but we don't need to go into that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101228?start=7556)|
