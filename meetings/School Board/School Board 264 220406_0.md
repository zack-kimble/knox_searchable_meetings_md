| 0:02:33| the Consent Agenda, which is a rental agreement for Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=153)|

| 0:02:41| Are there any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| Do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| So a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| President Thomas, I think we have a special recognition tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| Thank you, Madam Chair, and as you all know, this is one of my favorite items on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| each time we meet, and I appreciate the chance to recognize one of our outstanding administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Rob Spies, and Rob's with us tonight, is the principal of Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| He was recently selected by the Tennessee Association of Secondary School Principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| as the 2022 East Tennessee Principal of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| Dr. Spies is a former assistant principal at Austin East, Fulton, and Ellen in STEM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| and is also the former principal of Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| He was named principal of HVA in 2019 and has done an outstanding job leading the Hawk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| In fact, you may remember that in December, Dr. Spies and several members of the HVA community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| appeared before us to receive recognition as a Special Olympics Unified Champion School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| which is a terrific honor in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Dr. Spies is a strong and creative leader, and this recognition is well-deserved, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| please join me in recognizing Dr. Rob Spies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=237)|
| 0:04:24| You have coordinated these dresses for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| It looks like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| It's going to get really scary if we start coordinating our wardrobes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| I usually match with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| This is so nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| This is so nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=279)|
| 0:04:53| Ms. Coatney, do you want to start our regular agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=293)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Item 6, Consent Agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| Motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Item 7A, Approved First Reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy B-110, Method of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| Election of Officers, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| A motion by Ms. Owen, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| I'd like to make a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| It's reflective of the paper that you have at your tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| This is very similar to the wording that I shared with the board on Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Mr. Dupler has kindly reviewed it and made some slight changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| But this would be suggested wording for line 6 on page 1 after the sentence ending with the word board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=355)|
| 0:06:04| It states, prior to the annual meeting in September to elect officers, board members will be asked to state their interest to serve as the chair and or vice chair for the upcoming year at the August work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=364)|
| 0:06:14| Board members who do not express their interest at the August work session will remain eligible for nomination and consideration by the board at the annual meeting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| And again, the only intent of this policy change is so that way the board as a whole can understand where the interest lies to serve in those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=382)|
| 0:06:31| and have some time to consider that as we look to vote at our September meeting instead of all that occurring at the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Yes, and I did watch the meeting even though I wasn't here on Monday, so I was aware of him introducing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| My only thought is if you're going to do this, I would also, and this won't affect me, but I would say also if people want to nominate people, this would be the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=407)|
| 0:06:59| And then it gives everybody a month to either see who has an interest, because otherwise it seems very awkward that the self-nominations happen at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| and then you would nominate people, like if I were to nominate you, I would wait until the next meeting to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| So it seems like I can see doing it a month ahead of time to kind of give everybody time to think about it and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| But I think if you did one for self-nominations and the other one the other way, I think that could be awkward, would be my only thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| I like your idea, and I was actually thinking through that today, how to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| I think it might be better to shift to say board members will be asked to state their interest and or make nominations for those to serve, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=452)|
| 0:07:41| But I agree to do it all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| I would object to having nominations in August because there will be several years where board members won't be seated at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=469)|
| 0:08:01| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I would agree with Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| I mean, I think half the time board members, you know, every other year we're going to have that issue, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| Am I right in saying that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Every other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| So I think that what I would prefer is to do, you know, ask if board members, if you want to be made aware of which board members would and wouldn't want to be considered or willing to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=495)|
| 0:08:27| perhaps in, you know, prior to our meeting, maybe the week prior to our meeting, it be sent to Ms. Coatney and she could route it through the law department and be sent to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=507)|
| 0:08:37| I don't know if we can do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| That would be a question for you, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| But I don't really like the idea of discussing it in August when we would then be every other year have a board change because you have a new board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=522)|
| 0:08:53| When you have one new board member, you have a new board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| So that would occur every other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| So the best way to do it would be to have, you know, a publicly noticed meeting and then whoever wants to express interest say it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=544)|
| 0:09:14| So from that aspect, Mr. Watson's policy change is the proper one to make if this board wants to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=554)|
| 0:09:23| I mean, this board can keep the policy as is or accept this policy change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| Now, as far as nominations and seconds, then I would just caution the board that you could get into trouble there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=567)|
| 0:09:37| by trying to make that ahead of time basically instead of at the September meeting when at that point, I mean, who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=577)|
| 0:09:46| As you say, there could be new members coming on the board that you may want to nominate, but you've already nominated, you know, a current member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=586)|
| 0:09:54| So that could be confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| But certainly just expressing interest, no problem with that if that's the way this board wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=596)|
| 0:10:07| Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Mr. Dupler, should we also add clarifying language that new members would still be eligible if they were not in that August meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=609)|
| 0:10:19| Yes, Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| I mean, that's for the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| I mean, yes, if that's what the board wants to do, that's not a problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| And again, like we talked about Monday, I keep wanting to say last week, but Monday, you know, new board members that have not been sworn in can certainly reach out on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=627)|
| 0:10:45| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Yes, and I also see an awkwardness with the August because I do, and I guess, can I just ask Mr. Watson a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=647)|
| 0:11:00| Is the purpose of you doing it having time to think about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Because I guess I'm not really understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| I think the August to me is awkward because, as we're saying every other year, you have a whole set of people, like I'll be here in August, but I won't be part of the September meeting and there will be a whole new set of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=666)|
| 0:11:20| And then I do think the different, and the only reason I brought it up because I think it's kind of awkward to bring up people self-nominating and then other people nominating them at two different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=680)|
| 0:11:31| But the other thing I can't remember is how do we do it with a special called meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| Is it when we do a work session or is it before the voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Do we just have a special called meeting before our regular work meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| Because my thought almost would be in September at the work session do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| Have the nominations at the work session and have a discussion of people but a vote not to take place until a couple of days later if the purpose is just to give a little time and notice on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=710)|
| 0:12:01| I know that's only a couple of days, but I think that way you actually have your new board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| And I think even when we say, oh, these people that have been elected and haven't been sworn in, they can nominate themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| Well, I think that would be so awkward to nominate yourself before you truly are in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| So I think that's probably I guess that's what a little bit is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| I kind of want to know sort of your thought behind why you're wanting to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| And I also think that we have some limitations in terms of possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| I mean, the original idea that I brought to the board at our March 23rd meeting was the idea, just like Miss Horne suggested, is that we send names to Terry and through the law department she get them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=749)|
| 0:12:39| And then after speaking with Mr. Dupler, learned that that was not really the possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| So my only intent is for us to know prior to being asked to vote who has interest in that so we can have thoughtful consideration as individual board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| That's the only intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Because I do think it's I don't know of any other institutions that would come together and within 30 minutes nominate and not having been able to have any prior conversation beforehand as individual board members nominate and make a recommendation and vote on the next leaders for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=773)|
| 0:13:13| I mean, Mr. McMillan even referenced at our meeting this past September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| He even said something like there seems like something else is happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| And I want to try to avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| I want to try to avoid situations where it doesn't look clean or above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| And so I think people making their interests known ahead of time allows all of us in good faith to consider those interests and ask ourselves, you know, what do I think about so and so being in this role before we're asked to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=808)|
| 0:13:43| So that's the only that's my only interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| I think the work session two days prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| I actually hate our Monday Wednesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I much prefer the Wednesday Wednesdays that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| But that's a whole nother point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| But I but I think even the Monday prior gives you at least a couple of days to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| And I mean, that's why also in this I put that if somebody doesn't make their interest in that meeting known that it's I'm not seeing it as a formal nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=839)|
| 0:14:08| It's not that they can't be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| It's just at that point, those are the people who said they like to be considered for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| So that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| I don't like the August deal at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| I personally think that we're trying to fix something that I don't see anything wrong with the way it was done prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=875)|
| 0:14:50| And this is no no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| You referenced what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| What it seemed to me to come together really quick at the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| And it's no reflection on the present chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| It just came together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| And I have no doubt that there were some phone calls made, talking and whatnot behind the scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=907)|
| 0:15:19| And that's just part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| That's part of the politics of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| And there are politics involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| I know we all like to be holier than thou and remove all aspects of politics since it's the school and school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=926)|
| 0:15:38| But you just can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| And sometimes it's as simple as somebody finding out who has the votes or, you know, can I live with that person or do I want somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=941)|
| 0:15:57| But I do think you need a little bit of time if you're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| Now, you know, if you want to bring it up and kick it around on Monday prior to the Wednesday meeting, I would think that's the best suggestion that I have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=962)|
| 0:16:17| If you've got to do something with it, I see nothing wrong with leaving it like it is, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=977)|
| 0:16:26| That's just my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Having been through seven of these, and they can be somewhat awkward, but the biggest difference I see is especially in light of the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=992)|
| 0:16:43| if it is effective or not effective, is that the way it currently is, someone has to nominate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1003)|
| 0:16:53| The other way, you self-nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| And I don't know which serves this board better, but there is a big distinction between saying, please, please, I want to be chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1016)|
| 0:17:04| and somebody else saying the qualities in you that feel like you would make a good chair and nominating you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| And then that person always has the ability, and it has been done, to say, no, thank you, I don't want to be considered for this nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| But I think that's something that we're overlooking, is the fact that self-nominating, and that's really what it's coming down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| or being nominated by one of your peers because of the qualities they see in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| Anyway, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| I get the idea of thinking about it, and I think it maybe would avoid some of the issues that Mr. McMillan was talking about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1059)|
| 0:17:47| one of our things, of Monday, it's out there, and then it gives people a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| But I do think I don't like the August because it is just a completely different board that's sitting here doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| So I could support it if it was done on Monday, kind of either whether it's other people nominating you or self-nominating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| and then we vote on the Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| But I do think the August is kind of too muddied with two different sets of boards on every other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| I'm fine with shifting the wording to the work session prior to the meeting on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| and my intent is, I think maybe we're messing with semantics a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| my intent is not that people formally nominate themselves to the exclusion of people nominating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| It's more stating ahead of time that I have interest to serve in this capacity, that I'm available and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| and then if people want to nominate that person or another person at the meeting on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| all that would be fair game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| I don't see this eliminating the possibility of a board member nominating somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| who didn't even express interest at the meeting beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1135)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| I agree that I think that could work, Ms. Fabb, Monday, discuss it and then vote on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| But honestly, I think that it would serve us better to have this policy kind of rewritten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| because you'd basically have to rewrite the first part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| I think we need to have it rewritten and bring it back next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| and that would still give us plenty of time to get it done before September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| So I would be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| I agree with Ms. Fabb's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| I think that, you know, it makes sense because then you have your new board in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| but then you still, the intent of Mr. Watson is still there of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| people have time to know who wants to be nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| So I like that suggestion, Ms. Fabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Just a thought along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Maybe it would be better if on Monday if we just call the roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1201)|
| 0:20:11| and when your name's called either you have interest or possible interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| or you have no interest at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| And I don't think that would take very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| That would give people, you know, 48 hours to think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| to build their support or, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| I have a question for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| If we have a special called meeting to nominate before the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| would we also need a special called meeting before the regular session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| to actually vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| No, because the regular meeting is a voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| so you'd be able to vote at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| So we can nominate at the work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| That's not considered a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Well, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| No, you're not nominating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| As I understand it, you're just expressing interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| The nomination, the second, the voting would all occur at the voting meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Okay, so we have a motion by Ms. Owen and a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| And Ms. Horn, it sounded like you had, Mr. Watson, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I'll just add a clarifying question for Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| The way you asked that, it made me think that maybe you were suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| that we move the special called meeting prior to the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| to make nominations and all that, and then just take the vote two days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| Is that what you were suggesting as a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| I wasn't suggesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| That's what I understood someone to have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Madam Chair, would you state the motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Well, we have a motion to approve the item by Ms. Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| and a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| I know there was another suggestion made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| but were you making a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| So I'm not sure how you would do that, Parliament, in substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Well, I would make a substitute motion to let the law department work on rewording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1343)|
| 0:22:31| the beginning of this policy so that it reflects that this would basically become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| another regular agenda item for our regular session meeting in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| and we would therefore vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| We would discuss it, as you said, without nominations at the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| and then vote during our meeting on our regular meeting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| So if that's a substitute motion, that would be my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| So, question, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| We're not going to do the deal of Monday night versus Wednesday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| Well, it would go back to policy review since we have a little bit of time between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| and was that what you wanted to do, or did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| I did not. I wasn't suggesting policy review because of the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| I would prefer that the law department, I think Mr. Dickson has a good understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| so bring it back to the May agenda so that we could vote on it on first reading in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| and second in June and be finished with it in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| I just have a point of order. I don't really care how we handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| I just want to make sure we're doing it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| I made a friendly amendment and I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| was Ms. Owens supposed to, since she made the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| supposed to do something with that first before we have a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| I really don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| The substitute would override the original motion, but, I mean, Ms. Horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1437)|
| 0:24:06| I think you're asking in your substitute to take into consideration the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| that Mr. Watson has brought forward as well, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| I'm not suggesting we use this language. Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| No, I mean, but to consider that language in rewording the first part of the policy, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| It might be easier to just withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| I think that would be the simplest thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| Yeah, so if I made a substitute motion, I would be happy to withdraw that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| if Mr. Watson would like to withdraw his original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| I meant to withdraw the whole, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Just table the, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| I can do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| So I'll withdraw the original motion and bring it back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Mr. McMillan, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Well, I guess if we're going to do away with it, we can wait until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| I was going to make just a simple motion to do what we had talked about Monday night versus Wednesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1507)|
| 0:25:20| and do away with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| I wasn't interested in the written aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| But obviously I made it too simple, or I was going to make it too simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| I'll just pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| So I would just like to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| So Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| So at this point, there's no motion for this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| So if this board just proceeds on, then this policy has no changes for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1555)|
| 0:26:10| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| I guess I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| At this point, are we giving you instruction to come back with new wording next month for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1574)|
| 0:26:24| I thought that's what we all wanted, or a lot of us seem to want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| So what I'll tell you, what my office will do is we will bring some wording to change this policy for next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1589)|
| 0:26:38| because that's what's been expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| But at this time, there's no motion to do anything with this policy for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| So would we need to make a motion to defer consideration until May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| No, you don't have to, because what I can tell you what I will do is I will bring some rewording of this policy for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| Okay, and then we'll just put it back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1619)|

| 0:27:12| We need to not do this one, because those two go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| So we need to put this one next month, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1636)|

| 0:29:42| Ms. Satterfield, do we have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1782)|

| 0:30:13| Thank you, Madam Chair and board members for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| I am here today not only as a representative for District 2 residents, but also as a former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1816)|

| 0:30:26| I'm here today to discuss equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| While the immediate response to the word seems to invoke racial connotations, equity is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| something much more than just race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| My daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes on September 23, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| She attends a small Knox County elementary school with a population of only 350 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| However, of those 350 students, two of them are type 1 diabetic or what is considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| insulin dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Because of our low school population, our nurse must split her time at our school with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| another elementary school about 15 minutes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| We had an issue just this morning with my daughter's blood sugar being high, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| needed the nurse to check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| However, the nurse was not scheduled to be at our school until after lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| There have been other occasions where her blood sugar has dropped dangerously low and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| the nurse was at her other assigned school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| In this situation, the time it takes for the nurse at the nearby middle school to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| my daughter can literally mean life and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| My child's needs are not being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| How many students' needs are not being met because we look at equity with an incredibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| narrow focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| This is equity or lack thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| This is my daughter's identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| This is where we as a school system must do better to meet the needs of all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| Yes, equity can deal with race, but we have to get away from the idea that equity is only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| dealing with race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Passing this equity policy is just one step this body can take to ensure that students'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| identities will not predict or predetermine their success in our school district, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1933)|
| 0:32:21| the necessary resources are allocated to ensure that every student receives what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Thank you for your consideration of my child and the other 59,999 students in this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1949)|

| 0:32:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| That concludes the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| Ms. Satterfield, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| So we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| My points won't be long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| We've talked about this policy since January now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| I just wanted to make a comment related to Ms. Owens' thoughts on Monday about the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| equity policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| At that time, Ms. Owens referenced some relationships possibly involved with the Tennessee Leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| for Equity playbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| I think I'm going to use a phrase that my pastor uses all the time, that this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| This policy on face value has nothing to do with the privatization of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| I went back and listened to the list again that Ms. Owens referenced, and none of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| institutions or individuals are referenced in the acknowledgments of the Tennessee Leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| for Equity playbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I think the only specific language in this policy from that actual playbook is those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| seven commitments to equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| I know that people have varying different reasons for supporting or not supporting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| policy, but I would hope that when we have policies like this and other things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| can take them at face value and look at them for what they're trying to do and be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| I would also ask that when we vote for this tonight that we do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| If you would afford me the opportunity, I'd love to hear the reason why each person is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| not voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Mainly because I think it's important for the Alliance for Educational Equity and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| stakeholders who are involved in this work for Knox County Schools to be able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| a sense from the board as individuals about where the challenges are so that way as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| group moves forward and also the central office that we can be better attuned to the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| A roll call vote will be fine, but I object to Mr. Watson trying to require each board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| member to state why they're voting for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| I don't think that we should take up that time and I don't really think he has that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2110)|
| 0:35:20| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Mr. McMillan, I wasn't requiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| I said if you would do me the courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| And if you don't want to, that's completely fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| I'm certainly not going to make demands of any of you as individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Okay, so we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| Ms. Coatney, do you want to do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Ms. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Ms. Babb, did you want to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| You're changing it to no or you don't want to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| Yes, that happened once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| I'm going to pass, and I will give an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| I feel like we talked about this a lot in policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| and part of the discussion was feeling the need that we needed to discuss parts of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| And so I think that was one thing we did was talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| and I think we've already scheduled a discussion of a lot of the metrics and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| So that's my reason for passing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2199)|
| 0:36:46| Madam Chair, that vote was two yes votes, six no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| So as we continue to move forward and talk about these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| I would like this board to be reminded that there's communities that's been waiting on this school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| to do something about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| So take all the time you need to talk, but there's people waiting for us to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| And so whenever you're ready, just let us know, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| So that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2235)|

| 0:39:48| Since it's ESSER funds that are being used, what does the three additional years mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2388)|
| 0:40:04| That's kind of Freddy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2404)|

| 0:41:31| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| So a motion by Ms. Spab, a second by Ms. Satterfield, and I believe we have public forum, Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| Yes, we have two for public forum. First, we have Caitlin Jones. If you state your name, county of residence, and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2498)|
| 0:41:49| My name is Caitlin Jones, and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2509)|
| 0:41:57| Since the beginning of this court order mask mandate, parents, students, and the communities have been told by the law department that they are doing everything they could do to get masks out of our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2517)|
| 0:42:06| Some of you have even defended the law department and their extreme incompetence in this case and said that there was no need for an outside attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2526)|
| 0:42:14| The last time I spoke in front of this board, I told you all that it was a safety risk for Alex's teachers wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| I told you the consequences we were seeing, such as Alex's lack of education and the black eye he got at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| I asked the IEP team for his teachers to wear clear face shields, and they denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| I followed the steps as I was advised by the special education director and was given more hoops to jump through, and once again, no remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| I took my case before a judge where Amanda Morse, who was appointed to the case by law director Buick, fought against me tooth and nail to keep Alex's teachers in masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2556)|
| 0:42:45| It's on court record. Once I told her I would not be signing a proposal spoken about in the mediation session, she immediately filed a motion to dismiss on a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| My first issue here is there was clearly a conflict of interest on her behalf as I worked with her at the beginning of this mandate to file a death position in the school's favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2573)|
| 0:43:01| Secondly, how could the same attorney claim to not want our kids in masks while arguing in another case for the teachers to be wearing a mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| If there is one thing that is clear, the attorneys in the law director's office and Mr. Buick himself are not arguing the case for our children and parents and staff, but instead for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2588)|
| 0:43:18| The school administration's arguments were that Alex listened to the teachers' directions 50% of the time if they pulled their masks down so Alex could see their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| Let me be very clear. It only takes one time for him not to listen and Alex could be seriously injured or dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| They argued that Alex was in the least restrictive environment when his teachers pulled the masks down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| But according to Alex's doctors, which I have a note, and according to history, that's not true. The black eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| I understand we are currently not in masks, but there may very well come a time when we are back in masks, which is why I'm being a voice for Alex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| I know some of you do not want our children in masks, but let's face it, the law director's office has proven they only care about protecting the school system and not the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| When I had to sit and listen to the attorney supposedly fighting for our kids to keep masks on teachers, I lost all faith in the law department and the attorneys who represent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2638)|
| 0:44:08| Earlier, I guess, you discussed an equity policy that has somehow gotten worse than the first one proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| At least the first one attempted to hide the true intent behind it by adding children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| This new policy does not have anything but one word, talking about children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| Let's just call it as it is, and it's pandering to one side of the political aisle, all while the attorneys in this school district are fighting to discriminate against our kids in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2665)|
| 0:44:34| This horrendous act shows that we need outside counsel to represent our kids and to not protect the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| Because of this, I urge you to hire outside counsel immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Next we have Randy Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| She's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| All right, Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Yes, I have a question. I don't know if this is for Mr. Dupler or someone else, but how many people were considered when we decided to go with this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2698)|
| 0:45:09| Is this a question for you or someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| I would say it's for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| You know, let me just I can't I can't really address the speaker much, but I can say that our office disagrees with the assertions of the speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2717)|
| 0:45:28| The Knox County School System and the law department cannot discuss any details due to state and federal privacy law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| But the law department has fought against mask mandates and will continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| As far as attorneys considered, our office can consider various attorneys across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2742)|
| 0:45:52| A lot of the attorneys this this board would likely be familiar with due to connections with TSBA as they are speakers that frequently present, which Scott Bennett is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2752)|
| 0:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| Miss Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Thank you, Madam Chair. I have two questions for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| First, just for the public, could you clarify what this attorney's role would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2775)|
| 0:46:22| So pursuant to the board's own motion, this attorney's role would be to advise the law department in a consultative role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2782)|
| 0:46:35| And so with that role, we would we would certainly bring this attorney in, whether it's Scott Bennett or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| But I mean, obviously, Scott Bennett would be a great choice should the board choose to to choose him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| But he would be brought in, be brought up to speed and then would obviously be consulted when any any type of significant decisions would be made in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2809)|
| 0:46:59| So he would not be litigating in place of the attorneys we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| No, no, he would not be able to to appear in court on behalf of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| That would be our role. But I mean, certainly, like I say, he would he would be consulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Thank you. And my second question, could you speak to the potential cost that we might be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2834)|
| 0:47:22| It would be a guesstimate. You know, obviously, it's going to take some money, some time and money for him to get up to speed, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2842)|
| 0:47:31| But then then, of course, it depends upon how much activity there is in the case from now until conclusion, whether or not this thing goes all the way to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2851)|
| 0:47:41| Obviously, there's mediation pending soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| So, you know, I would I would say, you know, a minimum between ten and twenty thousand and then just could go could go up considerably from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2866)|
| 0:47:56| just depending upon the time involved in the time and the amount, the length of time of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you. So looking at looking at his rate, if if he were to work full time for two weeks, we would be looking at a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2882)|
| 0:48:15| So between between that bottom estimate and say a two week estimate, we're looking at anywhere between the cost of a teaching assistant and the cost of a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2895)|
| 0:48:29| And I think this board really needs to think about whether that is a reasonable cost for litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| That is that that is concluding really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| Miss Henderson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| I'm going to have to vote no on this just because I would like to see other candidates brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| I know. Well, you know, one of the so they list significant special education and disability cases, which Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2932)|
| 0:49:03| Bennett has handled in federal court, which nothing against Mr. Bennett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| I'm sure he's a great person. But in L.H. versus Hamilton County Schools, he did lose that case for the county against the same lawyers who are suing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2946)|
| 0:49:15| So to put a losing case is one of his I don't know, on his resume to us just is a little discerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2955)|
| 0:49:24| So that's why I'm going to have to vote no on this. And I would like to see other candidates brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| I would like to see an attorney who wins 88 cases and at the appeals level. We're losing on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| So I don't think we need to add somebody who's losing to the same lawyers that we're losing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| So that's all I have to say. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you, Madam Chair. First, just a point of clarification for the for the public tonight's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| And I can be correct if I'm wrong. Tonight's vote is not whether or not we are authorizing the law department to hire a attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| That vote's already been made. The board voted to approve the hiring of an outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| So this vote is simply about who to hire. And at this point, to Ms. Henderson's point, this is the only candidate that's been brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3002)|
| 0:50:10| Is that correct? That's actually what we're voting on, correct? It's not authorizing hiring of a attorney. It's this attorney, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| That is correct. Okay. So just want to make sure that people understand that, that that vote's already been made in a prior meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| And then I know this attorney's rate is listed in the literature of $350 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| I know that I believe Director Buch made comment to a range he felt like between 200 to $400 an hour is probably where we would probably be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3030)|
| 0:50:42| Mr. Dupler, because I do think cost is a consideration for some folks when they're thinking about this, even from a public standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| Did you see a lot of range in other potential folks that you looked at, or is that about where it's at? Does that make sense what I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3047)|
| 0:50:58| I think that's a proper range. Yes. Right. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| Yeah. I mean, this type of work, I think you're going to be hard-pressed to find anybody at $200 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| I mean, it's going to be in that upper part of the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| Just a quick point of clarification. So you mentioned the conclusion of the case, which at this point we don't know when that will be, regardless of what happens with the vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3076)|
| 0:51:26| Is the potential contract with this attorney or any other, or retainer with any other attorney, through now to the time of the conclusion of the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3086)|
| 0:51:36| And how is that defined? When is this case actually concluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| I mean, there are several different possible conclusions, but I guess what I'm asking is, I think it's important for the public to know, when would we not be hiring this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| When would this person not be on retainer anymore? When does it end? Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| Sure. The normal conclusion of a case filed in the trial court would either be a trial ending the case or some type of resolution, such as a settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3113)|
| 0:52:05| After that, you're looking at an appeal, and normally when you retain an attorney, you're looking at a settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| With this attorney, it's just for the trial. It would be something separate for the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| Okay. And so this attorney right now, the agreement that's being considered would keep this person on retainer for this case through conclusion, or is this simply we're paying for, is there no real retainer, and are we just paying for actual time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3136)|
| 0:52:34| Well, it's just time. I mean, a retainer can be something completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| A lot of times in retaining an attorney, you pay that attorney a fee so that you can just call up whenever you'd like and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3161)|
| 0:52:50| Any attorney at this point, what we would be asking is just bill for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| Yeah. The reason I'm asking this question is I think it's important for the public to know that this person would only get paid for actual time billed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3175)|
| 0:53:03| That even if, let's say, all their time is up front loaded right now in the next two weeks, and they don't do anything for a month, they're not getting continued time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3183)|
| 0:53:11| They're not continually paid for that time. They're not doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| And I think that's important to note in terms of the agreement and how it's set up. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| Ms. Fabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| Yes, and I don't know how the vote would go on Mr. Bennett, but if it does not go for Mr. Bennett, I would really like for us to, if there is another candidate, to have a special called meeting to move forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| because we got this a while ago about him, and I actually had expected us to go ahead and have a meeting to do it, because what we're having is it's getting very drawn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3211)|
| 0:53:45| So, I would hope if this person is not selected and there's another person to come before us, that we can work a little bit more timely than waiting for monthly meetings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3225)|
| 0:53:55| And then, just as far as the rate, I actually had an attorney I know that approached me just to say, you know, if you're going to do this, you're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| And he was just saying they were interested, and I know, probably, I think spoke to the law department, because I have no way of hiring them, but the rate was basically exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| So, I am thinking that that's probably a similar rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you, Madam Chair. I also spoke with a private attorney who said that this was well within the range. He would say that $300 to $400 would be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| I'd also like to note that it's not just the hourly that we're looking at. We're also looking at any expenses incurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3265)|
| 0:54:34| So, any kind of travel, lodging, meals, whatever expenses might be incurred would also be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3274)|
| 0:54:44| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| If this motion does fail, I would like to have a meeting to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| And I'd also like to see a list of candidates and their qualifications, too, so that we have multiple candidates that we can look at, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3294)|
| 0:55:07| I would say that if we're going to have a special called meeting, we probably need options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| I mean, we can't have a special called meeting after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| I mean, you know what I'm saying. That would kind of get us in the weeds and hard to coordinate everyone's schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| So, we probably would maybe need more than one, just to avoid having multiple special called meetings, if the same thing happened, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| I think my question goes back to timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3336)|
| 0:55:44| So, if we chose to approve this this evening, would this attorney be assisting in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| Because the way I understand that, since the paperwork has been filed, it can't be amended at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3350)|
| 0:56:03| Is that correct? And would this person be assisting in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| It's a good question, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| And you raise a good point, which would be, at this point in the process, the only thing remaining in the current Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| which is just on the preliminary injunction, is the oral argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| So, whoever is hired, assuming they're hired before oral argument, which I believe is May 4th, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3385)|
| 0:56:35| then if they're hired before that, then we would do everything we could to involve that person and get advice before the oral argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| And then the mediation, like I say, is the other pending event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3401)|
| 0:56:52| So, same thing, but we're trying to schedule that mediation in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3412)|
| 0:57:01| This would be assuming that whoever is hired is hired before that mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to speak to process a little bit in terms of how Mr. Bennett came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| I'm trying to reflect back on the prior meetings that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| My understanding is that the board, in its vote, gave the authority to the law director to hire outside counsel to advise on the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| But it is the law director's, it's their sole responsibility to make that hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3446)|
| 0:57:37| but the board has asked for us to approve any potential recommended hire. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| And the reason I'm asking that question is I understand the desire to look at multiple candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| but I don't know that we actually have that authority to pick and choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| And if Mr. Buch was here, I would ask him the question, but I don't know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| and I'm not asking you to speak for Director Buch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| but we're kind of making an assumption possibly that he's willing to bring us multiple candidates at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| and have an open conversation about it, which I just think from a process standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| I don't know that that's what we agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| Coming up with the candidate he wanted and saying, do you want them or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| I think that's kind of where we're at, and Mr. Buechler, if you have any light to shine on that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| I mean, I think that's the essence of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| I'll be happy to go back to the law director and see about bringing multiple potential candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| but I do believe you're correct on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| I mean, that would be, we would have to contact those multiple potential candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3531)|
| 0:59:00| and they would have to agree to be discussed in an open meeting and picked apart on their resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3540)|
| 0:59:08| So I mean, not every attorney may be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| So we would have to get that permission before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| But if that's what the board wants us to do, then we will certainly take a look at that and report back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Dupler. Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just have a question, Mr. Dupler, just more of a legal process question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| So if we lose at the Sixth Circuit, would we then appeal to the Supreme Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3576)|
| 0:59:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| So what we have right now is a preliminary injunction that was not a trial court decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| And that's part of what's been so aggravating about this case from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| They filed for a preliminary injunction, brought in doctors that they had available that we didn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| very early on, just days after the case was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| So that preliminary injunction was handed down, and we appealed it to the Sixth Circuit as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3611)|
| 1:00:19| But the answer would be, I mean, if the Sixth Circuit rules against us, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| we feel good about them ruling for us, but there's no guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| So if it is sent back down to the trial court, then that's what will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| It will be sent back down to the trial court for us to proceed along in the case as one normally does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| That would be what's called discovery, and on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| trying to find out more information in preparation for a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| Could the case eventually go up to the Supreme Court? The answer is yes, but that would be after a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| Do you think your office currently can handle all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| like a trial and a possible going to the Supreme Court level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| They're not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| I think what he's saying is, we don't simultaneously, if I'm understanding you correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| we're not going to go to the Supreme Court until after we go to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| But is the office capable of handling both of those things, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| Certainly. I mean, we have attorneys licensed in the Eastern District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| the Sixth Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3688)|
| 1:01:38| Okay, so we have a motion by Ms. Babb and a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3698)|
| 1:01:46| So do we want to do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| Ms. Satterfield? Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| Ms. Owen? Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| Mr. Watson? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Ms. Babb? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Ms. Horne? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Ms. Henderson? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Ms. Bounds? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Mr. McMillan? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Ms. Christy? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| Ms. Satterfield, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| What's the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| There's five yes votes and two no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| Okay, now I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| And Ms. Owen, would you like to change your pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Okay, that's five yes votes, two no votes, and two pass votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| Item 10B, approve a school construction budget line item transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| in the amount of $2 million from land acquisition account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| to Title IX account for the West High School softball project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Motion by Ms. Babb, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3775)|

| 1:03:07| Motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| Any discussion? Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| For those in the public who are not intimately involved in the education system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| and may be a part of other industries, I think tenure can be an interesting concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| And so, Mr. McPherson, would you speak to tenure and its purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| and why are we approving a list like this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Yes, Mr. Watson, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| Tenure is a way of rewarding and recognizing teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| who have been with us for the past, for at least five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| And also they would be required, it would be for those who have achieved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| a level of overall effectiveness score of at least four or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| So these are our highest performers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| Would you say it's fair, would it be fair to say that we don't just hand out tenure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Oh, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you. I just want to give that credit where it's due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| and also make sure that people understand what it's for and why we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Mr. Watson, for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| I think it's also important to note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| tenure does not give teachers some kind of grand guarantee of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| It gives them due process, and that's really all it gives is due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| So we have a motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Item 10D, approved contract of employment with Dr. John Ryswick as director of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3887)|
| 1:04:55| Motion by Ms. Fab, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| There was some discussion at the work session, and there's some slight modified language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| Mr. Dupley, would you mind just reading the modifications just so the public knows the changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| And then also, if you wouldn't mind also speaking to the two or three major changes in this contract versus other contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3916)|
| 1:05:24| just so the public is aware of kind of the different points that were negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| So first you wanted me to talk about where you had asked for the change in Section 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| Is that what you were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| So I talked to Dr. Ryswick, and we talked about making that slight change just to make it clear what the contract is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3943)|
| 1:05:54| So what it's saying now is that each year in October or by October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| the director and the board will develop an annual action plan of 10 to 15 objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3961)|
| 1:06:11| and that's what he was talking about on Monday night, being able to be nimble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| and being able to look at what might be more of a hot-button topic for that year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3975)|
| 1:06:22| as opposed to just sticking with the same strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| And what that will do then is that will then complement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| and perhaps amend the current strategic plan that the board and the director has as far as a multiyear, usually four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3990)|
| 1:06:39| So that's the intent of that section of the contract, and that's been modified to make that more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=3999)|
| 1:06:48| And then, Mr. Watson, you were also asking about some of the major changes to this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4008)|
| 1:06:56| versus the one that was originally presented to the board as more of a form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4016)|
| 1:07:04| And you all talked about on Monday night, as far as the compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| Dr. Ryswick wants to go with the $240,000 instead of the $250,000, and then a $10,000 performance bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4028)|
| 1:07:17| And then, I'm just flipping through here, Section 7 and Section 8, which you all also talked about on Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4037)|
| 1:07:25| those were new features to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| I think the other probably major new feature, other than what's already been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| is the tenure and transfer section in Mr. Thomas' contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| I mean, you know, he has tenure and wanted to keep that tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| Dr. Ryswick's saying that he's not interested in tenure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| that he would rather stay in the director's position instead of going to any other position with KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| And he can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Yeah, okay, yeah, he's nodding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| We had a lot of conversation about dates on Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| and so in thinking through just the calendar, our discussion on Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| Mr. McMillan suggested getting through graduations, which I spoke with Danny Trent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| and graduations end on June 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| So I think maybe it would split the difference if we go with Mr. McMillan's suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| and maybe have a start date of June 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| and move Mr. Thomas into a consultant role at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| so that it would move the timeline up by a month from what's on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| So I'm not making a motion at this point, but I would like to offer that as a point of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4132)|
| 1:09:00| Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| And I'm not speaking to that, I'm looking at a previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| Looking at number six, and I'm not suggesting that we add this in the contract at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| but I would ask that whomever may be chair at the time in the Law Department and Dr. Reiswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4151)|
| 1:09:19| be sure that the research office and Mr. Roeder are involved in making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| that those performance objectives are reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4165)|
| 1:09:35| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| And I did watch Monday's meeting, so I followed the whole discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| And I actually think for the purposes that I think everybody's talking about, I feel like June is too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4181)|
| 1:09:50| I feel like so much of what we're really discussing is the decisions that take place in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| I mean, so many of the principal positions for the most part do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| But listening to the discussion, I very much do think Mr. Thomas needs to be at the graduation ceremonies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4201)|
| 1:10:10| as the representative of being the superintendent for all these kids who are graduating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| I mean, I think you symbolically are the leader of the school for those kids graduating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| So I don't know how – I like the date being May 1st personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| But with that being, we know Mr. Thomas is staying on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| We want him to stay on an advisory role, and I think he very much needs to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| personally, I want him to be very actively involved with the graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| because I think symbolically he is the leader for those kids that are graduating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| So I would prefer the May 1st date over the June date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| I was just going to speak on what – in reference to what Ms. Horne said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| And I think some type of compromise might be workable here, something that we could all buy into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4263)|
| 1:11:17| And I said the other night that I thought they worked well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| Mr. Thomas said that I believe – you correct me if I'm wrong, Bob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4285)|
| 1:11:33| but did you not say that it was going to be John's decisions and you thought that he should –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4293)|
| 1:11:45| if you maintained the role, you would not object to anything that he was wanting to do prior to you leaving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4305)|
| 1:11:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Having said that, when's the last high school graduation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| June 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| June 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| And so Monday is June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| That's a Friday and Monday is June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| What – how many are there – is there one June 2nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4338)|
| 1:12:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| You don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| I'm sure Ms. Kelly knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| I see her opening her notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| June 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| Hall High School at 9 a.m. and Gibbs High School at 6 p.m. on June 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| On June 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| And that's the last of the high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| Is there one on June 3rd also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| There's one on June 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Fullerton High School at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| South Door High School at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| I guess having thoroughly discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4394)|
| 1:13:25| maybe I would like to make a motion that we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| that Mr. Thomas remain officially superintendent through the last graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4412)|
| 1:13:44| which would be June 3rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| and Dr. Reiswick officially take over his duties on Monday, June 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4427)|
| 1:14:00| or whatever that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Is that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| You know, that's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| However, as you're saying that, I'm thinking we don't need a lapse, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| because we would need a superintendent at all times, would we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| We're not going to have a lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| Well, even the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| I mean, the weekend we would have a lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| So, I mean, this is such a big job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| That's what I suggested today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| Then let's make it June 3rd at –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Yeah, midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| Well, I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| Dr. Reiswick, do you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| would you object to basically what I'm recommending, or what are your thoughts on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4489)|
| 1:14:58| Well, thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| As long as I don't have to be up at midnight, I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| No, I think –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| just to say kind of what we said Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| I mean, you know, Bob and I have gotten along great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| and have a good working relationship, you know, to be able to work in these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| and I think we'll continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| And I think, you know, what you're recommending, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| still gives us time to do some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| As we were thinking through that, you know, I have a chief academic officer to hire, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| because I won't be in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| So there are some of those kinds of things that still have to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| and some transitions and, you know, communicating that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| making sure the schools understand, you know, our priorities and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| And I do think that's critical, you know, before they leave in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| so we can start having those discussions, you know, prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| But I think, you know, Mr. Thomas and I could probably pull that off and be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| We've been fine the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| So I feel like I know you, both of you, fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4549)|
| 1:15:57| And I think you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| You seem to work together really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Well, having said that, this would not, I'm assuming, would not hinder something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| if you wanted to do something with a certain group, certain principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4570)|
| 1:16:18| You know, I'm talking about for a given school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| You know, you could have that individual discussion as early as, you know, first week in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4585)|
| 1:16:33| Could you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| I mean, typically that is the time frame when we're doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| because, again, it's important for schools and teachers to understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| if there are changes in leadership or changes in those kinds of things in their school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| and typically we try to have that done before they go to break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| So, you know, I would anticipate that again, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| with Mr. Thomas' support happening, you know, prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| Well, that was kind of what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| You all could go ahead and give the expectations for what a given school was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4622)|
| 1:17:12| or a particular group or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| and everybody that you're dealing with is going to know what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| But that allows Mr. Thomas to efficiently be that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| and then, you know, of course, I guess salary-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| you would start whenever at midnight on whatever the date was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4654)|
| 1:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| I'll propose that if anybody is interested in seconding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| So we have a motion by Mr. McMillan to have the start date on June 3rd at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4678)|
| 1:18:08| Or would that be June 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| It would be 1159.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| 1159.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| On June 3rd or midnight on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Are you taking notes, Dr. Rice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| 1159.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| It's like your New Year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| 1159 on June 3rd, and at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| Mr. Thomas would move into an advisory or consultant role until June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4708)|
| 1:18:38| And Ms. Bounds, you have seconded that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| One for Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| From an HR perspective, does it help to start at 12 a.m. on the 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| like that one minute of pay on the day before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| I don't know if that helps or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| I know he's not getting paid daily, but I don't know if that makes it cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| Well, I mean, normally in like an employment contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| we would just 12 o'clock or 12.01 would be assumed as the day is named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| So it would be like June 4th, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| then automatically at 12.01 or 12.00 midnight, June 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| So from a technical standpoint, maybe that's the way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| And then my second question is for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| So I agree and supportive of starting the switch earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| but from a technical standpoint, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| the board only has authority to hire the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| So if we're suggesting now that we would like to see Mr. Thomas move into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| paid to see out his contract advisory or consultant role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| what, if any action does this board need to take to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| Or is that really us entrusting Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| Risewick when he takes that position to do that, to move him into that role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| So there's some moving parts here that I think we need to understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| implications of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| And are there multiple actions we need to be taking to accomplish it versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| just a start date of a contract for a superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| which I think might leave Mr. Thomas or superintendent Thomas officially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| hanging unless we take official action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| So thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| So and maybe I was zoning out, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| I don't know if Mr. McMillan presented a substitute motion or not, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| that motion would have to be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| But but but such a motion, as I heard it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| was proposed would also take care of Mr. Thomas's contract, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| which if you're accelerating Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| Risewick's contract, I mean, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| that's going to necessarily affect Mr. Thomas's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| And, you know, if this board says move him into a consultative role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| then certainly certainly the two of them can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| can work that out as far as Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Risewick would then have the ultimate authority to work that out to two on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| details as to exactly what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| But I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| the board would be would be keeping Mr. Thomas at his at his same rate of pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| for that position and would keep him on until the end of his contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| which is June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| Sure. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| I just want to be real clear about who needs to be doing what through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| process that we're really in some ways entrusting Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| Risewick and Superintendent Thomas to work out the details of that in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Ms. Thorne. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| As Ms. Babson, you watched the meeting on Monday, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| I was very concerned about the May 1st date because I definitely want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| sure that Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Risewick has time to get people in positions and do all those things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| are normally done in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| So I still have that concern, even though I'm fine with this compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| I still have that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| And so, you know, I, I, I think that, you know, if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| if Mr. Thomas is agreeable to work with Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Risewick and kind of let him go forward with what plans need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| then, you know, I'm definitely comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| So, and I believe you, you've stated that a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| So, so, so I feel like this will be a good kind of compromise and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| and certainly we do want to honor Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| Thomas's commitment to our school system for all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| So, so I hope that this shows that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| that we want to do that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| I guess for the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| did I understand you correctly that my motion needed to be a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Then I will formally change what I said to a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| And I assume Ms. Bounds will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| She said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| So any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| And I will be supportive of that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| because I think we do need to be mindful that we do not have a chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| academic officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| So it would not be fair to have you do both jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| I'm assuming that one's a big job too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| So I will be supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| Just one final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| And I mentioned this to Superintendent Thomas shortly after his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| I know that your heart is to finish strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| And I think this allows you to do that with this current class and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| students that you've been walking alongside and those educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| So I appreciate your intent on wanting to finish strong and not just kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| of chill out for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Ms. Coatney, will you read that substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| The substitute motion by Mr. McMillan is for Bob Thomas to remain as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| superintendent through the last high school graduation on June 3rd and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| Dr. John Roswick to officially start as superintendent on June 4th at 12.01| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| And we had a second by Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| So do we want to do a roll call vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Madam Chair, just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Because I thought I heard Mr. Dupler say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| Is there anything that we need in that substitute motion to address the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| of Mr. Thomas staying on in an advisory capacity or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| I just want to make sure that I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| I just wanted to just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| So, I mean, the two contracts, you know, just complement each other, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| So, I mean, once you vote, if you vote that Dr. Roswick starts on June 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| then at that time Mr. Thomas would move into a consultative role because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| Because there's a term in Mr. Thomas' contract that would require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5114)|

| 1:25:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| I believe we also have a policy that this would fall under that allows the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| superintendent to organize the central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5120)|

| 1:25:42| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5143)|

| 1:25:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| Okay, so motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| And item 10E, approve resolution to increase Title IX management and address claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5148)|
| 1:25:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| A motion by Ms. Babb, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5163)|

| 1:26:38| Thank you for finally affording me the opportunity to speak about the ethics complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| that I had filed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Since the opportunity wasn't afforded to me then, I'm going to speak about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| I have this uncanny ability and resourcefulness to find information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| I have been able to uncover this board's members' posts on social media and websites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5215)|

| 1:27:05| The Supreme Court in the 4th District has ruled that social media is a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5225)|

| 1:27:15| Having an official page and a private profile does not necessarily safeguard you from these rulings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5235)|

| 1:27:52| You will find that she has deleted content off her profiles, off her groups, and her website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| On February 22nd, after she was called out at a meeting by a parent at the Knox County Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5279)|
| 1:28:08| she began scrubbing her website, her Facebook pages, her profile, her groups, of all the content that goes against her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5288)|
| 1:28:22| And as of today, it has since been cleared off of her official website, the webcatch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5302)|

| 1:29:06| I come before the board today to demand that she not just recuse herself, but I demand that she resigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5346)|
| 1:29:13| If not, this will be a very public and embarrassing legal scandal on her behalf. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220406?start=5353)|
